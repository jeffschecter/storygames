The concept was borrowed from <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>: gun-toting holy man comes to town and stirs things up with his rigid definition of what's right and what's wrong by the standards of his faith.  It seemed like a solid enough approach and dovetailed well with the other two characters being put forth.<br/><br/>Then I was told that I didn't understand what <i>Apocalypse World</i> is about.  Apparently it's about playing schlubs who never amount to anything and when a player makes a decision for their character, it's about getting screwed over.  Which leads me to ask: who the hell would want to play such a game?<br/><br/>I don't play roleplaying games to be a chartered accountant.  If I want to go to college, settle down, have kids and cruise into retirement age I can play <i>The Game of LIFE</i>.  And if I want to be punished for every decision I make regardless of their merit or lack thereof I can spend an afternoon talking with my dad.<br/><br/>To be fair to <i>Apocalypse World</i>, I don't think that's <i>really</i> what the game's about.  There might be challenges that a character faces and they may not all go well.  My hardened preacher-type may be forced to deal with the consequences of his own actions or even into facing the rectitude of his path.  <i>That's</i> a game worth playing.  I don't think anyone in his right mind would design a game that specifically sets out to subvert player expectations and goals.<br/><br/>I've raised some issues over time about playing difficult roles and/or roleplaying challenging situations, but never once have I ever heard it even hinted that the game itself could become the enemy and that the characters portrayed should be as limp and ineffective as possible.  I ask again: who would want to play a game like that?  And more importantly, <i>why?!?</i><br/><br/>Certainly there are some who find the roleplaying of damaged or inadequate people in bad situations makes for a good time.  I'm going to play a game of <i>Fiasco</i> next week and I'm sure there'll be a lot of that.  But in the case of such a game, it's not a question of punishing players but of seeing who can come up with the next colossal goatfuck that will drive the outrageous humor.  It's <i>the point of the game</i> and rewards players for screwing themselves over.  The way <i>Apocalypse World</i>'s being tarred, though, it sounds like an exercise in auto-flagellation.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm asking is: why are you playing your games?  Do you derive satisfaction from being dissatisfied, or something else?  Does it makes sense to create a game whose only function is to crush the spirits of those who play it?  Would <i>you</i> play such a game?  And what's all this about playing schlubs?  Is that really something you'd want to do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250687/#Comment_250687" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T16:05:10+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  4:05PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2010 4:08PM by Jesse.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't speak to Apocalypse World too specifically but I think I may be able to better articulate what Ralph was trying to get at.<br/><br/>There's a difference between playing The Preacher, which is a heroic archetype and playing a self-righteous man willing to back up his beliefs with a gun.  Ralph is saying you can do the latter but you can't do the former.  This distinction in my mind is very clear but it is very difficult to describe.  A heroic archetype commands a certain kind of automatic attention and respect on the part of the authors and audience (not necessarily the fictional people of the world).  I think Ralph is saying that Apocalypse World does not give you the tools to deliver that attention and respect.  If on the other hand, you want to play a self-righteous man willing to back up his beliefs with a gun, that's just find.  We just don't know and can't control how much attention and respect he's going to get.<br/><br/>What Ralph is saying reminds me a lot of how Spione plays.  Spione is Ron Edward's spy fiction game that is about as far away from James Bond as you can imagine.  It specifically takes place in cold-war era Berlin and the two (always two) spies involved in the story are just ordinary people on the take from the other side.  The game is largely about watching the job of being a spy slowly erode away everything the principles care about.<br/><br/>Or take a look at Seth-Ben Ezra's jeepform inspired game A Flower For Mara in which the players are simply members of a family dealing with the death of loved one.  The game involves revealing and sharing a real world grief that you personally struggle with.  I've played it and cried very, very heavily while doing it.  And yet, I enjoyed it and I'd play it again in heart beat.<br/><br/>For me, I like intimate personal stories and games like this deliver that in spades.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250688/#Comment_250688" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T16:08:16+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  4:08PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the main problem with your character and apocalypse world is that in AW your group is centered around a hardhold.

You'd think that given the skillsets most of us have developed from playing RPGs (generating Champions characters, managing the equipment list for a D&amp;D character, etc.), a good solid chartered-accountant game would be a natural.

(in the other thread). That's because you didn't actually say what you wanted your character to be able to do (well, roll into town all bad-ass, okay, but that's a bit vague) -- you said <i>who you wanted him to be</i>. And the truth is that AW isn't going to let you be that super bad-ass dude every single roll, for sure, but given a list of actions you want to be almost-always bad-ass at doing, I can make an AW character that delivers. I mean, shit, if you really want to game the game, you can have a character that gets +3 for every one of his moves within 5 advances (or pretty damn close to it). I don't really see the schlub thing going on, unless you do it deliberately, or maybe you roll nothing but snake-eyes.<br/><br/>And, y'know, if you ask for specific advice on making a character, and Ralph (for example) doesn't actually give you any, you could just tell him to fuck off, then get your thread back on track, yeah?<br/><br/><br/>And finally: yes, you fucking should want to play a chartered accountant. An anecdote: I remember the WotC adds for DnD that had a picture of every fan-boy's favorite man-crush Drizzt the Dork Elf with the words: "because nobody plays a balding, slightly overweight middle manager of a midwestern paper company" (or something). So I decided that would be my next character. My next game? Don't Rest Your Head. I was a bading, slightly overweight middle manager of a box-making company who couldn't stop playing video games, seeing dominatrixes, and holding down a second job with a rival box company, with re-spawning and save-point powers, who ended up traveling through time while battling phantom gangster thugs at his own box factory. The session ended with his 24-hour-long interview for a job at WotC.

As the game plays out the club members will change their lives, for good or ill (and there is a dial in the game to set whether things are headed for loss and madness, simple change, or new growth and improvement). I'm not sure if confronting your abusive boss or clearing the air with an ex you wronged is an extraordinary action, but in a game of Savagery it is compelling. <br/><br/>And yes, there is nothing wrong with choosing the local organization of chartered accountants as your club.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250765/#Comment_250765" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T07:40:40+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  7:40AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite><br/>My question here has to do with the way Ralph seemed to perceive<i>Apocalypse World</i>: as a game in which characters are resolutely ordinary and their actions are consistently subverted.

It may be accurate for you, and there is nothing wrong with that in the least, but it's probably useful to be aware that some players are completely cool with schlub PCs who don't succeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250799/#Comment_250799" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T10:07:11+00:00" title="January 14, 2010 10:07AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite><i>Apocalypse World</i>: as a game in which <b>characters</b> are resolutely <b>ordinary</b> and <b>their actions</b> are consistently <b>subverted</b>.  ...

You go from ordinary characters whose actions are subverted to a gaming experience geared to player dissatisfaction. There's an implied premise, here; something like, "A player always cares about his character" or "Subverting ordinary characters is dissatisfying" or "Subverting character actions always leads to player dissatisfaction."<br/><br/>Fact is, a TON of games just don't make this character:player equivalence, nor assume all characters are competent, nor assume that success (or progress, even) is a goal. Basically...  what Bryant said. I can't speak for AW (never read or played it), but maybe this is a category of RPG that just doesn't suit your sensibilities?

Apparently it's about playing schlubs who never amount to anything and when a player makes a decision for their character, it's about getting screwed over.  Which leads me to ask: who the hell would want to play such a game?</blockquote>\nBecause it's probably not about getting screwed over, but getting screwed over is something that happens in game to create an emergent behaviour (a little fruitful void theory there).<br/><br/>Many RPGs use a heroic archetype that involves people wandering about being badass. But what of these other games? Let me first set up the assumption that many RPGs establish, that the fun in games is derived from achieving success, and power, in whatever form the system lists, is the means to success, and that's the core of that heroic archetype.<br/><br/>But RPGs let you choose your own goals, so what if you choose goals wherein power and badassery won't help you? I'm talking about goals of understanding and empathy (as those issues came up in another Sam H thread), about exploring and finding answers to complex and subtle moral decisions, about navigating cultural and social interplay, and much more. There are three forces that really determine what sorts of problems you'll grapple with in a game, your character design, the gamemaster (or whoever designs challenges) and the game itself. It's best if all three work together. If Apocalypse World doesn't encourage wandering badassery, it probably explores something else. Figure out what it does do, then decide if there's any part of that you want to play.<br/><br/>It is because my choice of different goals that characters for D&amp;D and similar games (especially superhero RPGs) look like a bunch of schlubs who are just set up to fail, no matter how many enemies they defeat. To that end, I create and play games about characters designed to face the sorts of problems that interest me in pursuit of the goals that interest me. To you the characters in those games may look like schlubs, but to me they look more heroic, more successful, than any badass gun-toting priest could ever be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250902/#Comment_250902" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T15:33:37+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  3:33PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX61PUZ3xkI" rel="nofollow">It's fun to charter an accountant...and sail the wide accountant-sea...</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251248/#Comment_251248" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T08:49:44+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  8:49AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>If Apocalypse World doesn't encourage wandering badassery, it probably explores something else.</blockquote>\nWell, here's the problem with <i>Apocalypse World</i>, or at least <i>my</i> problem with the game.  It kind of does seem to encourage badassery in the way it quickly empowers player characters through improvements.  But on the other hand it has a system that dials back the singularly heroic nature of PCs and makes it somewhat difficult to achieve goals.  So in this case, at least, I'm not entirely sure what Vincent Baker's trying to do, and he's not talking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251428/#Comment_251428" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T13:46:32+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  1:46PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2010 1:47PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My guess is create a setting as dangerous and awful as a post-apocalyptic world would be.

You're plunged immediately into a series of problems that threaten to destroy or irrevocably alter that community.  I predict that future chapters ramp-up the screw-down aspects much higher...though likely not as high as Dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Apocalypse World you're survivors...which makes you at least a little bit special in that the vast majority of people failed to survive.  But beyond that you're pretty typical of your archetype.  You might be the leader of a biker gang...but its a pretty small gang and there are likely dozens more even larger out there.  You might be a hard holder and responsible for 100s of lives, but you're always right at the brink of having that taken away.  In fact, the MC instructions for creating fronts and making moves with them is pretty clear in that regard as I recall.  There's alot of good specifics but mostly it boils down to "figure out what's important to the character and then figure out a way to destroy it or take it away from them".  Again...its a crucible designed to crush you...to see whether you break, or become a monster, or more rarely find some other solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters in a Baker game become memorable because of what they did during play, not who they were before play.  I'd say that's a pretty universal non-controversal Lumpley Games trait.  Character generation in all of his games is absolutely ruthless at preventing "play before you play" syndrome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be more controversal, but I think if you spend more than 1-3 sentences worth of effort envisioning who your character was before play begins (beyond the skeleton of what the creation rules outlines) you're playing in a non optimal manner for a Lumpley game.  Take Dog's creation for example.  It will tell you that you have a "complicated upbringing", but I think you're doing a disservice if you come up with more than a couple of sentences thinking about what that entailed before play begins.  That couple of sentences is all you need to set up the initial conflict, and that initial conflict is plenty to get you started into your initial town.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251548/#Comment_251548" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T06:07:16+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  6:07AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World explicitly states (and I believe Dogs and Storming do as well) that the player characters are the only hope of figuring out the mess the world is in and doing something about it.
