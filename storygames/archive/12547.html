And the really charming, interesting thing about the setting is that no matter how outlandish, they are still individuals with agency and goals (even if the goal is to wreck everything).

All my monster thinking was for naught, Joel came up with the excellent Loon Man, a murderous giant loon that tormented our village, which was on an island in a lake. I'd read about how the Hopi would put corn meal around the village to ward off some evil, so I wanted to incorporate that somehow. Two of the external threats the players authored were Loon Man and The Water is Rising, so I put those together in my first scene as Outside GM. The ring of corn meal kept Loon Man out of the village, but the rising waters were washing away the magical protection. Loon Man got in, and changed himself into a handsome stranger. After an initial conflict I spent all my victory dice to make him a friend of She Changes Minds, Shane's heroic Sweet Water clan ingenue.<br/><br/>One of my favorite moments came when I recalled that I could personify anything. So when He Hunts Clouds, Joel's dude, decided to climb the imposing mountain called Bald Face, I described how Bald Face frowned down at him and shook his head and sent a cascade of rocks falling from his wrinkles.<br/><br/>The game's situation seems to write itself - we established that the Outside Chief, His Nose Is Broken, was somehow weak, but didn't know the specifics. Once I had him shoveling corn meal and relying on a sorcerer for the village's protection, it all fell into place. Really cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281815/#Comment_281815" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T22:13:35+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 10:13PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find this setting so creatively fertile -- a great mix of familiarity with a perspective that's distinctly different, yet relatable.  It's really easy to be a neat character with lots of colorful trappings and yet be clearly human.  I've played very non-epic games, with fairly "regular people" concerns (social, food, weather), and it's felt more like anthropology than fantasy.  Less escapist somehow.  On the other hand, I guess it wouldn't be hard to play it like Ganakagok either, resolving giant cataclysms.<br/><br/>This is one of those designs that I'd play Sim with one group and Narr with another group.<br/><br/>I was never clear on how much Brennan had a specific vision for how this "should" play, or wanted to leave it customizable.  I brought this up in a pretty detailed editing pass I did on an early 2009 draft, but that never turned into a discussion.  I'm guessing "customizable" but I haven't seen the final edition.<br/><br/>Jason, if you've got an eye toward later uses, I like these best:<br/><br/>OUTSIDERS<br/>Sunshine People<br/>Upside Down People<br/>I'd want both of these to "look fair and feel foul".<br/><br/>MONSTERS<br/>He Looks At His Tracks Again, collector of spirits of the recent dead<br/>One Who Cries, a monster who carries a rattle and weeps endlessly<br/>River Men, muddy dudes who abduct children in the canyon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281820/#Comment_281820" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T22:34:05+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 10:34PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2010 10:35PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>So which ones leap out at you as unbearably cool and fun?

I think I'll start compiling a list of cool monsters and names for the People, as a resource and inspiration. I realized that all this pre-play was not that useful, especially since, as a GM, I had no direct input into the village web's creation. This is a nice feature, actually - the GMs got to sit back and watch as the village took shape, with each choice the hero players made being a big flag concerning their interests and enthusiasms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281840/#Comment_281840" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T04:47:28+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  4:47AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see that list, Jason!

A weak Outside Chief always causes much drama.<br/><br/>David, I intended to leave it customizable. In my designs, I like to leave room for each group's individual taste. I've had games of HWCTLH that were crazy over-the-top supernatural, with flying witches riding clouds of owls, and others where all of the drama occurred between characters in the village and there was little if any supernatural influences. It all depends on where the groups' interest turns. The game naturally focuses on whatever the players are collectively interested in, due to the scene framing mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281844/#Comment_281844" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T05:15:26+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  5:15AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2010 5:20AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite NPC name from our game: She Jumps.

Cool.  My first instinct would be to address the supernatural/epic dial explicitly before playing with a new group, either agreeing on a dial setting or agreeing "we're open to anything; contribute as inspired and we'll see what happens!"<br/><br/>I know that in my editorial comments I was pushing, "Hey, is it epic or isn't it?" but I do love the idea of playing it on different scales with different groups.  Anyway, I hope some other portions of my lengthy notes were useful.  This is a game that I'm definitely psyched to play again ASAP!<br/><br/>Jason, in HWCTLH, I'm pretty sure Mixalot-level artistry befits the social skills of a high-ranking female character.
