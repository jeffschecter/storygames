And they're a blast. With the kinks ironed out, they work well, and they're fun. They do what I designed them to do. Cool.<br/><br/>Here's the problem: due to geography, timing, and other issues, every time I play it's with a group that consists mostly of people playing for the first time. (The good part is, the different people playing is because many, many people are interested in the games, not because people never want to play twice, so that's very cool.) Why is this a problem? Well, these storytelling games, while working to focus the story, pretty much allow anyone to narrate freely, whatever they want (like a GM in an RPG). <br/><br/>It seems that people playing for the first time really enjoy that freedom and tend to get really wacky and out there. They're having fun, it's cool, and I would do the same thing if it was my first time. But <i>I</i> am getting really sick of it, because I've really gotten the "woo! let's make a story!" thing out of my system, and want to tell meaningful, powerful, coherent stories. I've gotten the same from some of the players: "OK, I see how this works now. I think I could make a really great story with this next time..." But they've all played once or twice. I've now been through many, many playtests and want some more depth.<br/><br/>Note: I'm 99% sure that the system is not creating the wackiness. The support for strong, meaningful stories is there; the players just aren't willing. <br/><br/>Is there a way I can keep first-timers from getting all silly with it, or is that spoiling their fun? Is there anything I can do that would help them get serious about it? Or am I the one with the problem? (Maybe I just need to be patient...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172435/#Comment_172435" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T15:08:24+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  3:08PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Note: I'm 99% sure that the system is not creating the wackiness.

It's not the freedom of the system.  It's not the newbie-ness of the players.  It's the player's commitment to the fiction.  Ron's games have really driven this home for me with their extensive biographies and attention to the content of the source literature.  Sorcerer &amp; Sword is intended to be played with people committed to creating awesome pulp fantasy.  Spione is intended to be played by people committed to political espionage fiction.<br/><br/>That's my advice.  Figure out what kind of story you're craving then go find fans of that kind of story.  Systems that then support that commitment will play themselves.  The commitment comes first, the system spins that commitment into something awesome.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172439/#Comment_172439" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T15:22:35+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  3:22PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reminds me of Ralph Mazza's comments that the first times playing Universalis, people new to the open nature of possibilities create wacky, everything-and-kitchen-sink situations, before settling down to "use their power wisely".<br/><br/>Problem is if they're always new, they never get past that to "okay, that was cool but lets settle into playing this game now".<br/><br/>From the Universalis context, social contract up front is part of it perhaps.  Agreeing, "this is a game about X, we are set here - we're pirates in a fantasy caribbean, no ninjas or cat girls from space and no one is ripping off Jack Sparrow, we're making our own story".  I've found that "what this is not" is often as important to define as "what it is".  This is a game about soldiers under the command of incompetent, uncaring officers, but it's not Blackadder Goes Fourth, these are not silly accent twits - first time someone pulls a silly accent that's two penalty dice.  Keep the jokes for the down time.  <br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172440/#Comment_172440" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T15:24:16+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  3:24PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the people playing these games are friends or acquaintances how are not gamers and have never played anything like this. It is possible that they are also showing up with the expectation of something silly and fun. In any case, I suspect an idea like "commitment to the fiction", or even the idea that a group of people can spontaneously improvise a great story (as opposed to a silly one) may be entirely foreign to them. One or two people I talked to were very enthusiastic about the game. I asked them, afterwards, "do you think this game has the potential to create a more serious, profound story?" The response I received was something like, "Oh.... well... hmmmm. Yeah, I suppose so." Then, a few moments later, "Hey! Oh, it definitely could. Wow! That's cool! I can really see the potential!" <br/><br/>Josh,<br/><br/>Yes, I think so. It has happened in each playtest, to varying degrees. I'm just getting more and more curious about the potential of the games to create deeper, darker, more tragic stories. The players, being new to the whole thing, and also not close friends with each other, I think, get a little nervous. Creating in public is a very personal, revealing thing, so I think that for many people a default behaviour is to hide behind humour.<br/><br/>Jesse,<br/><br/>My games are genre-universal. How might I go in finding and/or encouraging players to commit to the fiction? (I think you're right on, by the way.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172442/#Comment_172442" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T15:27:25+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  3:27PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spike their diet Pepsi with Vicodin.<br/><br/>Be a stronger GM.

Once everyone understands what you (as one of the players, or as the "playtest coordinator") are looking for, they can play in that direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk%20Remmecke" title="Dirk Remmecke"><img alt="Dirk Remmecke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk%20Remmecke">Dirk Remmecke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172531/#Comment_172531" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T04:40:55+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul T.,<br/><br/>I observed something similar but I am not sure if that's what has happened to you. Maybe the symptoms are the same, but there are different motivations at work.<br/><br/>This kind of players "going wacky" or "going over the edge" happened to me only in <b>one-shot games</b> - but then in more than 50% of sessions. It happened with trad games and story games, in RPGA tournament sessions, in convention games (random groups all the time). It even happened in sessions that were meant as a "breeze of fresh air", a one-shot diversion from a long running campaign. When the regular campaign resumed a week later everyone was back to normal.<br/><br/>There is something in casual, no obligations sessions that seems to invite this behaviour in gamers (or a certain type of gamers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172552/#Comment_172552" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T06:36:45+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  6:36AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run InSpectres a lot with novices to the indie gaming form (and reasonably often with novices to roleplaying more generally), and that coupled with the silliness of the concept of InSpectres has led to some very very silly games indeed.

Unless they're actors, or DJs, or Kareoke singers...probably not very often.  And even if they are comfortable with THOSE displays...because they believe they're good at it...that doesn't necessarily mean they'll be comfortable with the sorts of display an RPG requires.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a reverse example.  I have no problem sitting down with group of people I only kinda sorta know and roleplaying...I'm good at it, I'm comfortable with it.  But you won' t catch me dead on a Kareoke stage...nuh-uh, no way...welllllll, maaayyyybeee...if I was really drunk and a bunch of us were up there just screwing around and being silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts easier to be silly.  People tell jokes all the time, they want others to laugh at the things they say.  People also know that not all jokes are winners...sometimes they fall flat.  So what that means is simply this.  When your creativity is on display and being judged...and you're not sure you're any good with the activity in question...the safest place to be is silly-land.  Going dramatic and having people laugh or think its not good, hurts.  Being silly and having people laugh is the point...and even if it doesn't work, it doesn't hurt nearly as much because you weren't really trying, you were just being silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how to fix that.  Well, any technique that enhances people's level of comfort with their fellow players will help.  If you've got one guy in a group that everyone knows just loves to mock people...that's going to make everyone less likely to risk judgement.  After that time and familiarity are the best solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Jesse's also right.  People are going to be more motivated to get better at an activity if their committed to what the activity represents.  Give them something that's really important to them (like Ron's love affair with classic pulp sword and sorcery...or spy fiction) and they'll try harder because they want to do justice to something they love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172648/#Comment_172648" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T12:32:43+00:00" title="October  2, 2008 12:32PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2008 12:41PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would I be crushing toes (specifically Jesse and Ralph's) if I were to re-emphasize the point about commitment to fiction a few centimeters and suggest that, in my view, it's not about commitment to "re-creating" a genre, but to committing to fiction itself -- which means asking the players to put on the line something they actually care about?<br><br>The rules of a fictional setting matter -- YES!

Things are getting a little too intense." <br/><br/>I'm going to play again on Sunday, and I'm wondering what I should do. I'll definitely sit and chat with the participants for a little while at the beginning. If they're up for something more serious, I'll ask everyone to try to remind each other. <br/><br/>One thing working in my favour is that the system I'm using tends to bring out interesting moral judgements about characters, even despite all the silliness. I might add a note to players to make sure they create characters with sympathetic motivations (good or bad, make sure it's something you can sympathize with or relate to). That seems to help. Hmmm. That's an interesting observation for me, actually: when I liked the characters, it didn't matter whether the game was silly or serious--it was moving regardless. I don't care how serious the game is, so long as I can relate to the motivations of the characters. I'll try saying something about that Sunday and see how it goes.<br/><br/>If you have more advice, please post it in the next 48 hours!

That is not something you, or any game, or any technique, can accomplish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173606/#Comment_173606" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T14:41:34+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  2:41PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For anyone curious, I played the game again last night.

There were even some parts that, if recounted, would sound really silly, but felt meaningful and interesting and not silly at all while we were engaged in them.<br/><br/>I don't think I did anything different, and the players were mostly strangers (although I knew them all).

But many of them (even the gamers among them) are simply not in tune with the idea that <i>we are going to participate in a process that has the potential to create a quality product</i>. They've never done that in a "game". They are expecting silly fun.<br/><br/>How can I communicate this to them better without sounding like some weird snobby elitist who really, really does not want you to join his game unless you're a cool, creative, inspired genius with impeccable taste?<br/><br/>Surely you've played some story games with non-gamers before. How can you communicate to them that it can be a fun and relaxed process, but they should still be looking towards high-quality story results? <br/><br/>(Note: this mainly has to do with distributed-authority games. In an RPG with a strong GM, they can, of course, just enforce their own vision.)<br/><br/>For example, my game begins with a brainstorming process, from which select elements are chosen by the group. Everyone has an equal say in this process--no one can "take charge"--this is governed by the mechanics. Those chosen elements will form the basic bits of the story, so the quality of the story is dependent on the careful selection of the elements by the players. But most players don't seem to get it the first time around: they're not used to the idea that the could be playing a game for two hours, and that it's fun depends on them making choices based on what they care about.<br/><br/>So, how can you communicate that they need to commit to the fiction if they want to have fun... without sounding like an arty-farty jerk?<br/><br/>Do you have positive or negative experiences to recount that relate to this?<br/><br/>I feel like just writing about has made a lot of crystallize in my head, but I'd like to hear about your experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174928/#Comment_174928" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T11:42:13+00:00" title="October 14, 2008 11:42AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>But most players don't seem to get it the first time around: they're not used to the idea that the could be playing a game for two hours, and that it's fun depends on them making choices based on what they care about.<br/><br/>So, how can you communicate that they need to commit to the fiction if they want to have fun... without sounding like an arty-farty jerk?</blockquote>\nIn the US, it's impossible.

It has happened in each playtest, to varying degrees. I'm just getting more and more curious about the potential of the games to create deeper, darker, more tragic stories. The players, being new to the whole thing, and also not close friends with each other, I think, get a little nervous. Creating in public is a very personal, revealing thing, so I think that for many people a default behaviour is to hide behind humour.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is probably your problem. Everyone who has roleplayed extensively with people from different gaming cultures know that in experienced gamers the expectatios of roleplaying can be deeply imprinted. Playing with new comers can often give you possibilities in play that are otherwise hard to get (or at least takes a long time of coordination of expectations). <br/><br/>But really, the most important thing is probably to have common expectations of the session at hand. From my own experience: when I'm went to a larp to play a computer programmer and sex-delinquent I prepared for that and you adjust to what you have to do. Then it's easy to say things you normally would have a problem to say "It was me. It was I who attacked her. She doesn't remember, but it was me." Bu then, if these kind of themes suddenly appearduring an night of ordinary dice-rolling rpg then I know I always try to sneak away from it. And I think this is the case for everyone.<br/><br/>If you want heavier, more meaningful stories I first of think you have to talk with the other players about a common agenda and second, as mentioned earlier in the thread, specify a theme of the specific game. I don't believe that you need huge amounts of source or texts, but it is a proven fact that rather small amounts of heavily geared text given to the players right before play will very much influence their style. I mean, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174934/#Comment_174934" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T12:18:34+00:00" title="October 14, 2008 12:18PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>Surely you've played some story games with non-gamers before.

But I do have some really good experiences in playing with non-gamers. In my experience they are often more open to the type of common contribution than seasoned gamers. <br/><br/>But Paul, you seem to be able to get quite a bit of players. Roleplaying is like sex, practice makes perfect, at least if you are enthusiastic about it. I think you should reuse players that you believe are more interested in your type of game. Here are two points I believe in:<br/><br/>*If possible, bring together people who don't know eachother from before.<br/>*Make an event out of it. Instead of just 'an rpg session', say "I have this thing I want to try. Are you guys willing? I think like this: *write smart stuff here*". If you make them commit to such an invitation I think you might be in quite a different place than otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174976/#Comment_174976" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T15:33:06+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  3:33PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>So, how can you communicate that they need to commit to the fiction if they want to have fun... without sounding like an arty-farty jerk?<br/></blockquote>\n"Hey guys/gals, I've got this new roleplaying game I'd like to try out.

And not be artsy-fartsy about it.<br/><br/>it helps if you can choose players with some buy-in to the notion of serious play, too. Humor is often a way to diffuse discomfort or shyness, so avoiding that helps also (i.e. play with folks who know and trust one another).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
