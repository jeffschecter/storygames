Could have been at another forum though...)<br/><br/>A bit of background: Here in Austria (Well, Vienna to be precise) there are a couple of gaming cons ever now and then, the biggest of which is currently undergoing a hefty redesign. (The last couple of years, it was more a Con for the local shops to sell their stuff, the guy running it got fed up with the other shops and so wants to do something new now.) I'm in no way part of the team or anything, but I like both the guy running it and the convention itself, so I've been thinking quite a bit about cool stuff that could be done there.<br/><br/>One thing that I've been thinking about was something like workshops or panels, and while thinking about panels and panel discussions and who would be nifty to have as a guest on those and I thought "Man, I'd love to see some indie designers at this con.". <br/><br/>And now I'm here. So, indie designers of SG, what would it take to convince you to hop over the pond (Or the canal. Or the various other european nations between you and Austria.) and come to a convention here? Pretty pleases? Formal invitations? Promises of comfy couches and local food? Payed hotel rooms? Flight tickets? Hookers and blow?<br/><br/>M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179765/#Comment_179765" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T12:25:14+00:00" title="November 22, 2008 12:25PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A ticket there, a ticket back, a place to sleep ( "on the floor in my living room" is acceptable), and two days notice.

The former would need to be approximated, but enough reliable data about the local conditions will allow me to do that myself. The latter is up to the convention organizers. Getting from here to Vienna and back seems to cost... 300-500 euros, including me travelling to the airport and flying to Vienna and back. So yeah, throw 300 euros and room&amp;board my way and I'm there. Anything less, and I'll have to start looking at the sales potential of the planned schedule.<br/><br/>I also lie very convincingly if you need lies to get grant money for this sort of stuff from cultural institutions.<br/><br/>In other words, please tell us more about the sort of business opportunities one might find in Austria. That influences the choices of most designers in this regard, I'd expect. For example, I'm pretty much game to go to Spiel Essen on my own expense if I can find anybody to share a booth with me, simply because I know enough of the grounds to be confident about my ability to cover most of the expense by selling stuff. The same's true of many Finnish conventions. Other places in Europe, not so much - don't know enough, don't have enough local connections to be confident of success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179769/#Comment_179769" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T13:13:09+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  1:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2008 1:19PM by Lord_Minx.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>A ticket there, a ticket back, a place to sleep ( "on the floor in my living room" is acceptable), and two days notice.

But then, if I had the money, I'd fly every second guy on SG over. ^_^\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>In other words, please tell us more about the sort of business opportunities one might find in Austria.

I have no idea how much money the various vendors made, as they sadly don't tell that to some random schmock like me.<br/><br/>That said, the organizers experiment with ordering a couple IPR games seems to have gone well enough that he keeps doing so, AFAIK, so there is a market for "games beyond the mainstream". Whether it's enough to get the travel costs back from sales at the con alone: I don't know. I suspect not or at least not completely, but like I said, I don't have any hard data here. <br/><br/>All of that assumes that things will work like they did the last years, of course. AFAIK the con is planned to be somewhere in summer or fall, so there's still much time for things to change. (The only certainly I have is that there will be a Brickwars Tournament. ^_^ )<br/><br/>EDIT: And just for the record: Designer or not, con or not, if anybody here wants to visit Vienna, there will always be a place in my apartment. Might be a camping bed, might be the livingroom floor (Or the couch as soon as we finally get one), but you're all welcome. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179782/#Comment_179782" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T15:17:00+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  3:17PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Train or flight tickets, I guess.

I'm not sure that I'm who you mean, though.</blockquote>Levi, if I had the money for tickets, I'd fly you over in a heartbeat. But then, if I had the money, I'd fly every second guy on SG over. ^_^<br/><br/>Back in my convention days, I was told that there are 'tiers' of guests. At one tier, you paid for just lodging (or provided a couch). Then at the next tier, you provided lodging and the plane ticket (never a bus or train ticket). At tiers beyond that, you actually paid the guest and/or catered to their prep list.<br/><br/>But that is for conventions in the continental US, where people might go on a circuit of conventions during the summer. For travel to a different continent, the lowest tier is problematic.<br/><br/>So get some plane ticket money from the organizers. Have you asked them? You never know unless you try. <br/><br/>Then contact particular designers and offer for them to be on the panel. But the organizers have to balance the cost of that against the number of people that this designer will draw to the con. If indie games are popular and will bring in a few hundred people, then they might go for it. <br/><br/>Otherwise, your best bet is to demo the games you like and try to build up some more interest for next year.<br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180425/#Comment_180425" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T06:54:17+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  6:54AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frederik J.
