The forces of Baator, including many mortals bewitched into infernal service, invaded the Astral Plane and sacked the Githyanki capital, and brutally executed their loathsome Lich-Queen.  The baatezu have declared that the Astral Plane will become a staging ground to spread order throughout the Transitive Planes and encircle the forces of Chaotic Evil.  Repulsed at the occupation, and furious at the treatment of their most respected artifacts, Githyanki insurgents conduct hit-and-run tactics on the backs of red dragons.<br/><br/>The invasion--and the subsequent savagery and looting--upset deep fissures in Gith society.  For generations the Githyanki had repressed and enslaved their near-kin the Githzerai.  With the Lich-Queen's finally over, the Githzerai are rebelling, hoping that others of their kind--who had established sanctuary in the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo--will soon come to their aid.  <br/><br/>Almost all of Gith culture in the Astral Plane is breaking down, either ruined by the Lich-Queen's inscrutable malice, the fury of the invasion, or the madness.  T'anarii from the Abyss have come to sow chaos and mistrust, and ensnare the infernal Baatzu in an geopolitical (plano-political?) mess.  Many disillusioned Gith, horrified at what's happened, believe this is all the machinations of their ancient foes the Illithids.<br/><br/>Play would alternate between three "parties" --<br/> <br/>A group of Halfling soldiers just awakening from the <i>geas</i> that led them on this mission.  They crew a lobster-shaped armored tank, an Apparatus of Kwalish.  These characters don't speak the language, and are many, many planes from Sigil (or the Prime, whatever).  The command structure of the coalition is complex, and includes a few Celestials who hope, somehow, to make Gith society more Good-aligned, even though the occupation also involves devils.<br/><br/>A group of Githyanki blackguards and dragon-riders, seeking to resurrect the Lich-Queen, expel the invaders, and establish a society more in keeping with the teachings of their Prophet, Gith.<br/><br/>A mixed-race family of Githyanki/Githzerai Commoners, who are caught in the middle of all this and must scrounge around for a means to survive, possibly escaping from the Citadel of the Lich-Queen and eventually making their way across the Astral for refuge somewhere else.<br/><br/>Each session involves one of these groups in reaction to whatever was just done by the other group in the previous session.<br/><br/>(I would apologize to the actual human beings involved in these tragic events if I knew anyone's name.  As it is, insensitive dimwittery is the nearest I can come to grappling with a mind-boggling situation.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68376/#Comment_68376" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T18:53:25+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  6:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2007 6:56PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like a pretty good idea.

Paranoia was published first during the height of the Reagan administration's froth-at-the-mouth twitching Cold War psychosis. Because it was funny, even right-wingers could enjoy it even as it stabbed their political position in the face. The US was funding death squads and selling missiles to psychotic religious fanatics, it was a deadly serious time and attitude, but Paranoia skewered it and so it was a-okay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68379/#Comment_68379" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T19:04:21+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  7:04PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Baatezu-Tanar'ri (bah, I can never spell them right) comparison is so apt it takes my breath away.

The old king had just been overthrown by Dragon-Blooded legions from the overseas Realm.  The resistance was led by a group of Solar Exalted insurgents.  The PCs, all recently awakened Solar Exalted, heard about this and headed off to see what they could do.  As soon as they arrived in the city, they walked slap-bang into a 'suicide bombing' attack in a marketplace (the release of a group of homocidal demons who had no thought of their own safety).  They traced the origin of the demons back to the insurgents, condemned them, secured a bunch of the 'bombs' to prevent their use, then got stuck into all the other blood opera fun that was going on in the city.  <br/><br/>By the end of the game, the PCs thought it was a good idea to set off one of the suicide bombs in a crowded public square, simply to cause a diversion.  <br/><br/>How's that for a thematic statement?  <br/><br/>(None of the players twigged that they were really in Baghdad.

While Sunnis and Shiias are more different and have a more divided past than Hutus and Tutsis, differences that are tiny from an outsider's view are very visible to those in the region and sometimes those differences can be all-consuming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Cerling" title="Adam Cerling"><img alt="Adam Cerling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.grapevinelarp.com/lantern.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Cerling">Adam Cerling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68420/#Comment_68420" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T07:40:25+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  7:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Dogs town once that was an allegory for the pre-war world situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the end of it, the PCs had led the town in invading the farmhouse of the abusive patriarch, killed him, repossessed all the farm's resources for the town, and left a Dog behind to govern for a while.

In a more Indie-ish game, it would entirely work as a blood opera between 3-4 players with various political, social, and religious affiliations shaking them out.  <br/><br/>Jon Hastings and I (and several others) tried this with a PTA game set in 1990's Serbia.  Everyone else played slightly escapist concepts: the student revolutionary, the gangster, the chief of secret police.  I played the civilian single mom.  I have conflicting feelings about that game: it was both a lot of fun, and also, the most heartbreaking and emotionally wrenching role-playing I've ever done.  Every time Jon said, "Okay, James, your scene: plot or character?"
