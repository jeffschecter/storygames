"Is X a story game?" is the worst.<br/><br/>I <em>totally</em> understand that different people want different things out of this site, and that for each person, the definition of story games is different. However, to ask either of the above questions is divisive and ridiculous. It will drive people away in a major way.<br/><br/>A long time ago in a galaxy far, oh so incredibly far away, I wrote a post called <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=4464.0" rel="nofollow">The Five Percent</a> on The Forge. It talked about the site having a goal, and five percent of people working against that goal with their own agenda. That thread was a precursor to what happened: that five percent grew and overtook the site, even infecting the leadership of the site.<br/><br/>I think Story Games has a goal: to promote having fun and telling great stories with role-playing games, and sharing that fun with each other. Or maybe it's to gather together an excited group of people with shared interests in role-playing games to talk about whatever. Either way, "What is a story game?" is a question that works directly against those goals.

And they come here and recently D&amp;D has kind of been dominating the threads. And then they wonder why it is that D&amp;D is dominating a place that they come to to talk about different games. Right or wrong on their part to ask the question? Eh, doesn't much matter to me, what matters to me more is the feelings that spawn the question.<br/><br/>Now, I'll quote Graham at these people (which includes me) and say, "you must be the change you wish to see in the world." Seriously. If I want story-games to talk about something other than D&amp;D, I should start up a thread about something other than D&amp;D (like maybe the one where I quote the advice section from Enforcers, a 1987 super-powers game, which I think is simply marvellous (the advice, not the game, the game is shite)).<br/><br/>EDIT: In case it isn't clear, I agree with you. Reading "D&amp;D isn't a story game" is about as amusing as reading "Capes isn't a roleplaying game." Very importantly, there is no Zen to be found in discussions that label a game as this or that. These discussions will not help bring the fun to people's games, they'll just sit there and take up space and get people irked and get them to argue and instead of a bunch of threads describing how awesome D&amp;D is, and how to make D&amp;D even more awesome (threads that are useless to me but I'm glad people are having fun with D&amp;D), we'll have that plus pointless debatey threads, which will probably infect other threads, either in mood or in content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152429/#Comment_152429" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T10:46:06+00:00" title="June 23, 2008 10:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton, I'm trying not to argue.<br/><br/>How about people who just try to find the definition of Story Games?

I am interested in calling something which is blue "Blue", I consider it to be of value.<br/><br/>Now, after that I say it's not a Story Game, why should it stop anyone, on this forum of all fora? I mean, we discuss board games, card games and such around here all the time.

Or maybe it's to gather <br/>&gt; together an excited group of people with shared interests in role-playing games to talk about whatever. Either way, "What is a story game?" is a question that works <br/>&gt; directly against those goals. Cut it out.<br/>&gt;<br/><br/><br/>Regarding chearns point on D&amp;D4 dominating threads,<br/>Question...<br/>Can any role-playing game NOT be a "story game"?<br/><br/>I've always been inclined to believe that its the people that sit down at the table that "make" the game experience whatever it will become, together as a shared co-creative environment.  I will allow that some games are predisposed to thinking about or playing in a certain vein, style, or way  BUT  I disagree strongly that any one game cannot be enjoyed only from one parameter.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed many of the D&amp;D4 threads because as a member of the role-playing (and Story Game) community it's not only the 500lb gorilla that has drawn my attention, not only because of D&amp;D's nostalgia, but also because its actually a darn good game!  I'm really impressed/intrigued with the want/attempts to take new next steps into the future of the hobby that 4e has shown.  This can be seen with all the various rules/discussions that are influenced by computer game media, all the way to showing a clear "indy game" influence with attempts at new twists on creating drama (with the Skill Challenges for example).<br/>To the point with this... I consider my group a great mix of "classic" style RPGaming and the more Story Game role driven style and we're having a blast bringing THOSE styles to the brand new D&amp;D4 campaign we've started.<br/><br/>We can discuss what words or phrases mean, and that's very very interesting but assuming that the reader community can't give/take from those "worst" discussion questions and use the feedback to improve their games isn't very community-minded and that makes me sad.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm happy to see when forums (like Story Games) allow for many different starting points from its users that all move toward a similar (if not exact same) goal...  One thing I would caution though - I am (relatively) new to this Story Games forum as are many people with every new day... with that, I would be inclined to believe that IF and WHEN someone posts your "worst" and "second worst" questions that it could HELP those people come to the level of understanding that you feel you have.  Apparently you've been around and heard many answers to these (and similiar) questions...  But what about the people that haven't?  Is it fair, right, or responsible of you as a member of the RPG-hobby community to stifle those conversations, those points of learning for others just because you've been involved longer?<br/><br/>You noted that you "totally understand that different people want different things out of this site",  but do you really understand that if you're criticizing the people that want to learn, understand and (eventually) add to the community and culture of Story Game, Role-playing Games or whatever you choose to call and define?<br/><br/><br/>This isn't meaning to be confrontational or argumentative, but it really confuses me why anyone that enjoys the hobby (from WHATEVER perspective) would want to disparage others looking to enjoy the hobby and community.  So much negative air is spread when constructive criticism (and general discussion) turns to elitism which is 100% why I have never liked the Forge, since its inception...  Comparatively, RPGnet has alot of fanboy conversation about games I never want to see, it has it's community favorites that come up ever three threads (*cough*exalted*cough*) but even still - for the most part I don't feel completely patronized if I ask a "stupid" question about a game or subject I'm familiar with as I always DID on the Forge.  <br/><br/>So in conclusion, I really like and appreciate the smaller like minded community such as this on Story Games primarily because (as a newer forum member) I haven't felt talked down to, nor have I felt apprehensive to ask a "stupid" question...<br/><br/><br/>Make sense?<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LukeS." title="LukeS."><img alt="LukeS." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LukeS.">LukeS.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152451/#Comment_152451" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T12:22:37+00:00" title="June 23, 2008 12:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is hilarious.

I mean, *I* don't think that conceptual discussions are divisive or pretentious, but many people do, and if this community were to become focused on philosophical discussions like "what do we mean by 'story-game?'", then it is quite likely that many people will be turned away.

It's about the way of playing the games, not the actual games.<br/><br/>But I would advise you to never, ever, use "story" in the name of an event where some rpgs are allowed and others not. There is almost nothing so flame-prone than discussions about what a "story" is. <br/><br/>Other flame-worthy words: Indie, role-playing, narrative, narrativist, simulationist, gamist, thematic, etc.<br/><br/>Yes, it's really difficult to be able to explain the difference between some game and others without using any of these.

They wanted to use the term story games as a banner. A banner for games that you can play at the drop of a hat, that share authority and produce great stories in a low-key social environment. They wanted "story games" to be the things that got played at meet-ups and con lounges.<br/><br/>Do you have a better term for just that? The thing that envelops Shock, Red Box Hack and Don't Rest Your Head?<br/><br/>We know that we don't want to call a game culture "indie", because that confuses the publishing approach. And besides, Unknown Armies and Tristat can both very easily fill that social niche described above, and they aren't indie. We want to have a title that can include those things.<br/><br/>Can story games have two meanings? One that is a tag for the kinds of things that get played at Go Play and Camp Nerdly events, and one that is an umbrella for all games where fiction is part of play? I think so. I think so especially because no one is stressing the need to differentiate those two meanings. Because the (broad) latter do get played at the former.<br/><br/>To me, "story games" means: Games where fiction influences mechanics and mechanics influence fiction, like Dogs in the Vineyard, Don't Rest Your Head, Covenant... and also, say, Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Arkham Horror.<br/><br/>I'd defend the idea of having a definition, and talking about what is a story game. I'd be most interested if the conversation went more like "is this an inner ring story game or an outer ring story game?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lemon" title="lemon"><img alt="lemon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lemon">lemon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152541/#Comment_152541" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T16:56:26+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  4:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys?

That game may be played with rulesets ranging from Shadowrun, D&amp;D4E, Dogs in the Vineyard, Don't Rest Your Head, ReCoil, Capes or Monopoly. What matters with a Story Game is the agenda at the table. <br/><br/>So the answer to the question of "What is a Story Game, reiterated, is this: "A Story Game is a game focused on the players creating a story together, rather than focused on specific characters or player roles, though these may still be strong components used in service of creating that story."<br/><br/>(In the next two examples, X refers to a published ruleset such as the above-mentioned. X does not refer to a game session.)<br/><br/>Further the answer to "Is X a Story Game?" will always be "Yes, if played with Story as the primary focus. These are techniques that I/We/You have used to make X more Storifically awesome (or quite good, if you're British)".<br/><br/>Furthest, no one may say "X is most decidedly NOT a story game." Rather, they can say it, but it can (and should?) be automatically discounted as disagreeing with the incredibly simple definition of a Story Game, because any value of X (to include Poker, Backgammon and Russian Roulette) MAY be played with Story as the primary focus.<br/><br/>Now maybe this leaves open the argument that Y instance of X (THIS D&amp;D Campaign, or THAT session of Capes) is a Story Game. I think it probably does. But in this, only the participants may make a definitive statement as to whether or not it was or was not a Story Game, because only they can determine what the focus was with any certainty. Posters here may make their opinions known in any languange ("That session didn't seem like a Story Game to me, in my non-official opionion" or "That campaign was not a Story Game, because you stated that no one cared about the story") and may offer advice on how to make it a Story Game if that is desired. Which falls within the stated intent as I understand it.<br/><br/>Or of course, this can be ignored. No skin off my nose. As someone said way up there, Once I have to wade through more BS (determined entirely subjectively by me, and without any concern for Story Gamism) than posts of worth, I'll stop reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152566/#Comment_152566" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T18:32:57+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  6:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And on the cool check in<br/>Center stage on the mike<br/>And we're puttin' it on wax<br/>It's the new style<br/><br/>Four and three and two and one <br/>And when I'm on the mike - the suckers run <br/>Down with Adrock and Mike D. and you ain't<br/>And I got more juice than Picasso got paint                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152568/#Comment_152568" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T19:06:33+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  7:06PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, it's hard to argue with the Beastie Boys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152576/#Comment_152576" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T20:10:46+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  8:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2008 8:14PM by misuba.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite><br/>But what about 10 years from now when something's newer than the RPGs formerly known as Story Games?

I just need to make sure I say, "Ugh.  That's one of those weird dirty hippie games, isn't it?  No way!  I play 1st edition AD&amp;D, like all <b>real</b> gamers." in the most disgusted, sneering tone of of voice possible, to convey the fact that the game that has been suggested is not even really a "game" at all, but some kind of activity that only snobby, liberal, anti-corporate, academic, literary elitists would play.  And probably Canadians.  Not real American Gaming Men like me!<br/><br/>And when someone says "Hey, I'm thinking of starting up a <i>4e</i> campaign, you want to play?"  I need to chuckle condescendingly and perhaps pat them on the shoulder as I say, "Oh, it's SO cute that you still play those retro role-playing games.

However, I still have to explain "what is a story game?" to other people, even gamers, and I need a coherent explanation.  For example, our local group has taken the initiative to set up "Story Game Lounges" at local gaming conventions, on the Go-Play model.  When I speak to convention organizers, gamers who haven't been exposed to story games, etc., I have to be able to tell them why this event should be run this way, rather than scheduling "Dogs in the Vineyard, Time block H, 2:00pm-6:30pm, Players: 2-6, Characters: Made at the table" in the convention program.  Having read discussions trying to describe what story games are is therefore useful to me.</blockquote>\nSo she's not setting up like an "exclusionary zone", more like an "introductory zone". After thinking about it for a while, you know what I would do?<br/><br/>I might call it a "Story Games" area or whatever, just for kicks, but I'd honestly introduce them as "<b>lesser-known RPGs</b>".<br/><br/>Lesser-known RPGs is a pretty inclusive term IMO.  You could throw down everything from Dogs in the Vineyard to RISUS to Roach to JAGS to Hardnova II, without having to contort and twist and think of the ways they're 'special' or 'different', and better yet without having to look like a person introducing them as 'special' or 'different'.<br/><br/>So, like, if I show up at Games on Demand ready to throw down Dread (TFBOP), With Great Power, RISUS and Dogs in the Vineyard, and someone else shows up with Iron Gauntlets, JAGS Have-Not and Faery's Tale, we can throw down in the same are with no problems, I think. There might be some hemming and hawwing over whether I (being someone showing up to a play area) want to play Dogs in the Vineyard or JAGS (cause they're two quite different games), but probably not any more pronounced then showing up to a general play area and hemming and hawwing over whether I want to play Traveller or Vampire: The Dark Ages (cause they're two quite different games).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152711/#Comment_152711" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T10:49:05+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 10:49AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I generally just go with "small press games" (not the lack of capitol letters and jargon) for Anemone's purposes.

                 I like storyjamming as a way of describing how one might tweak or approach a traditional game to take it away from solo-characters-verus-GM-oriented to team-story-help-the-poor-GM oriented play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should probably spell it as two words, but when I do that, it looks like a type of deviant behavior or an insult. "Go story jam yourself," for instance.<br/>\nStoryjamming looks better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I still need a term for the type of rules set I'm looking for. Scott Dunphy suggested Plot Arc game or Plot Arc RPG for things like With Great Power and Prime Time Adventures, which is very close to what I'm looking for right now. He uses Collaborative Narration to describe games like Universalis and Pantheon and Baron Munchausen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forget what he uses to describe Dogs in the Vineyard and Spirit of the Century, but I'd class them in a similar category to Ars Magica or D&amp;D 4e. (May I point out here that I like Ars Magica and D&amp;D 4e? But not as methods of team-oriented-story-play. Badass-Avatar-Interaction is what I'm looking for in a D&amp;D 4e showdown, boyeee.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn you and your Beastie Boys reference.

The term "story games" is specifically an inclusive term, stemming from a bunch of RPGnet arguments about how ______ game was not a role-playing game, and thus shouldn't be discussed on RPGnet.

I found the Codex, liked that definition, and decided to use it to build a local community of players that want to play games with mechanics that are about creating story together in their RPGs. I'm not using the term to poke anyone in the eye. What exactly is wrong with having a name that covers a category of games? How do I coherently say, "This group is about getting together to play this style of game," when apparently making any attempt at categorization is "divisive"? <br/><br/>I don't "want there to be things that aren't really story games". I want to be able to explain my group's purpose in less than a page.<br/><br/>Ben, I think you and Clinton are applying the wrong lessons from the past. I agree that it's a terrible idea to beat up on each others' games here - that's not the point. As the number of these Indie/Story/Hippie games grows and awareness of them grows among gamers across the country, people need to organize and explain themselves to local groups; not with the intent of having an Internet argument, but for the purpose of playing these games together. <br/><br/>So no "Story Games Lounge", no local Story Games groups, no capitalized story games category? Look, I'm not a hippie. I don't hate "labels" just because they're labels. I think labels are useful. I've been running games at conventions and organizing local RPG groups for years. I think these games need their own category and "Story Games" works well. But are you saying we should jetison that term for that purpose because that's not what it was originally intended for? I've been on this site for almost a year and this is the first time I've heard the history of the term. <br/><br/>Furthermore, people are coming to this site looking for information on a particular breed of games. This is where the people who wrote those games can be found and where people can find advice on running and playing those games. So if this site is going to spurn that identity, then I would submit that there is a legitimate, non-flamy, need for a site to promote the play of these games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153526/#Comment_153526" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T07:12:15+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  7:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>He uses Collaborative Narration to describe games like Universalis and Pantheon and Baron Munchausen.</blockquote>\nActually I'm leaning towards "Narration Interference Engine" becuase it's a bit more accurate and sounds a lot cooler.
