I'm doing this because no matter how we do our playing it in this hobby  it all about having exciting adventures. Since this is the internet I know people are going to have things to say, which is cool .  Personally,  I'm love to know one of the two things, but feel free to tell me anything else you want.  <br/><br/>1. How accessible did you find any given idea as either a GM or player. Could you see yourself playing or running that setting<br/>2.  what are some of the faults in the way any idea is written up.  Some of my ideas seem to be too broad or not clear enough in their first drafts .  I'm going to try and change that before posting them, but I need to hear what other people think  <br/><br/>So after this introduction will be the setting, so hopefully you will find things that will at the very amuse you.  I thank you for your time <br/><br/>Nick                    </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nick3.0" title="nick3.0"><img alt="nick3.0" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nick3.0">nick3.0</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385988/#Comment_385988" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T14:23:52+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  2:23PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figure I post best 5 today to see how what everyone thinks .   Here now are the "Ruin  Runners" ,  " Stargazers" ,  " Bone Pickers" ,  "Into Blackest Night"  and " The Hungry Void" <br/><br/>1.Into Blackest Night <br/>Description:  By the end of the 21th century humanity was feeling fairly comfortable.  There was of course friction between the various factions  that compose the various planetary and inter-planetary entities in the solar system . However, the bad old days of endless sniping over resources ideals, and  prestige where seemly far behind humanity.  Nothing embody this hope more then the launching of the first of the multi generation exploration ship.  Named the Huginn by it\u2019s Norwegian sponsor multi-billionaire Fabian Gerdt . It represented humanity first trip into the wider cosmos.    Generations of research with radio telescopes and the like had cooled the hopes of contacting other intelligent life in nearby space . However, at the very least it was felt that it was time for mankind to venture out into the cosmos and see what out there.  To perhaps even find an earthlike planet and begin the process of making it habitable for human life. <br/>\tSo 50,000 brave souls, and the genetic samples of millions began the voyage . Those chosen to man the ship come from all corners of the system .  There are Martian born Muslims, and the descents of spaceship construction crews recruited from the poorer corners of the earth in the early decades of the 21th century.  They are scientists from the Pan-American Union and India lead Alliance for Space Development. They are from affluent backgrounds, and modest ones.  They either believe firmly in various deities or are strong skeptics about the same deities.     It a diverse group design to be a miniature version of society at the moment .  The question of course is can this society survived the long trip between stars.  Will it change for the better, or the worst ?    What will happen went the ship arrives in a brand new solar system? These questions remain to be answered <br/><br/>2.The Hungry void <br/>Description:   Went you give the void sacrifices under certain conjunctions it will reward you . You saw this for yourself for the first time went you where 8.  You with your peers watch as the chief navigator priest sacrifice ten captives from a smaller ship attacked by your ship.  Those lives where needed for your ship to escape a ship eater that was pursuing you .  This would be the first of many deaths you be would involve in, but these stayed with you and the others to this day.  Perhaps because it was the first time you saw the taking of  livee  need to sustain the lives of those on the ships .  Perhaps it because you notice the fear in the eyes of those sacrificed, and wonder for the first time how you react if you where in their place . Maybe you are sensitive enough to have notice the Void\u2019s excitement as it feed, and been sicken for days afterwards by it.    <br/>\tNow years later you and your peers have grown into the roles that where define by the day you first witnessed the sacrifice.  Those of you that came to see the act as right joined your ship\u2019s ruling hierarchy as soldiers , scientists and ship maintainers.   In addition to helping to raid ships for sacrifices and other need items, you defend the ship from threats . Because there are many being who would take the lives of your ship and it\u2019s people .  These threats range from bigger ships to beings too terrible to name<br/>Those that continued to question the necessary cruelties of the sacrifices and other actions have search for answers through secret societies. A few may go farther and leave the ship to find answers on alien worlds and with mysterious groups like the Fate Weavers and the Trinity Incarnate.   The end for them is unknown, but there are whispers of entites with the names like the Locust Crusade and the Terrible Doctor waiting for new followers.  Most dismiss this as propaganda, but there enough stories to inspire some concern. <br/>\tThose of your peers that are sensitive to the invisible universe may or may not go either way like their peers . However, their actions may have even more weight, because their talent sets them apart from their peers.  In time they could became navigator priests or the high level tacticians that the ship needs to survive.  They may also become masters or slaves of the great beasts that live in the holes that crisscross space and time.   .   <br/>  ( Credit to Jamie/marhault for getting me started on the idea) <br/><br/>3.The Ruin Runners <br/>Description: The good news is there is no monsters hiding in these ruins , and there is plenty of treasure for the taking.  The problem is the reason is the ruins has very active defense system, and the people you are working with are not your friends in the slightest.  You may end up wishing that the monster was there to rip your throat out, because at least then you know it coming. <br/><br/>4.Bone Picker<br/>Description:  You  are serving your prison sentence in the Boneyard an ancient graveyard of monsters and beings from ages past .   The arrangement is quite simple.  You work daily and hard to harvest various bits and pieces , and you get to eat.  If you don\u2019t well the guards are not going to feed you .   Most of your   fellow inmates don\u2019t know why the government is so intent on gathering old bones and bits of metal.  You and a few people are starting to understand why though.    The bits and pieces of bone and metal have real power in them.  The sort  of power that may allow you to escape your sentence and be better off then when you started . It may also kill and consume your soul . <br/><br/>5.21.\tStar gazers <br/>Description: Your people have drawn their mystical power from the cycles of movement that occur in the sky for ages.   Now however, for the first time a small group is saying it possible to effect these cycles by placing a man made star in the sky .  This group claim that with this man made star that your people will no longer be shackle to the movement of the stars as they once where.  A few rather breathlessly speak of a day went the sky could be filled with man made stars that could be configured to ensure endless days of healing and good fortune. <br/>\t There is opposition to this by those who see the change as being a rather reckless meddling with the carefully created charts of heavens.  They stress that it has taken generations to match the stars to specific effects.  A man made star could simply alter the cycles of the stars in a way that could make these careful create charts less useful .  <br/>\tOf course a few from this side speak of the matter in terms as strong as the other side.  They claim that this man made star could possibly change thing so thoroughly that all of the charts would be worthless .  Most people regard them like the breathless element of the other side as being a bit extreme .  Still the question of what may happen is occupying all portions of your society in one way or another  .  You and your friends as students of your people\u2019s mystical arts are especially interest in this development.  For the moment you watching and listening to the talk among your fellow students.  You may well take a side in the end though.  <br/><br/>Thanks for reading<br/>Nick<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nick3.0" title="nick3.0"><img alt="nick3.0" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nick3.0">nick3.0</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386387/#Comment_386387" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T21:16:20+00:00" title="August  4, 2012  9:16PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2012 9:51PM by nick3.0.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right ,sorry been a bit busy/sick the last few days ,but now that I have internet at home this so go a bit qucker .  Here  are the next five .   The titles are the  " War of Winter" ,  "The Great Game" , The Mandate of State, The Mandate of Heaven",  " The War of the Rats" and the Tourist Bureau"<br/><br/>6.The War of the rats<br/>Description:  The city had been claimed by outsiders for the first time in ages .It defenders where imprison or dead , and the government broken. It was an unkind ending for a city that once held millions and was known as being at the very least as a place of power and wealth.  However, as the victors spend there first night in the city , there where  reports of strange lights and noises .  In the morning many found on walls close to their encampments the sentence, \u201cWhat the soldiers could not do, the rats will\u201d.   The next night the killings start.    <br/>\tSoon panic began to set in among the invaders.  Someone or something had decide to fight their presence in the city. It do not challenge them directly but struck at them from the shadows.   It pushed statues off ancient building, and poisoned water sources.  Patrols sent out to deal with the scourge would just vanish to be found dead the next evening their bodies mutilated like they had been attack by 100\u2019s of small animals.  By the end of the first months scores of the invaders had been either killed or wounded.  <br/>\tMost of the invaders assumed it was some sort of magical or physical assault being done by some of the residents of the city.  The cry quickly arose to make them regret this decision, but a few key people where more clearhead.   The city was ancient and had secrets stretching back ages, so it likely that most of the people would have no connection to these secrets.  Therefore their deaths would serve no purpose except to create further chaos.  However, while killing them would not likely stop the violence against them the threat of violence against specific people could possibly work wonders. So the invaders went looking for men and woman with knowledge of the city and families.  It did not matter if they where scholars in the city\u2019s ancient libraries  or thieves that once roam the cities ancient and rotting old quarters.   All of them where brought in front of the heads of invaders and offered a simple deal .  Work together and find the answer to the mystery of who was killing the invaders.   At the end them and their families would be rewarded.  However, to ensure progress and their loyalty their families will be held hostage , and should they have reason to be executed they will be without hesitant.        <br/><br/>7The Tourist Bureau <br/>Description: They have been coming and going since humanity had enough intelligence to know fire was useful. Some posses individual humans to do private projects and discard them uncaring went the work is done.  Others form cults and other groups to do their work and cause even more chaos in the process.  Some even directly manifest themselves, a process that affects reality in ways ranging from the interesting to cat   .  All are virtually unkillable, and can live forever.    On the face of it, most people would probably conclude at first glance that humanity would better not knowing that they where on the bottom of the sapient food chain.  <br/> <br/>     You know though that there are things humanity can do to protect itself, and maybe even thrive.  The first thing you know that the mass of entities known in your circle as Tourists, do what they do here because it affects their realms.  As you been told many times before \u201c As above, so below.So below, as above\u201d.   This means that while it next to impossible to physically hurt them, you can blackmail them by threatening their earthbound projects.  There are of course risks to this, as the Tourists will use any means they can to get there way.  However, most Tourists are not strong enough in the native realm to deal with the distribution of a project\u2019s timetable. So while it next to impossible to kill the seemingly endless number of Tourists that identify themselves as demons from any number of earthly mythologies ,  the bureau can make sure that their projects never get off the ground .   <br/> <br/>    Also aiding humanity is the fact that while it maybe one of the   weakest forms of  intelligent life in the universe it was not completely incapable. Over generations various cabals have learned various tricks of which the Tourist Bureau has gathered and codified.   These tricks ranging from banishment of low level Tourists from hijacked bodies to looping a process where the Tourist is forced to relive an unfavorable moment over and over again. Finally, the Tourists themselves provide support in exchange for allowed  certain  \u201cbenign\u201d projects .  The support called \u201cJuice\u201d allows the bureau to rewrite reality to ensure the world <br/> <br/>   Are things still quite  complicated for humanity?    Without a doubt that is the nicest way to put it . The  Tourists work ever angle they can to make sure they benfit first and foremost.  Those not in the mood to work diplomatic channels seem to find more then enough cannon fodder to make everyone life miserable if don\u2019t want to warp reality .  Of course management is not often as supportive as it should be.  However, while things are difficult they are not impossible, so keep smiling and remember we are not helpless . <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nick3.0" title="nick3.0"><img alt="nick3.0" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nick3.0">nick3.0</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386389/#Comment_386389" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T21:50:41+00:00" title="August  4, 2012  9:50PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            8.The War of Winter.   <br/>Description : In ages past went humanity had yet to come into existence two priests of a race long dead sat down to see the future to come.   In a few short minutes they learn three horrifying things. The first was there was to going to be a conflict would consume the whole of their civilization.  The second was the conflict would be about how the civilization will face it coming end.  The third was should there race not make peace with this fact the sacred cycle of life and rebirth would effected forever.  <br/>\t The first of the Priests regard this knowledge of the coming extinction with horror and vowed to fight against all that was coming, the sacred cycle be damm. The Second spoke about preparing the species for what was coming in order to preserve the cycle of change.   They quickly came to blows and nearly killed each other on the  sacred ground.  They both lived though, and now 50 years before the end of their world they both lead armies to fight each other.   There is no compromise on this, not finding middle ground. There is only one side or the other.   <br/><br/>9.The Great Game <br/>Description:  The world was tired from the global war went the remnants of special observer operations in the rival power blocks announced not only peace but a new government.   A government who power would be builds on the ability of both factions to forecast future outcomes using advance techniques.  <br/>\tThe result of this was some outrage and fear stroke by those factions in former governments who did not want to lose their power. For most of the world however the new rulers was an improvement though over the old one.  They restored civil services, made the streets safe, and generally improved the quality of life. However, not everyone with a grievance had ties to  the former regimes that once ruled the world .  These people ranging from second generation members of anti-prognostication groups to those who families where imprisoned as potential risks due to their connection with the old regime.    <br/>\tIt from this pool the old surving masters of the world draw the people needed for what called the Great Game.  The Great Game at it heart is a strategy design to exploit the fact that while the new world government could predict the future it required data to do so. So it possible to provided ways for people to address their grievances underneath the nose of the current government.  However, a great deal of self determination is required in order to make the support work.   So the conspiracy behind the Great Game looks very careful for the people to support. One of their subjects is you and others like you.  Maybe your concerns are abstract fears about a future where outcomes are known. Maybe you lost someone to the new world government purges.  Whatever it is you are really to fight and strike back.  However, how far are you willing to go, and who are you willing to trust?  Because this is a shadow land where seeming enemies could be friends and your dearest friends could be your enemies. <br/> <br/>10.The Mandate of the State , The mandate of Heaven<br/>Description: Those who wise to become immortal have for ages pursued this path through singular action.  They perfected themselves through quests and meditation or with research into medicine and the body.  At the end these few render themselves neither living nor dead, but to quote a famous poet,\u201cas endless as the light from the heavens above\u201d.  This is a path that takes much sacrifice, and suffering, but, those that know of it or pursue it say it that  this was simply  Mandate of Heaven on the act of becoming immortal. It can be yours they said, but you must be willing to give up things in return.    <br/>\tHowever, a man known as the Iron Emperor of the hundred states was determined to have both immortality and his temporal power.  The man as fearsome in this task as he was in his unification of the hundred states set to work gathering the knowledge and material he needs .    His men bribed or bullied nomad tribes for their knowledge of the affairs of the hidden and heavenly world. Some go so far as to steal artifacts and objects from the nomads that they think will help their lord. Closer to home scholars, holy men and mystics where offered a simple choice.   Enjoy the privilege of the unified kingdom physical and intellectual resources or become examples for those that disobey.    Most choose the resources but a few choose not to act on behalf of the state. Those that choose to disobey ar often force to dig their own graves and then be buried alive in them.  <br/>\tIt in this world of absolute state power resistance has  began to gather in the corner to the Iron Empire . Those scholars, holy men and mystics who where nether impress or cowered by the Emperor power has begun to organize secret societies to take on his control .  A few from the nomad tribes has travel to the empire to either retrieve stolen property or avenge slights. Some seeking immortality seek to kill the man who seeks to both temporal and immortal power.   Afterall, what make a person more of a legend then that slaying of the man who would defy Heaven\u2019s will. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
