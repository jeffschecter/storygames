Right now the changes are :<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 minor name changes : "weird" becomes "other", "barter" becomes "budget", "surplus" becomes "giri" or "asset", "gig" becomes "objectives", "gang" becomes "unit", "disease" becomes "taint", "followers" becomes "contacts", "augury" becomes "breach", "insight" becomes "intel" and I let go of hungry and famine for now but might find something more appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022\xa0the Shock countdown : works exactly like the Harm countdown but for psychological damage. Shock is a tag that things or actions have, and work like harm, except it's always area (everybody who see it takes shock). Stability works like armor for your mind. Has anyone come across a better way to handle mental breakdown in AW?<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 added some tags : mech (works like gangs- err, units with size and all but you have to pilot it instead of giving it order), behemoth (a size tag bigger than large)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I've done the Ashcroft Advisor (see above), and I'm polishing up the Major and the Engel pilot. My goal is to map everything 1:1 if possible and change only fluff if I can. So far the Advisor is exactly 1:1 the Hocus, the Major is more or less the Hardholder (had to change an option here and there) and the Engel pilot is the Driver with a big Eva instead of a bunch of cars (I had to retool the vehicle rules a bit).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll post them here as soon as they're done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts, reactions, ideas, corrections, insults ?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324553/#Comment_324553" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T06:01:56+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  6:01AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sheet looks awesome, but although the CT book always llooked good I don't have the it because I heard that same rumor about the rules being crap.

There also the fact that contrary to the Driver who changes rides, the Fifth Engel as one and only one Engel - having the *option* of piloting another one or even a replacement is a special Move.<br><br>I decided I'd ditch the weaknesses to swap them for gang cues (savage, unruly and the like) to represent the fact that the Engel is alive, Taking "unruly" for example is a big thing : it means the Engel is now a full NPC listed as a thread and all. Same as savage : when the MC can make a move, he can describe the Engel ditching free from your hand and EATING THE ABOMINATION YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING (and deal shock as well).<br><br>But all these are in beta, of course, and any suggestions are a plus.

For instance, in the C-Tech rulebook:<br/>\n<br/>\n"ARCHETYPES<br/>\n(...)by helping steer Characters into familiar roles, and creating supporting cast that fit many other roles, you'll be one step closer to that anime feel."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe playbooks are big archetypes that suit a C-Tech sort of story when twisted accordingly. Oh, and<br/>\n<br/>\n"HOPE VS. HOPELESSNESS<br/>\n(...)from the anime side of the equation, you have the constant influence of hope, and from the eldritch horror side you have the eventual understanding that there is no hope."<br/>\n<br/>\nScarcity and despair, but still, the PC can make a hell of a difference by the rules of AW. Check. Or<br/>\n<br/>\n"SOAP OPERA<br/>\n(...)All kind of crazy soap operas occur in anime and your game should not be different"<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's just an abstract version of "create PC-NPC-PC triangle" in a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the rules are a perfect fit for the background, so just a reskin was enough for me. But still, hacking the Tager or the Engel was fun! So yeah, I'll probably do a hack, because it's fun, but I'd rather play now, because it's more fun. So when I'm done with my first AW campaign and we've had our fun with the C-Tech reskin, I'll do one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325429/#Comment_325429" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T00:45:46+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 12:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting! I totally disagree, although I think it's still better than the game's existing rules. Maybe we're just seeing different things in the source material, though!

I also refocused the character's playbooks to match the whole "your character is unique" schtick AW has. Hence, the tager is (supposedly) the last one, the Engel is the last of the first generation, the arcanotech is the next Ashcroft, etc. But I didn't feel I had to change the whole thing. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must insist that the prettiness of the sheets are only about 20% my doing. Skyller's ctech sheets are great and I, hum, "borrowed" a lot, the same with the C-tech art and art directions, both spot on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325490/#Comment_325490" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T10:30:09+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 10:30AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the C-tech book which looks great but I have always struggled trying to get into how you would play it.<br/>\nYour hack looks stunning and has inspired me to try again.
