Of the various storytelling structures, television seems the most accessible and easy to convey. Most one-hour dramas have four acts with an optional teaser and/or tag. The act breaks typically follow the commercial breaks and this structure can handle anything from purely episodic (one-shot stories) to a serial narrative. That and there's a lot of games that center around role-playing in TV show universes, so emulating that structure from the ground up seems like a benefit.</blockquote>\nHappy to chat about it, but not sure what you guys were after.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426731/#Comment_426731" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T21:17:30+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  9:17PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2014 11:23PM by liblarva.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll start off by throwing a few useful links up for the basics.<br/><br/><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActBreak" rel="nofollow">TVTropes: Act Break</a>. Not quite right on the rising action / climax positioning, but that's an older model.

Some more basics of TV scripting.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.movieoutline.com/articles/television-script-format.html" rel="nofollow">Movie Outline on TV script formatting and structure</a>.<br/><br/>Most one-hour dramas are written in four acts, with an optional teaser and tag. It's Four Acts. There are Four Lights! You may think you see six, or have heard about three, but there are Four Acts. Each act ends on something of a cliffhanger. Long lost heir, end of an act. He's not our guy, end of an act. The monster chasing us for the whole episode is really a brunt up time-shadow of a possible future you, end of an act. <br/><br/>They breakdown like this:<br/><br/>Teaser: that grabby, hooky bit of action before the opening credits. Law &amp; Order they find a body. Star Trek a spatial anomaly. Doctor Who the Doctor pops out of the TARDIS and discovers something interesting.<br/><br/>Act One: that initial bit of investigation and confusion. Law &amp; Order they search for clues and investigate, interview suspects. Star Trek they scan, have some weird happenings on the ship, Data says something about something being offline. Doctor Who the Doctor finds someone in trouble and his companion might be in jeopardy.<br/><br/>Act Two: the investigation is basically over and they know what's going on. One mystery leads into another. Confusion gives way to conflict and fighting. Law &amp; Order they discover the real killer (the first two are red herrings). Star Trek the Romulans decloak and Worf wants to blast 'em. Picard says no. Doctor Who the Doctor is running.<br/><br/>Act Three: the group refocuses and takes the fight to the baddies. No longer on the back foot, but still facing complications. Down notes and despair. End of the act things hit the low point. Law &amp; Order they switch from police procedural to legal drama. Star Trek there's a Romulan virus in the ship's computer, Troi says something emo. Doctor Who the Doctor nearly loses his companion and/or the villain says something clearly and irrevocably evil.<br/><br/>Act Four: the group is on the offensive. Over the course of the act all the baddies are dealt with, and by the end of the act all the problems are solved. Law &amp; Order despite the scumbag defense lawyer, Jack and his team have won the case (most nights). Star Trek the ship is saved by technobabble and Riker's Beard. Doctor Who the Doctor, pick one: asspull cleverness, deus ex machina, or the power of love.<br/><br/>Tag: the moral or the quip at the end, laugh, and ride into the sunset. Law &amp; Order someone makes a remark about the case, they laugh (or don't), and walk down the hall or get on the elevator. Star Trek everyone beams up, they meet in the conference room, or Picard stares out his office window. Doctor Who the Doctor looks ecstatic or morose, cheers up at the end and grinding wheezes away.<br/><br/>Acts one and two are generally more passive, the characters are reacting. Acts three and four are generally more active, the characters are pushing back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426734/#Comment_426734" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T21:37:34+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  9:37PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2014 2:01AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thread-splitting isn't a no-no!  It's usually encouraged.<br/><br/>That 4-act breakdown is nicely coherent, thanks, now I know what you're after.  My big question is, how do you take a structure composed largely of protagonist action and then reproduce it in a game where the players are free to use their protagonists as they will?<br/><br/>Here are some solutions I've encountered:<br/><br/>I've played a few games that have set steps of a dramatic arc that's going on around the characters, informing what they do without mandating exactly what they must be doing.  In <a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a>, the characters' castle is besieged in phases, and you play out who's doing what at each phase.  The aim is to address the characters' personal issues rather the the siege itself, but the siege provides the pressure cooker for them to do this.  <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/grey-ranks/" rel="nofollow">Grey Ranks</a> works similarly, but with a larger number of steps, preceded by radio announcements of what's going on in the larger world of 1944 Warsaw.  I can talk more about these games if you like.<br/><br/>Then there's the structure of <a href="http://adept-press.com/games-fantasy-horror/sorcerer/" rel="nofollow">Sorcerer</a>, which isn't hard-coded, but consists of an initial premise, the directive to end play once that premise is addressed, and various GM prep and improv techniques to help push things along toward a conclusion.  <br/><br/>Other games use mechanics to track progress and endgame conditions, like <a href="http://steampowerpublishing.com/dead-of-night/" rel="nofollow">Dead of Night</a>'s Tension Die, which goes up as players take action, and acts as a guideline for the GM re: which phase/act of horror movies to emulate.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a>, which I haven't played, seems to have a hard-coded general act structure which is then customized by the group.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong, <a href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">@DanMaruschak</a> )<br/><br/>Finally, there's the tried and true technique of GM railroading, where my quandary is irrelevant because players are <i>not</i> free to use their protagonists as they will.  Please note that I don't mean "railroading" in the socially dysfunctional sense -- I just mean play where the GM controls what goes on.  If the players are into that, it can be quite fun.<br/><br/>Also!  We had an interesting conversation on Story Games last February about a similar topic (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/405524" rel="nofollow">Help: Basic Formula for Story</a>), with one poster describing <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/408117#Comment_408117" rel="nofollow">how he used Dan Harmon's Story Circle when GMing</a>.  Might be fun to skim through.<br/><br/>Does any of this sound like it's in the direction you want to go in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426757/#Comment_426757" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T03:17:01+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  3:17AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a>, which I haven't played, seems to have a hard-coded general act structure which is then customized by the group.

In Storied Age the protagonist and antagonist are working through progress tracks that are broken into three chunks which makes people think of the Three Act Structure, but since the progress tracks of the players aren't synchronized the game as a whole doesn't have hard transition points into different "acts" (it's meant to be more novelistic, and is intentionally trying to steer away from TV and film techniques where harder transitions are more common).<br/><br/>What might be even more relevant to this topic, especially given the examples in the opening post, is my in-development game <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/08/24/getting-there-in-time-rev-0-4-0/" rel="nofollow">Getting There in Time</a>, which is a "Doctor Who with the serial numbers filed off" game that has a mechanic that references act structures. I think my first-to-second and second-to-third transitions are even pretty close to the ones <a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a> laid out (although I wasn't working from any formal screenwriting frameworks when I designed it, just what I know from cultural osmosis).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426772/#Comment_426772" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T07:51:51+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  7:51AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal thoughts: <b>drill it down</b>. Don't use the Act structure so rigidly, but ask yourself what plot mechanisms make the story run that way. Generalize the Acts, and figure out what the pattern is.<br/><br/>My first recommendation to look into: <b>beats</b>. In TV and movie-speak, a "beat" is a thing where stuff happens. I know, that's terribly vague. Here's an example of a beat in action...<br/><br/><i>When the protagonist <b>receives sudden news</b>, one of the following happens: it's a breakthrough in the case; there's a complication with the plan; something terrible just happened.</i><br/><br/>Now, wait a second. Doesn't that structure remind you of any games out there? ;-)<br/><br/>That's right; Apocalypse World <i>et al</i> are actually modeling the way that TV shows and movies work. (It's small wonder that Dungeon World has been called "Indiana Jones for D&amp;D"!) A "move" is a "beat"--it's a space where something happens. Beat propels into beat, like move cascades into move.<br/><br/>What controls the beats? The tempo of outside pressures. In *World games, that's Fronts. As more fronts come closer to an end, the way that beat propels into beat becomes more intense, because the stakes are higher.<br/><br/>So, followup question, after that blazing commentary on existing systems: in the outline that <a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a> posted, what's the unified pattern of an Act as defined by the sources above? It seems to me they might all follow the same pattern; the only difference is the context with which that pattern repeats.<br/><br/>Is there a way to translate that into a more natural (less artificial) game rhythm?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426779/#Comment_426779" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T09:18:34+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  9:18AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2014 9:19AM by liblarva.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Housekeeping. Beat and scene are practically synonymous, but not quite. They're used interchangeably in all but a few corner cases. As above, a beat is a specific story event, something happens. <i>Jack confronts Jill about her affair</i>. That's a beat. A scene is one location. A single beat often happens at a single location, so beat = scene. But sometimes the beat moves from one location to another. If Jack confronts Jill about her affair at their house and the fight continues in their car that's one beat in two locations. But practically speaking, a beat and a scene are the same thing. <br/><br/>In general terms the acts are all the same. They open with a reaction to the scene that came before, and end with a cliffhanger, which propels the next act. They're slightly different thematically, act one being initial investigation, act two being confrontation with the problem, etc. The acts are made up of several scenes, while the teaser and tag are usually no more than one scene.<br/><br/>Starting from a fairly simple system that's close to this, Fiasco, we can extrapolate. In Fiasco there's no GM, each player in order takes a turn framing a scene starring their character. All the characters are tightly connected and there's plenty of interesting bits in place to draw from. Fiasco goes around the table twice, two starring scenes for each player, then has an act break (tilt). Play goes around the table twice more and you have the end (aftermath). Each act in Fiasco follows the same pattern, basically. A series of interconnected scenes that--hopefully--push the story forward, ending in a cliffhanger or twist. <br/><br/>You could easily have the GM set the first scene (teaser) to kick the story off. Play around the table once or twice and end on the GM again for the cliffhanger scene to kick the story into the next act. The cliffhanger scenes are natural break points for food and session ending as they're high tension, oh shit, what happens next moments. They're designed to bring the audience back through the commercial break. Play through the four acts till you get to the last scene of the fourth act, then end with a table-determined scene (tag).<br/><br/>This works for more GM-is-in-at-least-basic-control style games, and could easily delve into railroad-land. As long as the group knows there's only a loose story in place and to not venture too far afield, the story that emerges from play would be a lot more coherent, and likely interesting, than the accidental/boring story that comes out of pure sandbox or more traditional, D&amp;D style games. <br/><br/>Most scenes, especially the cliffhangers, will have rather obvious reactions from the characters. GM: There's a dead body. Players: We investigate. GM: You find definitive proof Suspect A is not the killer. Players: We investigate further. I think if the GM and players can separate the next generally logical thing to do, story-wise, from the next GM-enforced you must do X then you can have the best of both worlds. By that I mean that as long as the GM has a rough idea for the outline of the story--there's a murder, NPC A is the killer, okay go--instead of pixel bitching or having a very specific story in mind, then even this basic framework can get something like a coherent story going without venturing into railroading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426781/#Comment_426781" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T09:47:17+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  9:47AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My personal thoughts: <b>drill it down</b>.

Maybe once in a while, when the game starts feeling like it's just meandering, the group unfolds the "map"  and try to re-orient play to get back on track (the story).                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426782/#Comment_426782" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T09:51:40+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  9:51AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you can go a bit looser, actually. Powered by the Apocalypse games have the concept of the "hard move" that you slam players with, and there's a whole list of one. An act wouldn't have to end with any specific cliffhanger; the GM should be able to improvise a way to reveal new information in a shocking fashion. Have a list of possible "reveals", maybe, and then the GM takes notes on what's happening in the game and then uses that momentum.<br/><br/>Because I really like that idea of the momentum: the GM kicks it off with a teaser, then players take turns framing scenes. When enough scenes have been done (maybe use a meta-resource, like Fiasco dice?), the GM drops the curtain on the act by figuring out which reveal to drop into the scene. (An unexpected connection, for instance, or something sudden happening to a person. It'd be like having a Tilt event from Fiasco happen to close out the act.)<br/><br/>That keeps the rhythm (and cohesion) and ditches the railroading of the formula.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426796/#Comment_426796" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T14:07:50+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  2:07PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I see the difference between the two.

What is it you think of as different in your presentation that makes it less railroading?<br/><br/>After a quick reread, were you thinking the specific cliffhanger was something the GM would have prepared to use? Some of your text seems to suggest that. A GM could, especially if following some of the more formulaic genres like mystery, but that wasn't my intent with the structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426800/#Comment_426800" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T15:05:17+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  3:05PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, when I heard the term "railroady", my thoughts turned to "the GM had it all prepared and was driving the players to that point". The reason I don't think of a reveal/twist at the end of the Act as railroady is because it doesn't care where the players are; the GM would use whatever circumstances they'd arrived at to execute the curtain-drop. So, you go around the table, players play scenes, you all know that <b>something</b> is going to end the Act when you get to a certain point, but nobody knows what it'll be. (The GM, meanwhile, is figuring out what would be a good "bomb" to drop to end the act.) It's a bit like how in Fiasco, you'll have the table building things during Act 1, knowing that it'll end at a finite time. It doesn't force action, but I've noticed that we tend to be very aware of the impending end of the act.<br/><br/>This just adds the element of the "Act bomb", as you might call it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426801/#Comment_426801" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T15:08:32+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  3:08PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's the same thing as the cliffhanger I was talking about.<br/><br/>I was saying earlier that this structure could be used to railroad, not that it should.

I'd rather see a cliffhanger at the end of each act (i.e. turn around the table) than just once as the Tilt.<br/><br/>Some system to create different contexts for each act, so that the within-act routine can repeat itself while still progressing dramatically from act to act, might be good.<br/><br/>Perhaps these two could be combined?  At the end of Act One, the GM introduces a cliffhanger which ushers in the Act Two content that hadn't seen play until now -- wrapping up the initial mysteries, an antagonist appears, danger threatens, conflict begins.  At the end of Act Two, the GM wraps up loose threads and establishes where the bad guys are and what they're up to, so the players can plan their approach for Act Three.  The Act Three cliffhanger would then be the mother of all cliffhangers, with imminent death or loss staring the players in the face.<br/><br/>As far as counting acts by player turns, I think there are some pros and cons.  An agenda to reach a certain story point by a certain turn can help add focus and direction, but it can also be something of a burden on character play and organic surprise.  Total freedom, on the other hand, can lead to play that doesn't particularly build, making the act-end cliffhangers arrive more out of nowhere.  An in-between, such as act ends triggered by fictional events or player choices (like in Dead of Night), might be a nice balance between unconstrained fiction and fiction-independent rules.<br/><br/>Another thought: character moves with Act values.  If a player is tempted to use an Act 4 move in Act 1, they might wanna try another way; if a player does use an Act 4 move in Act 1, that might be a signal to the group to slow down a bit; if a player uses an Act 1 move in Act 3, that might be a sign to ramp things up; etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426818/#Comment_426818" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T18:41:21+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  6:41PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure that divvying things up into "Act 1 move", etc. is necessarily the best thing, because the acts are more about raising the stakes than doing specific things. And it feels a bit too "meta" for me, like "you need to stop using Act 1 moves because we're in Act 3". I still prefer the idea that external pressures make the story flow forward.<br/><br/>That's one thing that I think works in Fiasco: because an Act ends at a predetermined <i>time</i>, that influences how play builds. (Once, we built to a moment that made a great Act One capstone, and then used the rest of the scenes to flashback and build to it.) When you know that you don't need to build to a moment as the Act capstone, that frees you to just go forward.<br/><br/>So, each Act would consist of forward motion (like how Apocalypse World games propel from move to move), ending at a predetermined time. This means that the "Act bomb", as I'm starting to call it, slams hard against that forward motion, which seems about fitting for a cliffhanger--it's something unexpected that changes things. Up until that point, the Act has been moving dramatically forward, with some struggles but no real deviations from the plan. The cliffhanger drops that paradigm and makes something go wrong.<br/><br/>That make sense? So you're not trying to get the story to a specific point before the act ends; you're pushing the story forward, and when the Act ends, something drops no matter how far you got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426822/#Comment_426822" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T21:36:07+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  9:36PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say that AW moves propel a given character from one interesting situation to another.

Players or the GM can use these how they like to reinforce the general feel of the different acts without too many mechanics getting in the way. You may get a small bonus if you go along with the feel for the act, maybe a small penalty if you try to buck it, but definitely not locking things down tight. <br/><br/>The cliffhangers kick the story in a different direction from where it was, but they kick the story into the next act so you know generally where you're going. Act one is confusing and mysterious. Act two is filled with confrontation and conflict, etc. You can use that to write aspects for the act and figure out what cliffhangers would be good for your game and table for that adventure.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426824/#Comment_426824" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T01:03:31+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  1:03AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Tag: the moral or the quip at the end, laugh, and ride into the sunset.

Sure, Picard is often staring out his office window at the end of the fifth act, but it's also the same act where Riker's beard saves the day.<br/><br/>Sure, it's pedantic, but it hints at a big point:  TV shows use the act structure that works for them.  Some use four acts.  Some use five.  Some have a tag, and some don't.<br/><br/>In Star Trek, the fifth act gives the show more time to link the day-saving action to the philosophy behind it.  Whereas in Law &amp; Order, they want to wrap up the plot, and then have a separate scene where everyone stands around and comments on how justice was served (or wasn't, as the case may be).<br/><br/>So when you're adopting the formalized act structure of TV for your game, do so by thinking about what that particular game needs.

Trek did use Shakespeare's five-act structure with a teaser tacked to the front end. <a href="http://filmcrithulk.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/hulk-presents-the-myth-of-3-act-structure/" rel="nofollow">Five-act structure is wonderfully explained here</a>.<br/><br/>But when trying to explain a concept that people might not be familiar with it's easier to take the standard and detail that. The vast majority of one-hour dramas use the four-act structure above. Many sitcoms use a two-act structure with a teaser and tag. Squash-and-stretch cartoons use a one- or two-act structure. Rather than explaining all of them and their differences, far better to start with the most common format (one-hour dramas) and the most common structure (four acts).<br/><br/>For gaming purposes though I think the symmetrical four-act structure that dominates TV land is the most useful. If you're trying to replicate an act structure at the table with fairness and equal spotlight time for each player, using four acts of equal length--rather than the unequal act lengths of say five-act structure--is far superior. You could just as easily use two equal length acts as Fiasco did.<br/><br/>I think the teaser is a great way to kick the game off with the GM setting the scene and presenting the players with what's going on. Sure you could do that without a teaser, but I think it's easier to do it that way. So too with the tag. The GM gets to kick things off, why not let the table wind things down with the tag. I'm not saying any of these structures are better or worse for storytelling, only that this one is the best--I think--for gaming with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
