Here's part of his post: \n<blockquote>Oh, I might as well mention the Call of Cthulu card game, which is geared toward each player creating a "story" of sorts as they play their cards ("And then I journeyed to. . .Arkham Cemetary, where I met. . .Jebediah the gravidigger, who whispered some hints about the. . .Corrupt Cultists who prowl the place at night."). it's rather disjointed, as 1) each player's "story" is separate; no intersections or playing off of each other's events, and 2) the monsters that you play to fulfill your Story Card requirements, though the Story Card implies that they're something YOU encounter, are actually hazards that the OTHER player faces, which is a bit brain-addiling if you think about it too much.<br/><br/>I've played the game exactly once, with my brother, and while the TONE of the story is very much up to the participants (I crafted a rather sober and internally logical mystery story, and my bro whipped up a totally farcical comedy yarn), it DOES encourage you fairly well to string together gameplay with some sort of narrative. The fact that you have an Investigator card who actually journeys to locations and encounters things helps a lot, as well as the Story Cards themselves that give a pretty strong framework for what your story's about.</blockquote>\nI could imagine this being a relatively simple 2-player card game where each play is trying to:<br/>1. Build their own group of Dogs<br/>2. Solve the problems put before them<br/>3. Create complications for the other player's Dogs<br/><br/>Here are some card ideas off the top of my head:<br/>-Dogs<br/>--Cornelia (Acuity/Heart/Body/Will)<br/>-Townsfolk/Relationships<br/>--Elijah (Acuity/Heart/Body/Will)<br/>-Something's Wrong<br/>--Sin (Faithlessness: play a Demonic Attack for 2 points less)<br/>-Things<br/>--Patchwork Dog Coat (+1 to Body)<br/>--Big Knife (+2 to Fighting)<br/>-Traits<br/>--"I'm a Good Shot" (+1 to Guns; other player pays 1 point less to play a Complication)<br/>-Fallout<br/>--(Subtract 1 from any Stat)<br/><br/>But unlike CoC the CCG, I think it would be interesting to concentrate on crossing over the different stories.  So for example, if Player A plays a card as a Townsperson, Player B could use that card as a Relationship for one of their Dogs.  Thus when one player plays a card to be a buff for their side, it's not for free.  There are interdependencies that would really affect the strategy of what cards to play in a given situation.  There's obviously a large hole here in figuring out how to weave interesting stories and the mechanics of conflict which would need to be solved.  But that doesn't seem insurmountable to me. <br/><br/>But maybe the caffeine has taken me over.  Am I crazy here in thinking that there's potentially a nice card game here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62680/#Comment_62680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-02T04:47:43+00:00" title="April  2, 2007  4:47AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's potential, but I don't know enough about CCG design to even make recommendations where to start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62698/#Comment_62698" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-02T10:22:46+00:00" title="April  2, 2007 10:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it would be a bear to design (just like any other card game).
