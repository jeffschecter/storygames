These games often removed a lot of player choice in order to focus in on a specific game experience, like a thrilling roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>Many people in this community (myself included) were quite shocked by these stories, since the general trend in "Story Games" has been moving towards player agency and unpredictable outcomes. Pre-planning outcomes and scenes, leading the game to a specific finale... all these things are often seen as "trad gamer" tools, and anathema to "new school" play. Surely that's "railroading", and an evil, dysfunctional road to a terrible time?<br/><br/>And yet it seems that some people are creating these really controlled experiences and they really deliver. A lot of people engaged the gamers who wrote about this style of play with detailed questions and fascination. How is this done, and how is it done well?<br/><br/>Here's my question to you:<br/><br/>It's been a year.<br/><br/>If you were one of those people--shocked at this style of play, shocked by the content of those threads, reading along with fascination--how has your gaming changed since those discussions?<br/><br/>* Have you tried something new or something different in your own gaming, inspired by these stories of "successful railroading"?<br/><br/>* Have you participated in a game like this yourself?<br/><br/>* Have you run a game like this?<br/><br/>If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, how did it go? What was it like? What were the challenges, what were the successes?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392531/#Comment_392531" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T07:36:19+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  7:36AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To reiterate from 2011:<br/><br/>The GM in question was Todd Furler, whose games ought to be scripts for taut Hollywood thrillers and/or Twilight Zone episodes.

Once or twice, I've tried to substantially deviate from his path, only to find myself elegantly shunted into an interesting piece of fiction that either A) leads me back to the group and the railroad or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> causes the character a memorable downfall.<br/>But because everyone at the table is genuinely working hard to make it "movie-like," the role-playing has little B.S., and the psychological bond you form with your characters is strong, because your backstory usually has some kind of core trauma that's easy for one to access.<br/><br/>I have come up with two different games that also use a similar checklist to Todd's, but then I usually deviate from it as what the players' say interests me more.

I find that though the PC action is limited on a broad level, the key is to free up the player to choose how their PC reacts and feels about the events they experience. My aim is to make certain key PC decisions feel like they are the players own through a careful and complex presentation of information. The focus is on heightening the emotional side, which is why I think it resonates with some players. It also provides a reliably strong experience which is good for Cons. <br/><br/>Perhaps the best example of my beautiful railroad style is 'Tears of Vykyris', which won the local scenario design contest and can be found here:  <br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14355510/ToV%20Final.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14355510/ToV Final.pdf</a> (warning: 14MB)<br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14355510/Dragon_Master.ttf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14355510/Dragon_Master.ttf</a> (this font is needed to make the titles display properly)<br/><br/>The scenario is meticulously woven to tell a very specific story, even keeping secrets from the players about heir own PCs so they can hit the emotional beats at the right time.<br/><br/>FWIW in terms of non-Con games, my approach is much more open as I think the format is better suited for that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The lack of player agency can't be sustained easily over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392919/#Comment_392919" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T15:29:27+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  3:29PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

Also, I have found that with skill you can push the beautiful railroad a lot farther than you might think for good effect. Vykyris is a good example of this with the PC secrets being kept from the players.<br/><br/>My games are generally well received as far as I can tell. However, I do advertise the style and content of my games pretty transparently, so I rarely get any player surprised by what they are getting into. <br/><br/>I have never had a player "resist" in a way that causes problems. A GM has so many tools at their disposal to influence play that they don't need to push against player choices directly if the players are being reaosnable. Ultimately, on the surface, the game needs to give into those player's choices. Otherwise, the suspension of disbelief ends and you lose what you are trying to acheive. <br/><br/>A skilled GM will accomodate all player actions by listening to what the players are doing in game and adjusting. Also, a lot of detail goes into setting up the play in subtle ways. This is another reason why I think this style works well in a one-off format. If you writing a scenario for 3 to 4 hours of play along with pregenerated PCs, the GM has no excuse for a player feeling a need to resist. That would likely only arise if the GM had failed at a scenario design level.<br/><br/>Personally, I love this style of gaming for the one-off format. It creates highly emotional experiences that you would get in reading a book or watching a movie, with the added bonus of being a part of it. It is effortless for the player as they simply need to be in character and play that character hard, enjoying what they experience. They can relax and trust the GM that things will work out.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392940/#Comment_392940" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T19:13:25+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  7:13PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope I'm on topic with Paul's question "What were the challenges" -- Skywalker, I'd love to hear how you go about these two things:<br/><br/><b>1. Free up the player to choose how their PC reacts and feels about the events they experience.</b>  How do you reward and encourage this?  What do you do when a player gets really into portraying a character emotion?  What do you do when a player just sits there at a moment when you <i>hoped</i> they'd get really into portraying a character emotion?  And what expectations do you set along these lines before play?<br/><br/><b>2. Make certain key PC decisions feel like they are the players own through a careful and complex presentation of information. </b> Could you describe what this looks like at the table?  Is it the sort of thing where the players find out that the NPC they like has just been kidnapped by the NPC they hate, and so they obviously decide to go on a rescue mission?  I'm wondering if what you're going for is mostly a sense of ownership, or mostly an avoidance of intrusive manhandling, or some mix of the two, or what.<br/><br/>I ask about these because I've had some success with them as well, but not reliable, consistent, well-understood success.<br/><br/>What I should really do is read 'Tears of Vykyris', but computer issues are preventing that for the moment.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392945/#Comment_392945" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T19:45:20+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  7:45PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2012 8:19PM by Skywalker.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess the way to look it is that the aim of a beuatiful railroad game is not really any different from an open game. Its the method of getting there that's different. Neither is inherently capable of getting there, so you need to look at the virtues and hindrances of each approach. The open approach has the benefit of allowing everyone to provide direct input to reach the goal but can be hindered by the need to coordinate this input to reach a satisfactory outcome.  The beautiful railroad has a stronger input from just one person to reach the goal but can be hindered if that input feels restricting or removing player agency. This is also at the core why I think that a one-off Con experience, potentially with players who are strangers, tends to benefit from the later but why a longer term experience, with players who will have time to become familiar with each other, tends to benefit from the former.<br/><br/>In terms of your two questions:<br/><br/>1. A beautiful railroad is about taking a player to a moment of high emotion but it shouldn't direct what that emotion is or how it develops and impacts on the PC. The key to success is knowing when to have a strong handle on things and when to let go, similar to how kickers are open ended yet directed event to get a game moving. FWIW as a GM, I also don't hold any expectation as how strong that emotion is, so nothing hangs on that moment reaching a certain quantum of emotion. It is also not a simple black and white experience of getting it or not - its more of a scale. The only question is how far up that scale can you go.<br/><br/>2. Its hard to describe this one in isolation. If a scenario is well designed then a player will not see the beautiful railroad at all. Even more than that, ideally the player should feel like they are making those choices naturally and they are responsible for the consequences of them. This requires some skill on the GM part in presenting information and understanding how this will be interpretted by a player. The GM again needs to know their limits and where something cannot be predicted, the scenario needs to be designed to accomodate for it. If this sense of ownership is acheived, this makes the moments of high emotion even stronger (or "beautiful"). I think on some level the player has an understanding that things are being orchestrated by the GM to some extent, but this knowledge doesn't intrude on the players experience unless something untoward happens.<br/><br/>In terms of Vykyris, be aware that its 60% of the story.

Incidentally, last year I played in a game where 3 out of 5 players including the GM cried and the other 2 were also getting choked up. It was nominally FATE but more or less freeform. A lot of character interaction and character development evolved in play, but the GM certainly had a number of scenes planned, with a point to make, very similar to Todd\u2019s preparation. These were tailored to every character and worked very well.<br/><br/>Scenes where players cried: One character finding out his wife gave birth to a daughter when he was in Vietnam, but gave the child away because it was mentally disabled, and never told him about it, and him finally meeting and talking to his daughter. My character dying and being welcomed to the afterlife by his parents, whom he had never thanked for all they had done for him, which was his greatest regret. I guess the GM had scripted that scene before we started but she could never have guessed how unbelievably <i>fitting</i> it would turn out to be. I was one of the players who cried and I think it is sort of contagious. One player started, he was very open and unashamed about it, and that sort of opened the door for me.<br/><br/>There was another highly intense game I played in, also FATE, where the GM had an extremely carefully built-up scene in which our characters, in a very grim post-apocalyptic world (think \u201cThe Road\u201d), finally met some other survivors and then gradually realized that these people were killers, rapists and cannibals. He had carefully prepared it, with polaroid-style pictures for each NPC which he handed out to us, and with background music, too. He had prepared a virtual soundtrack for the game, which he used very selectively and to great effect (when he turned the music on, you knew something important and usually bad was about to happen).<br/><br/>This mode of play has a lot to do with honesty, empathy, and player skill. It\u2019s a mode of play where players make judgments, and decisions, and take responsibility for the fiction. They cannot defer to some rule or dice roll, they have to answer for their contributions personally. Immersion is not the point. It\u2019s investment. I\u2019ve rarely seen this kind of deep investment in indie games. Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019ve mostly played indie games with people who were so excited about all the funky rules and distributed authorities they forgot to really care about the fiction. There were exceptions, notably Sorcerer, Polaris, and The Shadow of Yesterday, with some very intense moments (not to the point of crying, though).<br/><br/>I think \u201cbeautiful railroading\u201d is a bit misleading. It is a very interactive play style <i>but</i> there is a person who, at some point, takes charge and <i>responsibility</i> and does it well. Respecting the other players, not letting them down, not going on some sort of ego trip, but <i>delivering</i>. This requires you as GM to read the players well, and understand how they see their characters. They may need you to take them someplace they cannot go on their own. Ron Edwards once compared it to a tandem, where the GM rides in the front and the player in the back, the GM is steering but he cannot really pick up speed unless the player is kicking, too.<br/><br/>I really love to play like that with good players. Contrary to what many \u201cGM guides\u201d would want to make you believe, I find that it requires absolutely no \u201cIllusionism\u201d, but rather works best when being absolutely transparent about who has authority over what, at what time.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393015/#Comment_393015" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T12:10:18+00:00" title="October 10, 2012 12:10PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the input, everyone.

I haven't had time to read your scenario yet (it's sitting on my desktop, waiting...), but can you maybe bring in a couple of examples of situations, and how they can be designed so as to be predictable, and then how they can be re-designed to accomodate unpredictability?

I keep thinking kickers are the good way to describe this approach in that they are a heavy handed GM tool but they don't dictate the players' reaction and subsequent action. The most obvious example is where you don't know how a player is going to react to a specific emotional cue. In that case, don't design the scenario that hangs on any specific emotion happening. Same goes for a player's reactions to and NPC. <br/><br/>The biggest issue here is that the longer the session gets the more you start getting events that are influenced by previous events. This will increase the chance of the railroad derailing as the GM will need to start making more difficult predictions. For this to work, the GM must adjust at each point along the way accordingly, such as between seesions. I often compare it to a tree diagram. Beautifully railroad the first branch, have strong ideas at what might happen after the first junction, but adjust at each junction. In a one-off Con scenario, this process shouldn't be necessary due to the limited length of the scenario. <br/><br/>It swings the other way too. Where you absolutely need something to happen, such as moving on to location X, be up front and honest about it. My scenarios tend to be heavily structured around three Acts and I scene frame heavily between those Acts to move the story in broad terms in the direction I want it to go. In Vykyris the two big Act shifts are: "the PCs return to the Capital with Wren" and "the PCs undertake the quest to confront Carnun". This are predetermined story movements. To assist these jumps, I heavily seeded the scenario with motivation, so that it would difficult to see how a player might take issue with them. Less reasonable jumps may well cause issues.<br/><br/>Unless I am prepared to accept whatever they answer, I don't ask the players what they want to do next. This become a quid pro quo type interaction with the players accepting certain decisions by me as a GM provided I am respectful and attentive at other times to the decisions they make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393030/#Comment_393030" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T13:34:02+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  1:34PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give some examples of "edge cases"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393031/#Comment_393031" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T13:36:55+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  1:36PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I ever used that term, so I am unsure what you mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393033/#Comment_393033" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T13:41:51+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  1:41PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm looking for examples of situations which were borderline "predictable".

It's a con game or one-shot, that is <i>clearly</i> about something specific, like a particular villain we need to confront or whatever. As a player, I've never had a problem going along with that sort of thing, since it's what the GM prepared and, if the scenario is at all decent, our characters would naturally want to do this thing (much as Skywalker describes). But the <i>other players</i> often fuck it up. They hesitate, they hem and haw, they find reasons not to go on the journey, and in all other ways they resist the obvious and perfectly well-intentioned railroad. And it slows down the game, and then when it finally gets moving they passive-aggressively resist the whole time, either with jokes or counterproductive actions or whatever.<br/><br/>Now, there are certainly techniques (hard scene framing / in media res type stuff comes to mind) that can be used to address this issue. But 1) it always feels like the players are much more at fault than the GM in these instances and 2) I suspect these players a) don't have a good handle on their own preferences b) didn't read the scenario description and c) have experienced so much ill-intentioned railroading (fudging the rules so the villain gets away or whatever) that they can't distinguish when the railroad is a perfectly reasonable one ("go to castle X to confront demon Y").<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393036/#Comment_393036" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T13:52:54+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  1:52PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree: going along with the premise of an adventure does not at all feel like "railroading" to me.<br/><br/>It IS interesting how many players have developed a culture of "anti-railroading" even in the absence of a railroad. (c.f. The various comments of gamers who think it's their *job* to screw up the GM's plans, as though the process of gaming--and the fun in games--is all about a power struggle between the players and the GM over who can direct the game. I've seen players congratulate themselves after a game, saying, "Wow! That was awesome. The GM tried to get us to kill the villain and rescue the princess, but we totally surprised her and destroyed her plan. We almost made her cry!" I also played in a few games where players would make contingency plans and write them down and then keep them secret from the GM, so that the GM couldn't modify them and thereby change the outcome of a scene. For instance, the player might say, "I'm setting up a booby trap, and I'm writing the location here on this piece of paper," so that later in the scene, the player could say, "Ah-ha!

It is quite a different story when the GM makes no such mention but still tries to force all the PCs to latch onto something they didn't buy into. I have no interest in being trapped in someone else's masturbatory power fantasy.<br/><br/>The real issue here is a lack of transparent communication pre-game between the gm and players. If a game is going to be a sandbox, great! Don't try to force a particular path then as the GM. If the game is meant to follow a specific plot, great! Make characters that are interested in the type of hooks provided by that plot.

"Playing to find out" is awesome, but playing to experience something really cool that someone else cooked up in advance is awesome too.  I fondly remember revealing that my NPCs were diabolical and getting that "Oh shit!" reaction.  Investment?  Hell yeah.<br/><br/>I suspect that the key for pre-plotted games, the make-or-break that divides them into Evil Railroads vs Tunnels of Fun, is the player role.  What's the player there to do, and do they know that, and are they empowered and inspired to actually do it?<br/><br/>Skywalker, that's what I was getting at with my questions, but alas, I didn't get there from your answers.  "Know when to take the reins and when to back off" and "take them to a moment of high emotion but then don't direct where it goes" sound like great orientation if you know your toolkit and your options with it.  But I don't know what your toolkit is.<br/><br/>I started a bunch of Forge threads about this and drummed up a nice pile of ideas and data points, but I think the next step is to actually pick a direction and try to make a game out of it.

It\u2019s important for GMs to understand that the players\u2019 trust is not their God given right as GMs, but something they have to earn. And transparency is a very important tool for that. It doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot keep some stuff about your back story secret for the \u201cgrand revelation\u201d. But it means you should be up-front about when you are giving the players a real choice and when you are not.<br/><br/>I would like to address a couple of misconceptions I often see in people who have never experienced the functional way of playing this.<br/><br/><b>\u201cThe Script sucks\u201d</b><br/><br/>Yeah, when the Script sucks, it sucks. Implausible, uninspired stories, pet NPCs, GMs making PCs look like fools, etc. The intarwebs are full of stories about sucky Scripts from sucky GMs. But even if the Script does not particularly suck, the assumption often seems to be that a collaboratively improvised plot would be more interesting and fun. Conversely, my experience with collaboratively improvised plots has been mixed, often there were so many inconsistencies that character choices seemed disconnected and empty. But that\u2019s not the point. Take the example from my earlier post. The carefully planned gradual revelation, backed up with hand-outs and music and elaborate NPC portrayal. This was a fantastic moment and I didn\u2019t mind telling the GM right at the table that it was. It could never have been pulled off without preparation.<br/><br/><b>\u201cThe events are forced on the players\u201d</b><br/><br/>Technically, it is correct that the players are not in control of fictional events. Depending on the particular techniques applied, they might not even have full ownership of their characters and the characters\u2019 background. But in a functional, mature group, this does not imply that anything happens against the players\u2019 will. The GM does not actually hold any power to force anything on the players against their will, no more than he can force them to sit down at his table. As I see it, the GM takes on a <i>responsibility</i>. The players are putting something in your hands and you are required to handle it with care. Describing that as \u201cforcing something on the players\u201d is just inadequate.<br/><br/><b>\u201cInequality sucks\u201d</b><br/><br/>In these kinds of games, the GM has much more control over fictional events and even play style than the players. The players still make meaningful contributions (see below), but the leverage is pretty high. The game will pretty much be \u201cthe GM\u2019s game\u201d, he gets to say what\u2019s what. Again, see the thread linked by Paul, where Todd explains how he introduces his \u201cdictated social contract\u201d. Sure, if the GM isn\u2019t consistent in his rulings, if he shows poor judgment or just turns out to be an immature griefer, this sort of inequality makes things worse. But the problem, in that case, is the GM being a dumbass, not the GM\u2019s role per se. On the other hand, a GM with the proper leadership qualities, common sense and good intentions will do a great job at getting the game on track, establishing tone and pace etc. (especially useful in a convention game).  This is a real advantage if you ask me. It\u2019s also absolutely reasonable to ask players who sit down at such a GM\u2019s table that they play that GM\u2019s game. This is not materially different than asking players who sit down to play some GM-less indie game that they play the game as written and intended by the designer. <br/><br/><b>\u201cThe players cannot contribute meaningfully\u201d</b><br/><br/>So let\u2019s say I\u2019m running a game of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I have a bog-standard monster of the week scenario. I have scripted the monster\u2019s first appearance, the clue that leads to the monster\u2019s weakness, the showdown where the heroes defeat the monster, and for some soap opera on the side I have hooked one player character\u2019s love interest into the plot. I run the adventure and guess what, the monster\u2019s first appearance goes down as intended, the heroes find the clue as intended, the love interest gets involved as intended and there is a kiss, and in the end the monster is defeated as intended. All of this is no surprise to anyone at the table. And all of this tells you <i>nothing</i> about whether the players have contributed meaningfully. Did they play their characters in the scenes? Did they make witty comments, express the nature of their characters, maybe even progress their relationships with other characters? Did they come up with inventive and fun moves in combat? Did one of them save the day while another suffered some embarrassment? Were there memorable one-liners? Events that players reflected upon in-character? That kiss, what was it to the player character? Could that scene have gone differently? All of this can mean a great deal. And hey, you know, it\u2019s not God given either that I always have to follow the Script to the last letter. If the players make some really unexpected choices, the day just might come where something unexpected happens, the monster wins, or a PC dies. And when that happens, absolute transparency will also be key to the players enjoying it rather than being disappointed because they thought they had the a safety net when they hadn\u2019t.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393111/#Comment_393111" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T09:09:06+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  9:09AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My concern in railroaded games is that choices are meaningless.

But agreeing with it in the theoretical sense is not as illuminating as understanding the specifics. I asked earlier if you could provide some examples of "borderline" situations (where you might have felt that you could slip from a happily predictable outcome - "The adventuring party agrees to go on the adventure" - to an unpredictable, railroad-able outcome - "The party agrees to let the guy who's secretly a villain into their plans"). <br/><br/>If you'd like to keep contributing to this thread (and I hope you will!), my humble request is for some examples. What are some particular difficult situations that come up in your games which feel like they could easily slide from "coherent, GM-led game" to "bad railroading", and how did you deal with them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393136/#Comment_393136" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T12:55:52+00:00" title="October 11, 2012 12:55PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TBH I find dissecting the matter down into specific examples to be difficult. The examples are one of two types. The first are those that are picked up during scenario creation, and are usually dealt with through the design. However, scenario design involves so much context and layers that isolating individual points beyond pointing at the scenario is hard. <br/><br/>The second are those that crop up in play. The game goes in a direction that is unexpected making the orignal plan of the GM problematic or even invalid, so adjustment is needed These only happen once and on the fly. Again, they require context to explain the personalities involved and how the game got to that point. Again, it is difficult to isolate specific examples.<br/><br/>On saying that, I have given some specific example above, such as dealing with broader story development through scene framing. The scenario linked to is also probably the best example I can give of the first type. I will have a think about examples that might be more easily isolated for the purposes of this thread and post any that come to mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393148/#Comment_393148" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T14:48:42+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  2:48PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2012 2:49PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, I'd guess that what you're reporting, unless the GM's simply a dick, might be a combo of GM desire to control plot + GM desire to give choices + choice-giving habits that don't work here.

I think the ultimate issue is as I have raised above but you raise an interesting point as to the fact that you can't assume absolute awareness to the people in the game. I guess there are two aspects of this. One is whether the player is aware that the GM is doing something they wouldn't consent to and the whether the GM is aware that the thing being done lacks the players consent. <br/><br/>In either case, both are immediately alleviated by better communication around the table as it raises awareness. However, I also suspect that many RPGers rely on trust and respect in dealing with those situations where awareness is lacking. Though this does open up the potential for an abuse of trust and disrespect, which covers what you appear to be getting at in regard to a railroading GM and also the disruptive player scenario given above.<br/><br/>But yeah, if a GM knows that a player would not consent to certain actions but does them regardless and obfuscates them, then its a breach of trust and you have a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393163/#Comment_393163" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T18:32:30+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  6:32PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skywalker,<br/><br/>That makes sense to me.

The reason that I think this comment is more valid is that all RPGing involves direction from the other players that will restrict and influence you. In a conventional game, a lot of this direction is going to come from the GM given the way the game is designed. As such, the mere fact that a GM/player has this influence or restricts you in some way is in and of itself not an issue. The problem arises where the influence and restrict is unfair in some way, especially if it reduces your expected ability to contribute to the game. This is when "railroading" occurs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393177/#Comment_393177" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-12T00:22:54+00:00" title="October 12, 2012 12:22AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok. So it\u2019s about the \u201cmeaningful choices\u201d that people get hung up. Let\u2019s first check the assumptions here. If the assumption is that players can <i>only</i> contribute meaningfully <i>at all</i> if their choices, as Callan put it, \u201cheavily influence the outcome of play\u201d, then the assumption is wrong. If you insist on that as a premise, we can stop talking, because that is not how it works for people who enjoy this mode of play. See my above example.<br/><br/>On the other hand, what Adam is describing as \u201cthrow choices at players, and then find some sneaky GM Force to use to make the result of the choice turn out exactly the way they planned it in the first place\u201d is indeed a bullshit technique enforced by bullshit conventions and bullshit advice in RPG books. I must admit I have seen players who did not seem to notice this at the table, which has always bewildered me because usually it was painfully obvious if you only looked for it. That\u2019s why I emphasize transparency so much.<br/><br/>On the risk of sounding patronizing, in discussions like these, I often feel that people who have suffered badly from crappy dishonest railroad-y GMs in the past find it hard to overcome their frustration and accept that there is a different way to do it. Please read the thread linked in the first post, if you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s really a very illuminating actual play account. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_393183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393183/#Comment_393183" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-12T01:39:28+00:00" title="October 12, 2012  1:39AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2012 3:24AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some elements to consider, in relation to what we get from a role-playing game:<br/>1 - Social content; sharing experiences, the empowerment of interaction, group dynamics<br/>2 - Narrative content; the story-arc, plot and intellectual challenge, narrative logics and beauty<br/>3 - Ethical content; dilemmas we face, choice and consequence, the moral impact of fictional conflicts<br/>4 - Emotional content; how we feel during and after a game, the emotional impact of interaction and fiction<br/>5 - Magic content; ritualistic form and effect, fictional flow, trans-personal experiences, immersion<br/><br/>In my view, all these elements are present in all role-playing games, in various degrees. There are a million ways to bring the different elements in a game to the foreground. A million different ways to balance them, and to make them shift in a game. Most designers know little about the scope of elements present in their role-playing games, and that is true for most leaders and players of these games too. <br/><br/>But if we are to discuss "the outcome of play", this is a necessary point of view. We need to know that the outcome is diverse, and changeable, and that it may be wrought in a million different ways. The different types of content are present in various degrees, and players have various degrees of influence upon them in different games.<br/><br/>To break it down; <br/>- The <i>social content</i> is always part of it, whatever game you play, but some games are better in supporting positive dynamics. <br/>- The <i>magic content</i> is always part of it too. The "magic" of role-playing games takes place when we meet, sit down, and goes into a shared frame of mind that is conductive to effective game-play. In a normal rpg it does not lead to trans-personal experiences, nor flow and immersion, but it may do so, occasionally. Most players have some experience with flow or immersion.<br/>- In addition, in a classical rpg, with a leader and players, the players often gets a "certificate" to influence the <i>narrative content</i>; through the choices of their characters they have a direct impact on the story-arc. <br/>- The players will often influence the <i>ethical content</i> too, in a standard classical game of some quality. But not always; the ethical content may be downplayed to the extent that it is totally missing (<i>Toon</i> is a great game with next to no ethical content).<br/><br/>The above is how I would describe an ordinary <i>classical rpg</i> (leader + players). <br/><br/>But there are different ways of doing this. If you lift the ethical content of play, and make use of more effective magics, you get another game altogether. If you hunt for strong relations and emotional buy-in, rather than action, you get a totally different game, of course. This may be done in classical games, and it is very often done in modern games. <br/><br/>The use of <i>railroading</i> is one way of tilting the balance of content. You take away the players "certificate" to influence the story-arc, and make sure that other sides of play takes precedence; ethical content, emotional, magical ... <br/>- there are right ways to do all kinds of game-play, and bad ways to do it. <br/><i>Railroading</i> has stood out as a bad way of doing it due to the simple fact that traditional classical games comes with a player "certificate" for influencing the story-arc; railroading is anathema to that kind of game-play. But it is, really, only a tool that may be used to good effect, in the right type of role-playing game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393185/#Comment_393185" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-12T02:11:02+00:00" title="October 12, 2012  2:11AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2012 2:19AM by Callan_S.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skywalker,<br/><i>"its only railroading if the player actually feels unfairly restricted or disenfranchised by the actions of the GM"</i><br/>Again that testing method suffers from potential lack of perception on the players part.

The slow down in how the GM talks and how he makes statements while looking over the players, to me, seems to be a way of asking for consent for the fictional events he's just described. The pause is one of seeing if anyone argues, or if there is silent consent/silent approval. If you contrast this against something like rolling damage after scoring a hit, that goes really fast - no one pauses to check if you get to roll damage or what damage die is the right size - everyones consented to the rules of that already. So it goes really fast.<br/><br/>Seems to be how the process goes to me, with much consent asking, even if it's simply the GM scanning the group for a moment, and whether people look back as if to say 'of course' or whether they verbally argue something. Just outlining the process as I see it.<br/><br/>Frank,<br/><i>If the assumption is that players can only contribute meaningfully at all if their choices, as Callan put it, \u201cheavily influence the outcome of play\u201d, then the assumption is wrong.</i><br/>If what the player thinks the GM has said the game involves/how the game works, then the assumption is not wrong.<br/><br/>If the player thinks the GM has said or implied the game will be about them making up witty lines for their PC's and choreographing cool moves and that is indeed the players role in play, then that assumption is missplaced, I do agree.<br/><br/>(and just to note the tragic middle ground; where a player is so used to making witty lines and moves and that's it, they just have no motivation to actually make any choices that heavily influencing the outcome. They keep looking for the quest, or the plot. I've played with these guys. Not to knock either mode, but when someone is stuck in one of them...that's an issue)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393188/#Comment_393188" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-12T03:18:29+00:00" title="October 12, 2012  3:18AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to ask this open question, if "Railroad" is a negative term, what is the positive term for this?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393189/#Comment_393189" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-12T03:19:05+00:00" title="October 12, 2012  3:19AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2012 3:26AM by Frank T.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Callan, I don't think we disagree but I kind of think you are derailing the thread.<br/><br/>Edited to add: I would like to somehow convey to you and others to whom this mode of play is alien how utterly fulfilling it can be to play in it, to contribute a consitent and captivating character protrayal, to experience and be invested in an intricate fiction, to shape and color the minute-by-minute details, if not the overall outcome of fictional events, to add a personal note to each and every scene in a very, very interactive way, to pick up your fellow players' contributions and build on them. And as a GM, to hold it all together, to subtly, elegantly steer it in a direction, to carefully listen to the players, adapt to what they are doing, to find the right spot to insert your scripted material (or sometimes be willing and able to drop it), to be the conductor of this magnificent concert when everyone is just really in tune and you create something beautiful and meaningful together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393191/#Comment_393191" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-12T03:37:20+00:00" title="October 12, 2012  3:37AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2012 12:35PM by Skywalker.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Again that testing method suffers from potential lack of perception on the players part.

I agreed with your point that if the GM is aware of a problem but continues regardless then this is a breach of trust. But this point needs to be developed beyond simply pointing a finger at the GM. If you raise the player's perception or lack of it as an issue, surely the GM's perception is also a matter requiring examination too, as does how the group communicates. The crux of the matter is at the point that the player or GM become aware that that there is a problem and what they do about it.<br/><br/>As above, I think you are identifying much wider issues that need to be addressed in any RPG.

Sorry I'm late to the party. That'll be my excuse for the long post.<br/><br/>I'm Todd, the GM whose game was mentioned in the thread "4 Out of 7 Cried,\u201d which was linked to at the top of this thread.<br/><br/>It makes me very happy to see that others have gotten positive feedback from their players about having highly structured games. As others have noted, railroading is a tool which can be wielded for good or ill.<br/><br/>I'd like to offer a few observations that might make it easier to understand what's going on under the hood for my Unknown Armies games. (I'm not talking about my pulp games here, because I shamelessly railroad in those. UA is more nuanced.) You can then decide whether that's "railroady,\u201d for any given definition of railroady that works for you. Skywalker and others, I'd like to hear if what I'm describing below applies to your games as well.<br/><br/>First Thing: I create all the characters for my convention games. I know what makes them tick, I know what they want, and I know how desperate (or not) they are to get it. That makes it fairly easy to anticipate how the characters are likely to respond, in very general terms, to any given stimulus. If you think about it, when most reasonable people -- or characters --  are presented with a challenge, they only consider two or three options for dealing with it.<br/><br/>The fact that I've considered those options and prepared for them can be mistaken for the idea that the players' choices have been foreordained. I assure you that's not the case.<br/><br/>Second Thing: I run each game session as a movie. I explain to my players that I pay for the film by the inch, so every second that a character -- PC or NPC -- is on camera has to have a point. We don't make the audience sit through mundane stuff, unless there's a really good reason. <br/><br/>This means that, as Evan observed above, I have a list of scenes that I plan to go through. Each scene has a purpose. Sometimes it's to reveal a clue, sometimes to lead to a conflict, sometimes just to showcase the interactions between two or more PCs. When you cut out all of the scenes that have no point, the result feels very structured. <br/><br/>The player characters are not puppets on strings, so I have no idea how any of the scenes will end. I strongly frame all of my scenes -- even the scenes that I have to improvise because the PCs made substantial changes to the plot. That may make it sound as if I planned for the PCs to get to this particular scene, come hell or high water.<br/><br/>Third Thing: I don't roll dice when I'm the GM, even for games where I'm supposed to. I determine outcomes based on either what seems reasonable, or on the players' die rolls. <br/><br/>I suspect that when you put these three Things together, a player could conclude that no matter what he does, I'm putting him back on "the right track.\u201d The only times I do that are to keep my movie from fragmenting into six separate movies. I think the appearance of being herded comes from the fact that players tend to restrict themselves to reasonable choices. There are a finite number of those, so I've been able to plan for them. <br/><br/>Evan, does all of this sound like a possible explanation for what you've experienced at my table? Let me know if I've done something that doesn't fit with this explanation.<br/><br/>To illustrate with a simple example, if the PCs are teenagers and Scene 8 starts in the high school (because I anticipate this is where they'll get the first taste of the villain's power and potentially find a clue), what would have to happen for Scene 8 to not be in the high school? <br/><br/>Well, they could burn down the high school in Scene 7. But reasonable people don't generally do that sort of thing. Or all the PCs could decide not to go to school the next day. But since I created the PCs, I can guarantee that at least one of them won't be comfortable with that decision. So Scene 8 is probably going to be at the school, as I planned. <br/><br/>But if the PCs have come up with some believable reason that Scene 8 shouldn't be at the school, then it's somewhere else.<br/><br/>So my convention adventures are structured, but the scenes are open-ended. <br/><br/>On those rare occasions when I <i>do</i> need outcomes to be foreordained, I'll tell my players that. But I'll also tell them how to have fun within those constraints.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

Don't predict outcomes. I liken this aspect to "kickers". The GM is taking a heavy hand in getting the players to certain scenes loaded with tension, drama, story and character. However, once there, the players are the ones who get to play out those scenes without fetter. This can heighten their enjoyment and emotion as they can more easily loose themselves in the scenes in-character. <br/><br/>I also think this style relies heavily on the GM understanding what's absolutely necessary to hit the beats he wants and what's not (such as your scene 8 comment). The later should always be sacrificed to player choices, if in conflict. If you do this, the former also becomes more flexible. The GM should make the likelihood of conflict between the former and player choices minimal, first by reducing what's necessary as much as possible. If conflict arises then take an honest and open approach to resolve it. If you are in doubt, it may even be better to simply bypass the potential conflict with scene framing or with an OOC direction.   <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393380/#Comment_393380" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T20:07:22+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  8:07PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's fairly similar to many published games (and particularly things like Nordic LARP), which have a preset sequence of scenes, but complete freedom within each scene for the players to take action and/or react to what is going on.<br/><br/>Is there any reason not to describe it this way upfront? <br/><br/>("Okay, friends, we'll be playing through a sequence of pre-set scenes I will frame for you.

As Will GM for Food pointed out, a lot about a scene can change based on player choices even if the GM has a strong idea what the skeleton of those scenes will be.

But not always.<br/><br/>Todd, my best guess is that you, as GM and Director, are the primary arbiter of "what's appreciated", both before and during play.  "Yes, like that" and "No, try a little more like this".  Right?  The players' contributions are valued insofar as they fit well within the movie you're crafting, as judged by you.  Since you're good at crafting these movies, that process is productive, and people buy into it.  (And I imagine that a bit of roleplay that Todd finds to be good for the scene, well, the other players will probably appreciate it too.)  Does that sound accurate?<br/><br/>If so, then I get how this is viable within a word-of-mouth community that verifies who's a good GM, but I worry that it isn't portable beyond that.  I mean, I sure wouldn't sign up to have all my contributions validated by one person who I knew nothing about.  In that case, I think an explicit and objective standard for the validation would make a big difference for me.<br/><br/>Example: "I want you to make my fraught situations resonate with your character's personal reactions.  Show us how they feel when my events happen.  You determine the emotion, just be sure you convey it to us."  Oh, okay, I enjoy doing that, I think I'm pretty good at it; let's go!<br/><br/>Sorry if I'm repeating myself from the thread last year.

There was another thread from last year where a poster pointed out that he thought too many designers were trying to codify things like creativity into the rules of a game and that doing so is a fool's errand. I agree with him. One of the things that kept me away from the indie game scene for a long time is that game designers would stop just short of claiming things like "the rules of my game guarantee that your players will overflow with creativity and that each session will produce a moving story." I have yet to see a set of rules that can, for example, turn a bad player into a fountain of creativity.<br/><br/>There's a reason that storytelling, while grounded in sound principles, is still an art and not a science.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393453/#Comment_393453" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-15T10:42:27+00:00" title="October 15, 2012 10:42AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Todd,<br/><br/>That's already super helpful, but I think Dave's making a good point, too:<br/><br/>Yeah, you can't codify or mechanize specific types of fun.

Again, this is very much how I view it too.<br/><br/>In terms of why the GM's belief should be given more weight, I think its also important to point out that in a Convention scenario of this kind, the GM will likely have spent many hours on it including creating the PCs.

Things like picking from a list, asking leading rather than open-ended questions, and asking players to add details to things introduced by the GM. Note that these are all closely related to "beautiful railroading" techniques! Oh, and I would also add the Mouse Guard trick of having the first half of the session be railroady, but the second be more open-ended. (I think Luke points out somewhere, either in the text or on the forums, that lots of GMs already use this structure\u2014but how do they communicate it?)<br/><br/>Also, I know it's a cliche, but the people who have trouble being creative? Who absolutely cannot or will not come up with anything, even if the prompts are extremely guiding? Almost always long-time gamers.

Definitely many hours, though.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393516/#Comment_393516" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-15T23:30:25+00:00" title="October 15, 2012 11:30PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Wall of text incoming.<br/><br/>Todd: <br/><br/>Thanks for chiming in. I basically agree with everything you have said. My own \u201ctried and true\u201d techniques for communicating my expectations are a little different from yours but serve the same purpose. Also, I\u2019ve only been coming back to this style of play after some years of experimenting with indie games, bass playing and such, with very mixed results.<br/><br/>An interesting point you are touching on is genre. I think that\u2019s absolutely vital. You see, most people posting in this thread are old Forge regulars and as such are used to talking about the actual people at the table, how these people communicate, how the game mechanics tie into that, etc. It has been a major achievement of the Forge that this is now recognized as a valid thing to talk about, which it wasn\u2019t back in the 90s, really. But I suggest that fictional content and genre are a great deal more important, in particular to the play style we are talking about here, than a \u201cForge mindset\u201d may sometimes lead you to believe. (And you will find that Ron Edwards has been saying this all over.)<br/><br/>You mention your Pulp games, which are much more scripted than the horror games. I suggest that this is a logical, maybe even mandatory, consequence of genre and tropes. I once ran an \u201cIndiana Jones at river Kwai\u201d style adventure set in Thailand during WWII, complete with Nazi agents and a lost jungle temple. I daresay that nobody would have wanted this scenario to end in any other way than a dramatic showdown in the heart of the temple. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if you are running a genre that relies on drama and nuanced character portrayals, you need a different approach. The game I mentioned earlier, where I and two other players cried, was a road movie themed around growing old, with references like \u201cThe Bucket List\u201d setting the tone. So naturally the GM in that game needed to adapt much more to where we were taking our characters, but she had prepared the route, and some sites/scenes along the way, to trigger our characters\u2019 issues and have some sort of story arc. This was very elegantly done by giving us a destination and a road map for the trip which sort of necessarily included certain landmarks. So, yeah, sure, she took some decisions there in preparing the scenario which we as players had no influence on. That was her job and she did it very well. I am dead sure that if we had improvised the whole thing on the fly, it would not have been half as good. But still, a lot, and I mean a LOT of what happened in play was totally dynamic, open-ended character interaction. And how our characters felt about things, whether they could overcome their issues at last, that was decided by us, the players, alone. <br/> <br/>In your convention games you work with pre-generated characters which is the only reasonable thing to do in a convention game, I guess. It\u2019s not always worked out for me as a player but I guess it just depends a whole lot on how good the pre-generated characters are. In the road movie game I mentioned above, we created the characters in a forum thread way before the game session, so the GM built the whole scenario around these characters created by the players. (Incidentally, one player had to skip the game on short notice so another player picked up the character, the one with the mentally disabled child, and had a blast.) But the characters were all clearly set up with the clear objective being, \u201cyou are old, you are alone, you are in a nursing home, you have this one thing you always wanted to achieve but never did\u201d. Again, I think investment in the fictional characters and events is an absolute key factor, and also, playing on purpose.  <br/><br/>The GM as the scenario designer is in charge of that purpose, which doesn\u2019t mean he cannot listen and adapt, but I find it extremely helpful in these kinds of games, and in particular when I\u2019m building my own character, when the GM takes a strong lead. Conversely, I\u2019ve seen games where the GM basically spread his hands and said, \u201cSo, I\u2019m all open, players, what do you want to do?\u201d Maybe he thought he was being better than those evil GM dictators but actually he was just being a pain in everyone\u2019s ass.<br/><br/>I think some indie games have tried to create a safe space where \u201ceverybody is awesome\u201d. But when everybody is awesome, your awesome may have a pretty low standard depending on who is playing. As a GM running a \u201cbeautiful railroad\u201d you take a leap of faith. You don\u2019t get a guarantee that you are going to be awesome. Sometimes you are going to just suck. Even the best sometimes mess it up. It requires skill, and focus, and a bit of luck. This is somewhat scary but so is everything that is highly rewarding when it works.<br/><br/>Dave:<br/><br/>Ever the searcher for the \u201cperfect formula\u201d, right? :-) I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have an answer that satisfies you this time around. Contributions are meaningful because the players are invested in them. The players are invested in them because they care about the fiction. Making the players care about the fiction is a matter of creativity, empathy, and to a degree, acting and narrative skill. It\u2019s all about the people and nothing about the formula. You can look at the techniques involved but the techniques need to adapt to the needs of the people, which change from group to group and over time for a given group. As a game designer, I try to design rules in a way that (a) requires the players to communicate their intentions and be transparent about authorities, and (b) allows the group to build their own conventions about how to apply the rules.<br/><br/>- Frank<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393523/#Comment_393523" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-16T01:58:32+00:00" title="October 16, 2012  1:58AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2012 1:59AM by Frank T.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.: In my experience, talking about play style and preferences in the abstract it very much futile because people relate what you are saying to their personal experience, which may be very different from yours, so you may think you understand each other but whether you really do, only actual play will tell. The best way to communicate about these things, I think, is right in the middle of play, when you can be very conrete about your intentions and expectations.

It wasn't tabletop--it was a MUSH* thing--but I think it's close enough for government work. I GMed two separate groups simultaneously: eight PCs in one, nine in the other. It was a race between the two groups to find a treasure. I made it clear that only one group would get the treasure.<br/><br/>It was a total railroad in terms of plot structure. I even warned them. However, I had real race mechanics, and those actually mattered. Player decisions mattered because a wrong move could lose the race.<br/><br/>They were following a riddle I made up. The clues were pretty transparent. The group would move from place to place and figure out what the next line of the riddle meant. One of the clues strongly suggested that they needed to scale a mountain before sundown and then wait for the sun to go down to get the next direction. One group did that. The other group, who was enjoying a 30 minute lead, decided they didn't want to wait on top the mountain while the other group caught up with them, so they just picked a random direction and started exploring. They chose wrong, and figured out six hours later that they were on a wild goose chase. What I thought was an entirely railroady section of plot was quickly "off the rails." They eventually returned to the top of the ridge and tracked the other group to the next spot, but by then they'd lost the race. They didn't know that yet.<br/><br/>Still, they had more of the riddle to solve and there were tons of temple puzzles and stuff. More of a railroad, since ostensibly the adventure was about whether or not they could solve the riddles, but I was really more interested in how they engaged each riddle. See, the "gauntlet" was a series of three temples with riddles they had to figure out. Each temple was dedicated to a different goddess (deities they know well from years of play) and the riddles tested their knowledge of the setting and their creativity. They had a ton of fun brainstorming. The things the characters did will change them forever. However, there were points where they just couldn't get past certain challenges, and I spoon-fed them information till they figured it out. After all, the success of the adventure relied on them not being abysmal failures at treasure hunting, so I pushed the train along.<br/><br/>There were serious choices to make. Choices that mattered. At one point, they had to leave all their possessions behind, but one. Which would they keep? For some, it was "what is the most useful for the treasure hunt" (a shovel, a knife). For others, it was sentimentality (a wedding necklace, a clan leadership medallion). At another point, they risked serious bodily harm, scaling a jagged obsidian cliff. A few people took serious (mechanical) damage but they chose to continue. They had other options (backtrack, wait another day for the sunrise to see the clue again, explore a bit more) but they chose this brute-force approach (and ultimately succeeded without deaths). Later on, in the final temple, they were told they could open only one of the stone boxes in front of the five goddess statues. Which one would they choose? What was their reasoning? Would they offend any of them with their choice? <br/><br/>As GM, I filled their heads with fantastic imagery and a magical experience they don't normally get on this particular game. They touched divinity. Because magic is rare in the setting, or at least disguised, interacting with high fantasy was novel and exciting. I like to think of it as the expensive CG effects in a movie. But moviegoers have no expectation of choice in a movie. They are along for the ride. Gamers generally want to know that they made choices that mattered.  Not every choice has to matter, though.<br/><br/>I don't think railroads have to be all-or-nothing affairs. My adventure was a mix of GM-force to push the adventure along. There was a player expectation that they'd /see it all/ and /get to the end/. There was no player expectation that they'd win the treasure or all survive. The choices they made kept them alive, made them win or lose the race, <br/><br/>I think genre expectations are important. Railroading is a great tool for enforcing them. I think you have to understand what a group wants out of a game to figure out how much railroading is permissible. If they are focused mainly on fulfilling genre expectations (an Indiana Jones-style game likely fits this bill), then the players probably want some GM force to make that happen. Do you really need to hide it from them or lie about it though? If a group is focused on overcoming challenges and proving their awesomeness, there are probably certain things a GM should not force, or it invalidates the purpose of play, right? Don't mess with the encounter levels mid-encounter in a challenge-basd 4E game just because they're winning or losing. Let the chips fall where they may. And a lot of GM force techniques run antithetical to play that's all about human-at-the-table choices, like Sorcerer or Dogs in the Vineyard. Not all, but railroading a plot is right out, because there shouldn't be a plot to begin with.<br/><br/>In the end, my two groups had a blast. The adventure was railroady, but its priorities were setting exploration and in-character personal choices (as opposed to a player's at-the-table preferences). It looked like a challenge-based adventure, but that wasn't the main thrust of it, and when I let the players know clearly that I was advancing them past certain things to "get to the interesting parts," they were fine with that. They nodded in the realization that /getting to the end/ was a necessary part of the story we were ALL telling, and that they were meant to solve the riddles all along. What we didn't know--what the players were contributing in a meaningful way--is how their characters reacted to events. No one could predict with certainty how their characters would change as a result of this epic adventure, and we were playing to find out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* online multiplayer text-based RPG                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393631/#Comment_393631" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-16T18:56:23+00:00" title="October 16, 2012  6:56PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Frank T</b> said:<br/>most people posting in this thread are old Forge regulars and as such are used to talking about the actual people at the table, how these people communicate, how the game mechanics tie into that, etc.</blockquote>\nThis is one of the reasons why I find this thread so moving.<br/>The "railroaded" game was one of our old enemies from 2001-2002, along with "incoherence," "Pawn stance," etc.<br/>Now we've got (I think) a much more holistic understanding of the relationship between GM power, player information/agency, and the system's role in reinforcing that relationship.<br/>I love it.<br/><br/>According to many of the posts on the threads, a primary aspect of play being explored in a "railroaded" game (assuming everyone buys into it) is not character action but <i>character reaction</i>.

Stuff like, "Orcs?  My guy is scared of Orcs.  He's never seen them, but heard stories as a kid, and where he grew up, on a trade route, all the merchants were afraid of them.  So they've sort of been a bogeyman for him.  So he's probably kinda freaked out right now, and is deciding whether to join in the fight or hide."<br/><br/>This was not fun for the group, because the game needed player character actions to push it forward.  "Yeah, okay, rookie, so what <i>is</i> your decision?  What do you <i>do</i>?"<br/><br/>This, I think, is rather endemic to the segment of indie games concerned with moral quandary and the costs of choices and "how far are you willing to go?"

It is indeed very helpful to know whether the GM <i>expects</i> me to take decisive action at a given moment. Transparency over and over.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393698/#Comment_393698" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-17T12:47:15+00:00" title="October 17, 2012 12:47PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Adam!<br/><br/>I'm glad you posted about an actual game you ran, and how it went. It's interesting to hear that it seems like you balanced "pushing them forward towards the interesting stuff" and still arbitrating impartially which team was "winning the race". Did that ever present conundrums for you in play?<br/><br/>I hope more people will follow in Adam's wake and talk about their recent game experiences. <br/><br/>Here are the questions I posted at the beginning of this thread, once again:\n<blockquote>how has your gaming changed since those discussions?<br/><br/>* Have you tried something new or something different in your own gaming, inspired by these stories of "successful railroading"?<br/><br/>* Have you participated in a game like this yourself?<br/><br/>* Have you run a game like this?<br/><br/>If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, how did it go? What was it like? What were the challenges, what were the successes?<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393779/#Comment_393779" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-18T10:44:18+00:00" title="October 18, 2012 10:44AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had set out the rules for the race in advance, and I gauged time impartially. Towards the middle, the first team was so far behind that they just couldn't plausibly catch up unless the second team did something totally stupid (which was possible, since that's how the first team got behind). The teams had issues with the same puzzles, or equivalent ones, so I gave them equal aid getting past them. Other game staff (not GMs, but people who could GM, if you follow) were watching and probably would have said something if I gave one team an unfair advantage over the other.<br/><br/>With the pressure of the race out of the way, it became all about the thematic elements, and there weren't any conundrums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393837/#Comment_393837" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-18T21:11:38+00:00" title="October 18, 2012  9:11PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you effectively switched from "impartially refereeing a race" to "pushing play towards thematically interesting elements" at some point during the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393902/#Comment_393902" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T09:21:13+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  9:21AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I think I always wanted it to be a thematic thing and not just a race. The race was color. The Sim stuff (fidelity to setting, fidelity to character) was the focus. A believable race supported fidelity to setting. The MUSH in question (<a href="http://firan.legendary.org" rel="nofollow">FiranMUX</a>) has been around for like 12 years and has 50 years of multigenerational socio-political setting material created by staff and players. I wanted to highlight some of the more esoteric religious and magical aspects of the game, essentially giving 17 players a chance to encounter the wondrous and have an adventure. Typical play is more slice-of-life or politically-oriented maneuvering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393907/#Comment_393907" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T09:52:54+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  9:52AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see.

Time marches on.<br/><br/>Or if you have an agreement that you can take as long as you like to make your choice, then when someone takes a long time to choose people who don't find it fun need to change that arrangement explicitly or cease playing that particular game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17311/the-beautifully-railroaded-game-did-you-do-it" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17311/the-beautifully-railroaded-game-did-you-do-it" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17311/the-beautifully-railroaded-game-did-you-do-it/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17311%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17311%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
