I need some Drives for my Robin Hood game.<br/><br/>Drives are <i>shamelessly</i> copied from The Shadow Of Yesterday's Keys. They differ in two ways: they're exhausted by fulfilling them, by doing something so incredible that your work is done; and the GM can penalise you if you do something that goes against your Drive (as with Gumshoe's Drives).<br/><br/>Here's a couple. What else would be thematically appropriate for Robin Hood?<br/><br/><i>The Drive For Justice<br/>Claim 3 dots every time you protect a victim against an oppressor.<br/>Claim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if you ensure an oppressor will never threaten a victim again.<br/><br/>The Drive For Love<br/>Claim 3 dots every time you pursue or protect your love.<br/>Claim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if your love is resolved, by marriage or death.<br/><br/>The Drive For Humiliation<br/>Claim 3 dots every time you humiliate someone in authority.<br/>Claim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if you humiliate them in a way that will tarnish their name forever.</i><br/><br/>Help?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120075/#Comment_120075" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T05:49:41+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  5:49AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/robin_hood/robin_hood_one_shot.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's what I did</a>, which is probably not at all helpful, since I made it about everyone <i>but </i>Robin Hood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120081/#Comment_120081" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T06:00:13+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:00AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am assuming that the 'bad guys' have Drives as well.  Some of these ideas might work better for characters like the Sheriff of Nottingham, or Guy of Guisbourne...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Drive for Vengeance<br/>\nClaim 3 dots every time you take revenge upon a foe.<br/>\nClaim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if the form of your vengeance is the foe's death.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Drive for Power<br/>\nClaim 3 dots every time you gain political or social standing.<br/>\nClaim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if you voluntarily leave your position of authority and power.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Drive for ?Sanctity? ?Holiness?<br/>\nClaim 3 dots every time you convert a heathen or redeem a sinner.<br/>\nClaim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if you forsake the Church.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Drive for Lust<br/>\nClaim 3 dots every time you seduce an innocent.<br/>\nClaim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if you ???<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Drive for Charity<br/>\nClaim 3 dots every time you help an impoverished or downtrodden person.<br/>\nClaim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if you rob from the rich -- and keep it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Drive for Hope<br/>\nClaim 3 dots every time you inspire hope in someone without hope.<br/>\nClaim 21 dots, and abandon this drive, if by your failure you crush a hope which you raised.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, looking back over these, I realize that except for the first one, I've been using the Keys method of exhaustion rather than exhausting them by fulfilling them.  Damn.<br/>\nRather than deleting the whole thing though...<br/>\nhmmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Drive for Power could exhaust if you top out in power, but in context what does that mean?  Usurp the throne?  (Talk about a long-term goal...)<br/>\nThe Drive for ?Sanctity/Holiness? could exhaust if you become Pope, too, but that seems impractical.  Perhaps if you attain Sainthood...<br/>\nThe Drive for Lust doesn't top out at all.  For a lustful person, no matter how much they score, they always want more...  I suppose it could be scaled back:  3 dots for any debauchery, 21 dots for an act of lust with a particular object of passion.  Guy Guisbourne lusting for Maid Marian, for example.  He shouldn't get 21 dots for taking just anybody's virginity, nor should that cause him to abandon his lustful ways.  But Marian, whom he <i>obsessively</i> lusts after, is different...<br/>\nFor Charity and Hope, above, I have no idea how they could exhaust by fulfilling...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I couldn't be more useful to you, but maybe my stream-of-semi-conscious-thought will spark something for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck;<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120103/#Comment_120103" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T07:23:12+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  7:23AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure whether these are Drives or something else: England, Sherwood, King Richard.<br><br>I'd also query whether fundamental things like Drive for Justice should ever go away, especially as the result of a single success.

If you have already drawn a coin for this drive earlier in the session, you may do so again only if the group agrees that the new acquisition is more notable, significant, or dramatic than any previous acquisition you have made in the session.  This drive often does mean that the first coin a drake spends on their mastery in a session is immediately regained.<br><br>SHARED WISDOM<br>You may draw a coin to your hoard when you share knowledge that you possess with those who wish to learn it.  If you have already drawn a coin for doing so in the same session of play, you may only do so again if the group agrees that the new information is more dramatic, crucial, or relevant than any previous revelation you have made in that session.<br><br>DEFENSIVE<br>You may draw a coin to your hoard whenever you defend a fledgemate or any person, group, item, or collection that your have hoardmarked from theft or from harm (including mystical and social harm).  If you have already drawn a coin for doing so in the same session of play, you may only do so again if the group agrees that the new threat is greater than any previous such threat you have defended against in the session.<br><br>TRADITIONALIST<br>You may draw a coin to your hoard when your dragon performs or takes part in any traditional, formalized activity (such as making a pact or similar) If you have already drawn a coin for this drive earlier in the session, you may do so again only if the group agrees that the new formalized activities were more entertaining and appropriate than those which last allowed you to draw a coin.<br><br>AGREEABLE<br>You may draw a coin to your hoard when given one for fulfilling another\u2019s influence.  That is, when another player has you draw a coin meeting their influence condition, you draw two coins instead.  You may only draw an additional coin in this fashion once per scene.<br><br>STRAIGHTFORWARD<br>You may draw a coin to your hoard when you make your intentions with regard to another named character or a group as plain as possible in advance, or cut through offered distractions to get straight to the point.  This can include threats (but never hollow ones), direct proposals of mating, open offers to deal, or the like.  If you have already drawn a coin for this drive earlier in the session, you may do so again only if <i>the group agrees that your actions have pushed the pace of play towards more interesting events.</i><br><br>HELPING HANDS<br>You may draw a coin to your hoard when you make use of your followers in a way that assists the dragons in your fledge (but not when acting through your followers makes action by the players character irrelevant or unnecessary).  If you have already drawn a coin for this drive earlier in the session, you may do so again only if the group agrees that the aid was more useful in getting the fledge into the \u201cinteresting stuff\u201d, whatever that may be.<br><br>THE PLANNER<br>You may draw a coin to your hoard when you create and explain a plan to overcome some challenge that faces you or your fledge.   If you have already drawn a coin for this drive earlier in the session, you may do so again only if the group agrees that the challenge being faced in this situation is complex, dangerous, or outright important, than any previous challenge in the session. <br><br>THE SHYSTER<br>You may draw a coin to your hoard whenever you manage to convince (or apparently convince) someone that helping you is in their interests. If you have already drawn a coin for this drive earlier in the session, you may do so again only if the group agrees that the target was more opposed to agreement than any other such target.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120391/#Comment_120391" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T10:45:52+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 10:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br>\n I guess it depends on what aspect of Robin Hood you are focusing on:<br>\nRob from the rich, give to the poor<br>\nDrive of Justice<br>\n3 dots for righting a wrong<br>\n21 points for taking action that will prevent that wrong from happening again<br>\n<br>\nStop the Usurper to the throne<br>\nDrive of Legitimacy<br/>\nGain 3 dots every time you confront a wrongful order<br/>\nGain 21 dots from deposing a wrongful ruler<br/>\n<br/>\nRevenge for stolen land<br/>\nDrive of Vengence<br/>\nGain 3 points every time you act against your nemesis<br/>\nGain 21 points for defeating your nemesis<br/>\n<br/>\n  These are kind of rough off the top of my head, but I think they casn push you in the right direction, no?<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthor of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120555/#Comment_120555" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T02:50:35+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  2:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are very useful, thank you.
