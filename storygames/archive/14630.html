I want to keep this thread focussed on GM, rather than character-player style fun. I know a lot of folks get their primary fun from single character play. I just don't want this thread to be muddied up with it coming into the discussion. Okay, that having been said...<br/><br/>There are certain kinds of fun that I get from being a GM. These are the specific ones I like:<br/><br/>I get to play through the whole game, with any downtime being of my choosing<br/>I get to create/choose a starting situation and setting<br/>I have a whole lot of input on the color stuff, including genre<br/>I get to play a bunch of different characters, and I get to make up characters on the fly or pull in other NPCs ( especially if using premade adventures) and flesh them out at the drop of a hat<br/>The intensity and depth that I put into any given character I play is responsive to the interest of the other playersn<br/>I get to throw out a bunch of ideas/challenges to the other players without needing to know where they'll take them<br/>I get to play with stuff like history, offscreen events, and geography<br/>In older rulesets and "Classic" play, I get to treat mechanics as tools, not rules<br/>I have a ton of ability to move events along based on player interest, especially with tools like sceneframing/scenecutting even in older games like dungeon delves<br/><br/><br/>Great, right?<br/><br/>What I'm interested in is how to design a game that gets that kind of fun out to everybody who is playing.<br/><br/>Now, lots of SG RPGs hit some of that stuff. Some of that is mechanical, but some is also just play Best Practices.<br/><br/>Best practices are great, but in terms of text and structure, they tend to rate right up there with generic GM advice, and that's not what I'm really going for.<br/><br/>There still seems to be a lot of design emphasis on single character play though. That's great, and I can have fun with it, but I'd like to figure out how to get a design together that really spreads that stuff out to everybody.<br/><br/>I open the floor to discussion and suggestions and ponderations from the audience.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332974/#Comment_332974" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T11:24:23+00:00" title="July  3, 2011 11:24AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.lamemage.com/" rel="nofollow">Microscope</a> is all about this.<br/><br/>Everyone gets to go back and forth on a centuries-wide timespan, introducing new events and manipulating the tone/evolution of the story.<br/><br/>Of your list, it is designed to deliver on a bunch of those goals:<br/><i>I get to create/choose a starting situation and setting<br/>I have a whole lot of input on the color stuff, including genre<br/>I get to play a bunch of different characters, and I get to make up characters on the fly or pull in other NPCs ( especially if using premade adventures) and flesh them out at the drop of a hat<br/>I get to throw out a bunch of ideas to the other players without needing to know where they'll take them<br/>I get to play with stuff like history, offscreen events, and geography<br/>In older rulesets and "Classic" play, I get to treat mechanics as tools, not rules<br/>I have a ton of ability to move events along based on player interest, especially with tools like sceneframing/scenecutting even in older games like dungeon delves</i><br/><br/>What it sacrifices along the way is having consistent viewpoint characters to inhabit - ie, "what the players do."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332983/#Comment_332983" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T13:17:28+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  1:17PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://danielbayn.com/wushu/freebies.html" rel="nofollow">Wushu</a>'s narrative truth provides a lot of that.  Player's have almost as many tools as the GM.  The way it works is that players get rewarded in dice based on the details that they provide.  Getting shoved out the window can provide as many dice as kicking ass.  Details such as camera angle and dialog also add to the pool.  You are essentially paying the players to do the work for you.<br/><br/>In <a href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">Shock</a>, players rotate through antagonist and protagonist roles.

You're still working with individually owned characters, with play centering around them though.<br/><br/>When I played Archi, one of the things that was tricky was actually when I started to get interested in a quickly sketched supporting character and wanted to pursue focus on them a bit in preference to the charater I'd originally created.

A lot of GMs do things kind of like this (requesting background write-ups, asking players to create significant connections to other PCs, etc), but after looking over some FATE games (and listening to some actual play podcasts), I realized that I hadn't seen that process codified that well before.  It tells me the kinds of things the players want to see in the campaign (and in particular the kinds of opposition they want to have), AND it provides a nice way to help the PCs work together.  And because they came up with those details, the players are much more invested in the campaign, especially when they see those particular things come up.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about it is that it's something that can be done with pretty much ANY system.  I used it for the Mythic Rome game I'm currently running using Savage Worlds and I'm planning on using it again when I start running the D&amp;D campaign I've got percolating in the back of my noggin. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333016/#Comment_333016" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T22:05:26+00:00" title="July  3, 2011 10:05PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2011 10:06PM by komradebob.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had to go to work earlier, so I was a little short on explanation. Apologies.<br/><br/>First off, this thread is hitting a bunch of stuff that I've either played or heard about that did act as inspiration for this line of thinking: Games by Jason and Matthijs; Universalis; Microscope;Shock. So yeah, right there with those suggestions of things to look at.<br/><br/>Part of what got me thinking about it also was a comment that JM made in a thread about a tossaway concept he'd posited called Ogun's Heroes. He'd challenged me to Braunstein up the concept. I'd puttered with it, and counter challenged him to get 20 of his closest gamer pals together to play something based on it. His response was basically: TWENTY!?!<br/><br/>Which really wasn't a bad response. I doubt I'd be able to call 20 people together to play something based on that concept or a similarly Braunstein-y thing. Maybe 3-6 realistically. Braunsteins work, from what I can tell, for the same reason that Diplomacy with a full player set works or that bigger, multiplayer LARPs/Freeforms work.<br/><br/>Basically, they put a large number of people together playing characters/factions with competing goals and then you schmooze and compete.<br/><br/>The thing is, I'm not dead keen on either the compete or the large number of players parts of those things. <br/><br/>I do however like the large number of <i>characters</i> available and at odds.<br/><br/>I also like those characters to be available to everyone to use ( even though I assume some players will have more input on certain characters or just an affinity for seeing them in play). And to have secrets about the characters and situation open at the player level.<br/><br/>I'm just really not sure how to make that stuff work as a play event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan" title="Zachary_Donovan"><img alt="Zachary_Donovan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan">Zachary_Donovan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333018/#Comment_333018" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T22:16:58+00:00" title="July  3, 2011 10:16PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2011 10:18PM by Zachary_Donovan.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you looked at Blowback? Part of the setup is that you play two characters; it's not exactly "everyone plays all the characters and swaps them around as they see fit," but there is plenty of getting in each other's business, and the GM-fun of advancing plot-threads through unrelated characters. It involved some head-switching to play the characters effectively, and there was always the problem of what happens when two characters are working together controlled by the same player, but it might be a point to draw insight from, and one that hasn't cropped up yet.<br/><br/>my major question right now is: how generic do you want the genre, setting, situation, and theme of this game to be? It will be harder to help provide you with concrete tools to do the job if it's just "how do I make lots of people GM together in a vacuum?"<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD: Okay, on re-reading your goals and desires, I have a better idea of how generic you want things to feel.

Yes, I think I am getting you now.<br/><br/>Alright, so now I jump to: what if you gave each player a sort of "game master sheet" that quantified their respective abilities to transplant ideas into the fiction? I'm envisioning things like Wises and Circles from Burning Wheel, except that instead of being attached to a single character, they're attached to the player? I think the modularity of those mechanics might nicely support the "cutting across situations+settings+potential characters" bit.<br/><br/>The first problem I see with this technique would be that it would be difficult to assign Obstacles for a non-refereed system. I imagine this could be resolved by tying the impact of the thing to the difficulty of the roll - i.e., the more powerful and influential you want your thing to be, the higher you have to roll.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't much like that system, but it is what I springs to mind.<br/><br/>Another idea: Perhaps something a la minutiae in Shock:? You could all brainstorm a bunch of details about the world, maybe with some distributed responsibility for themes or aspects, and use those as a jumping off point? You could even have a pile of minutiae that are just characters, to give people a common pool from which to draw.<br/><br/>If you could create a trade-off that allowed players to choose between influence over the story-at-this-very-moment versus the world at large on some kind of sliding scale, I think you could get some great consensus play.<br/><br/>A problem that I keep butting up against in my own head is how to make sure everyone can play in the game all the time; in the Apocalypse World game I'm involved with right now, we just drop in and out of scenes as we feel like it. The only moments of intercharacter privacy are few and far between, and seem to exist solely as they capture the imagination of the group at large, or no one has anything to contribute.

Can we table that particular aspect for now until we can work it back into the conversation?<br/><br/>Mr. Morningstar: On a total tangent, I was thinking about a concept a while back that specifically worked ( or would work hopefully) on character non-monogamy. Of course, it was also designed mainly to help bars sell beer and help people hook up, but still. It was called Lost Episode Sitcom Karaoke, and was designed with hot-potatoing various well-known characters, hopefully leading to drunken hilarity and general social ice-breaking.<br/><br/>jdfistrom: Universalis broke my brain early on and is certainly an influence in this.<br/><br/>zachary: My ideas are kind of muddled at this point as well, and I like a number of your suggestions.<br/><br/><br/>A possibly slightly clearer example of what I'm looking at:<br/>Open Book <i>Chicago By Night</i><br/><br/>I'm going to use this old Vampire the Masquerade setting book as an example since probably a bunch of folks have read it or a similar old WW setting book. If you haven't, try to think of something similar for another game you've played. If you aren't familiar at all, these were setting books with a bunch of NPCs fleshed, various schemes already in motion, and NPCs already pointed at one another and at cross-purposes.<br/><br/>Weirdly, you almost don't need PCs or player generated characters for these things. In some ways, PCs are almost alien to the thing if you've actually delved ( as a GM would) into the thing. The NPCs themselves are ready to go, and depending upon prtrayal and developing game events, really could go  in a bunch of interesting directions.<br/><br/>If you don't know VtM at all, but you happen to know, say The Keep on the Borderlands, it's also very similar although without as much pregame character relationship deveopment/backstory. You could feasibly just take the various monsters and NPCs in that and run some kind of developing story game with no need for player generated adventurers involved.<br/><br/>So the <i>Open Book</i> part of the concept is at least partially a question I suppose of <i>How do I get this info dump of stuff spread out to the participabnts so they can see the toys they have to play with?</i><br/><br/>Okay, so now we've got this stuff, and I've magically figured out a way to spread this cool info out and open it up to everybody. Now what do I imagine play is like?<br/><br/>My thinking here is that I really like scene based play. I need someone to take hold and get characters together in places and have some jumping off points for what begins the scene. I also need people to jump in with characters that perhaps they don't own poermanently for that scene, but are ready to portray them for the time being. maybe they even need to advocate for them, Maybe they can advocate for their part in the story or just scene.<br/><br/>I also need to spread out some responsibilities and tools.<br/><br/>And I want the holders of those tools to switch around, but I'm not so sure I want them to be in simple rotation. Amend that, I know I don't want simple rotation. Instead, I want folks to have some say in what tools/responsibilities they have during each story chunk ( scene+non-scene game related stuff) while encouraging them to , over the course of play, use different toolsets/responsibility combos.<br/><br/>Basically, even if I'm starting out with a bit of disassociation between players and characters, I don't want things to evolve down to a level where some people are almost exclusively playing a single character and others are mostly taking up GM type duties. I want it to move around more than that.<br/><br/>And, getting back from an Open Book existing game module to a more <i>Story Game Let's create stuff together mentality</i>, I'm a slo trying to figure out when and how during the course of play to work in non-scene brainstorming, situation/setting/story evolution periods ( and mental rest periods).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333220/#Comment_333220" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:58:44+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:58PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Mr.Corley: I do think that is a relevent aspect, and I think that some of the things I mentioned about liking being a GM in my original list touch on  similar points of enjoyment.
