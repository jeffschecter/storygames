In addition to all of that, there's a new, revised system chapter that offers smoother gameplay and more guidances for participants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's internal artwork by Stuart Beel (SLA Industries, Changeling, Werewolf and many other RPGs and CCGs ) and Paul Bourne (3:16, a|state, Hot War, Piledrivers &amp; Powerbombs), offering a great visual experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nCold City v1.1 allows you to create games all about hidden agendas, trust and monster hunting in the gradually recovering city of Berlin in the year 1950. Working for the secretive Reserve Police Agency, the characters must confront the needs of the nations they respresent, while trying to carry out their arduous, horrific tasks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraise for the original version of Cold City:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>"Supernatural investigators in Cold War Berlin. I totally want to play this. Proof that you can come out of left field with a setting idea and still maintain clarity of concept." - Robin D Laws, creator of 'Over The Edge', 'Feng Shui' and 'The Dying Earth RPG'<br/>\n<br/>\n"It's a wonderful book, allowing the players to explore the darkness that engulfs the horror-filled streets of post-Nazi Berlin, while exploring the nature of the own group and characters as well." - Jeramy Ware, 2007 ENWorld-Gen Con 'ENnie' Awards judge</i><br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who own the original books, there's no need to rush out and buy this new version.
