We're in Clapham, near Clapham Common tube station, and meet on Wednesday evenings.<br/><br/>We tend to play either indie games, Trail of Cthulhu or sometimes Dungeons and Dragons. There's a lot of Cthulhu. Recently, we've played Ganakagok and Misspent Youth. We're now playing Sign In Stranger.<br/><br/>There's me, GBSteve, Simon and Mysterious Dave. I'm the youngest and I'm 36, so if you're more than about ten years younger than me, you should probably find kids your own age to play with. We cook quite nice food and might give you some if you ask nicely.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234966/#Comment_234966" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T00:36:36+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 12:36AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a city the size of London, we (those who enjoy indie games rather than those who are about 40) seem few and far between. I'm in Forest Hill, and game fortnightly with a couple of lads down in Croydon who I've been trying to gently hippy-fy for a while to no avail. Burning Wheel, a one-off DiTV and a couple of games of Inspectres is about as far as I can get them from their comfort zone, and I can only dream of getting a game of HoTB, Cold City/Hot War, BE, Sorcerer etc going.<br/>\n[Relatively] House-trained.<br/>\nWill game for food.<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
