Feel free to look into my motivations and ideas surrounding the selection of games/setup/etc in these two threads:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13491" rel="nofollow">The Initial Idea</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13558" rel="nofollow">The Followup</a><br/><br/><b>When:</b> From NOW until February 15th. 6 weeks. That should be more than enough time to learn the rules and organize a session.<br/><br/><b>Details:</b> "The (Story Games? Andy?) RPG Club". Play at least one session of one game (more if you can/want to), then discuss the results here.<br/>Half the effort is organizing and engaging in play. The other half is discussing with others what you did/didn't like about the game, how your session went, etc.<br/>STEP ONE: Locate/Purchase the game.<br/>STEP TWO: Play the game, at least once.<br/>STEP THREE: Start discussion of the game in a new thread.<br/>(I imagine a single "RPG Book Club: [GAME NAME]" thread per game, where people go in and post their thoughts, before or after they actually play the game)<br/>STEP FOUR (optional): If you had fun, keep playing.<br/>STEP FIVE (very optional): Review the game in its own "The Game Report" (category) thread.<br/><br/>This cycle, I'm starting off by introducing two games, pick one to play of the two. If you want to, feel free to get/play both, but don't feel that it's a requirement: It will not prove you hardcore (though you're welcome to try). I'm just testing the waters here with a for-pay vs a free game. Please choose one of the following games for you and your group:<br/><br/><b>METROPOLE LUXURY COFFIN</b><br/>( <a href="http://www.thefreerpgblog.com/2010/12/bury-yourself-in-metropole-luxury.html" rel="nofollow">FreeRPGBlog link</a> )<br/>( <a href="http://www.story-games.com/goodies/MLC_01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Direct download link</a> )<br/><br/>or<br/><br/><b>ANNALISE</b><br/>( <a href="http://www.findannalise.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.findannalise.com/</a> )<br/><br/>If you're going to participate (as GM or player even) please post in this thread a tap-in.<br/><br/>If you plan to hack/modify/houserule the game or whatever... The intention here is that you play the game as raw as possible, but if you want to tinker ("...with LIGHTSABERS!"), that's up to you: But please post in the eventual discussion thread how you are changing the game up, and why.<br/><br/>Bonus: Later on, either at the end of the year, or if this play-focused activity just sputters and dies in a few months, I'm going to come up with some sort of award for participation. So, the three or so folks who participate the most in these group events (through play, discussion, thoughtfulness, enthusiasm, etc; to be determined quite qualitatively) will be getting a prize of some kind to be determined later (likely a gift certificate to Amazon or IPR). <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306899/#Comment_306899" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T08:17:35+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  8:17AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm a-tappin' in.

Here are my thoughts.  This is cross-posted - <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/10294169#39319989" rel="nofollow">http://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/10294169#39319989</a><br/><br/>Man, there's a lot to love about Annalise.<br/><br/>The active-player / story-guide thing is a pretty traditional player / GM breakdown - the player gets to feel immersed on their turn and the story-guide gets to do some old-schoolish GMing, which feels comfortable. Maybe that's trad gamer brain damage talking, but I like it.<br/><br/>Claims: this is awesome. As audience, I'm totally involved, listening to narration details and seizing upon them. And it did encourage recurring motifs - for example, we had - unnatural cold, vodka, shadows. And when I was narrating I was consciously adding details for others to claim if they so desired. <br/><br/>When to go to the dice is very clear, and once we'd done a few conflicts we started getting pretty quick at it. It feels like recent games have been moving away from otherkindish/shockish orthogonal good stuff + bad stuff but I still really like it - when the bad stuff doesn't happen, I don't feel like it was a waste of time to define - I feel like that risk or danger was part of the fiction. "Whew."<br/><br/>Secrets - although they didn't come up in play much for us I thought they were really cool, as a way of taking our characters in a direction we didn't anticipate, kind of like "Play it as it lies" character rolling in D&amp;D or Gamma World. I was gay, and so I was overly protective of one of my male friends; Cy killed a man, so he narrated himself having a gun. <br/><br/>Some questionable stuff:<br/><br/>We didn't know what to do about PvP. When it came up we all agreed that our characters could be treated as the story guide's NPCs when we were involved in Moments - a couple of us had Consequences that were *We get in a fight / get angry with the active player.* Even though it meant we lost control of our characters for a bit.<br/><br/>Just start playing, after only defining a vulnerability. I'm reminded of what JM said in Fiasco, about how you should bring your situation into focus before you start play, otherwise it'll be directionless &amp; dull. But this seemed to work pretty well - our introductions were pretty short and to the point, and our play felt like the first act of a movie, where we're still learning who the characters are and what's going on. And it was still fun - the conflict system is just fun all by itself.<br/><br/>There's very little pushing us to move the story forward, except advice.<br/><br/>And its fatal flaw, for me:<br/><br/>It's not a one-shot. After three &amp; a half hours of play we felt like we were about halfway done. I realize this is As Designed but I pretty much only play pickup games. <br/><br/>We went present day, Detroit - we were all workers at the GM plant and union members.<br/><br/>Our scenes:<br/>1) Vinnie gets busted by the cops.<br/>2) Uncle Bruno doesn't want to help Vinnie but is forced to by his wife, so he bails Vinnie out.<br/>3) Vitaly takes Vinnie's shift at work. (earlier)<br/>4) Vinnie's house is a mess - they go to Uncle Bruno's to get a tarp and Greta invites Vinnie to spend the night and Uncle Bruno gets pissed.<br/>5) Uncle Bruno follows co-workers into the "crack house" which is actually the lair of the vampire, realizes something spooky is going on, and escapes with Sanchez but leaves Danny.<br/>6) Vitaly followed the same co-workers, but snuck in the back, and has a conversation with the vampire - turns out the vampire is from Siberia also, which hits Vitaly's vulnerability (he only gets along with russians)<br/>We prematurely thought it would be a good idea to switch to Act 3 here:<br/>7) Uncle Bruno is freaking out about the crack house so Vinnie goes to check it out and meets the vampire and finds Danny, dead and drained, and the vampire's ancient Siberian treasure. The vampire asks Vinnie to do something stupid which hits Vinnie's vulnerability (crippling lack of foresight.)<br/><br/>Maybe it could be hacked for a one-shot...something like:<br/>* Setting is always present day and vampire is always "classic vampire" so you don't have to spend a lot of time discussing setting &amp; genre details. (I think part of the reason Fiasco plays fast is because it's usually present day and you don't spend time working out "and there's these islands floating in space and a tribe of minotaurs lives in the forest"...) You pick a city and you're good to go.<br/>* Start the players with 7 coins to split between secret &amp; vulnerability instead of 13.<br/>* Only allow one Moment per scene.<br/>* Only have 2 PC's - with 3 or 4 players, the third and fourth player are always storyguides. (Like we do with Polaris. This effectively turns it into a GM'd game...)<br/>* Have a stricter act structure:<br/>= Introductions<br/>= First round of Foundations: you must hint at the Vampire.<br/>= Second round of Foundations: you must establish a relationship with the Vampire.<br/>By the end of this you'll have 2 and only 2 satellite traits, one on vulnerability and one on secret...which doesn't make a lot of sense with the game economy - you'd be incented to spend all your core trait on your one satellite trait. Maybe the satellite trait is just a detail that further defines your core trait, but you don't actually get to invest any coins in it, much like in Smallville how you add a sentence of description to your relationships and values. You still need to be able to flip those traits though, I'm not sure how that would work mechanically.<br/>= Two rounds of Confrontation. If you haven't given in by the end of two rounds, you "win".<br/>= Epilogues.<br/>* The story guide is instructed to play antagonism hard - try to exhaust the active player's resources. (And now there's no conflict-of-interest because the story guide doesn't have his own PC he wants to protect.)<br/><br/>With 2 PC's, that would be 2 intros, 8 scenes, and 2 epilogues - and the scenes would be shorter because of the 1 moment rule. <br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308191/#Comment_308191" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T10:42:21+00:00" title="January 14, 2011 10:42AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game does come with five or so pre-gen scenarios that skip the set-up phase and are meant to work as one-shots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308198/#Comment_308198" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T11:04:10+00:00" title="January 14, 2011 11:04AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ignotus</cite>The game does come with five or so pre-gen scenarios that skip the set-up phase and are meant to work as one-shots.</blockquote>\nI have trouble believing they would work as one-shots either.

And yet, I don't want folks to grudge-fuck the players through a session to meet a quota.<br/><br/>Also, I had hoped to throw in a bizarro one every now and then (Everway, Rifts, etc) as an alternate choice, but honestly I think I need to step away from the Contest mindset, too deep in that game from Game Chef. In other words...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>but there might be something to be said for democratizing the selection.</blockquote>\n...yeah, I think that's a good point. In the end, that's kinda how real book clubs do their thing anyway, a mashup between leadership and democracy in choosing the Next Book.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>In retrospect, Annalise probably wasn't right for one-shots.</blockquote>\nYeah, the idea was at least one session, with more if interest continues. 2 months might make a better period for multi-session play for those who want to pursue it.<br/><br/>I think I've got an idea then for how I want to proceed with the next round (we'll see how it goes):<br/><br/>1) Official play time is 6 weeks, with 2 weeks of "downtime". Downtime lets the stragglers finish up and post, it allows for further discussion on the open threads, and gives people time to decide which game they want to play next.<br/><br/>2) On the start of that 2 weeks of downtime (so this month, around the 15th/16th), we'll call for submissions/suggestions for the next round. I'll pick one of the people who participated the previous round to make the final selection or selections. We might try the "pick one of the two games", with perhaps one game of their choosing and one game crowdsourced.<br/><br/>More feedback if folks have it, plz. I'll post the next thread for the next round in a week or so once this round has ended.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311598/#Comment_311598" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T00:39:54+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 12:39AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with the idea that Annalise isn't great for one-shots.

We SHOULD be playing MLC tomorrow night... but it might snow, and I've only got one person RSVPing for it on the Meetup (not that that was any indication for the first Meetup two weeks ago).<br/><br/>As for selection... I don't know, really. Some democracy would be good, but I think leadership (or, more precisely, experience/exposure) is more important. Otherwise, there's no discovery and folks will settle into popularity mode (i.e. we'll be the equivalent of Oprah's Book Club). But I also have a budget to keep, so TOO many "rare and unheard-of" games will make me balk, just because I have to buy to try (but see "experience/exposure" above, again: assured GREAT games as selections would mitigate the fear of paying for junk).<br/><br/>I would maybe wait another round or two before retooling the concept much, though. You have a sample size of one, with a test period set during a generally busy time, commitment-wise, for a lot of folks (return to classes, tax season, etc). In 2 x 8 weeks, it will be a sunny summer day, with breaks and vacations impending, and maybe your participant pool will go up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312234/#Comment_312234" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-11T11:31:57+00:00" title="February 11, 2011 11:31AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, didn't get to play--only Joey and I showed for the meetup.

I used to work 60-80 hour work weeks and still had to spend my weekends catching up on other work, and I played more games then than I do now. It's getting buy-in for a specific game at a specific time that can be hard.
