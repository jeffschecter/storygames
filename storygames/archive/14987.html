You've forgotten because everyone underestimates the purple oozy ones. <br/><br/>I bought CAPES before GPNW and read it all the way through, but due to its complexity I still had no idea how to play. Word got around after Fabricated Realities that Seth ran a great one-shot of it, so I made sure to jump on that. <br/><br/>He brought everything and explained the basics to the four of us. We spent a little time figuring out our past conflicts with each other, which added some juiciness to the scene we ended up playing. We were each given a full color postcard with a graphical representation of the rules that he and his girlfriend had created. It\u2019s apparent that he has spent time refining the rules to be introduced and played in a 3-4 hour slot. I had a blast and I think I mastered enough of the basics to give a longer campaign with all the rules a shot. <br/><br/>If you are having any trouble figuring out how to play CAPES I recommend tracking down Seth and having him run his polished one-shot for you. If you can\u2019t find him at a con, whisper me for his house address and candid photos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
