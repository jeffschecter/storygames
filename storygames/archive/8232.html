One of the example goals is for Celanawe.  His goal is to get his thieving opponents to reveal what they've done with his axe.<br/>\n<br/>\nPage 114 says you win the Conflict you achieve the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThing is...Celanawe's opponents...never stole the axe...never had the axe...and IIRC at the time in the comic on which this example is based, had no idea where the axe was.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did Celanawe won?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some hippy game...Celanawe's player would have just established that his opponents were indeed the theives who stole his axe...but this is a BW design so eff that choice straight away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince it IS a BW design, my channel-Luke-Crane powerz tells me that Celanawe wins exactly nothing -- the price of his player selecting a dumb ass goal.  The player would have been better off with the goal "my opponents tell me everything they know about the axe".  or just "my opponents tell me the truth about why they're here" or what have you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that seems rather disatisfying since game text examples should be understood to represent examples of GOOD play unless otherwise stated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes a good Arguement Goal?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181281/#Comment_181281" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T22:37:22+00:00" title="December  2, 2008 10:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Celanawe lost that conflict.

He has won is what he wanted "what have they done with his axe?"  The answer is "nothing" and he learns that.<br><br>Maybe he sees in their eyes or hears in their voice that they are telling the truth.

You changed the player's perception of his own character - which can lead to terrific and powerful moments, but it can also mean that you turned his beloved noble knight into a swine in his eyes.

Well, then that is implied agreement to such interpretations, but it still feels a bit like the GM here gets to create the worst possible interpretation of your victory.  It seems like failure is a open bag for pulling drama and complication from, but victory can be antagonistically interpreted like this as well?  Does that lead to the D&amp;D "wish problem" in phrasing goals?  Also, I guess this where the "I always have..." statements help, right?  "I always put myself in the other guy's shoes." might mitigate the cruelty (but choosing this mean that is something you care about at the core).

The point can still hold, however, if you ignore the importance of the role of table chatter. Its possible for a GM to narrate a player's failure in a way that violates any number of things, ruins any number of things, etc, etc, etc. That only works in so much as the GM isn't ruling from context, and isn't listening to what people at the table are saying to him. <br/><br/>Like, if Luke had made that call and I'd been the player, and I'd said "Luke, that's bullshit" and everyone else at the table had been like, "No, Brand, its awesome" then I'd probably swallow it. But if I said "Luke, that's bullshit" and everyone else at the table had been like "total bullshit" then Luke could stand by it, by the letter of the law, but would he? As a GM I probably wouldn't. But sometimes I might. <br/><br/>Stuff like that is do dependent on the group, the table, and the moment that while we do need to have good rules about it (which this game does) the truth of the awesome will usually come from the table chatter. Which is the best thing in the whole fucking book so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181554/#Comment_181554" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T12:04:15+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 12:04PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would be interested to get a better sense of how this kind of thing is implemented by various Burning Wheel GMs.  In the one session I played with Luke (several years back now), he seemed to really push for that edge where players are really passionate about what's going on, but not so upset that they say "fuck this" and tune out, flip out, or walk away.  I remember being really upset about the stuff that was going down in the game, but I was also really engaged and endeavored to try to change things in character, through the medium of play, even if I was ultimately unsuccessful.  That was also the only game I can remember in which I full-volume screamed at somebody (also in character).  However, I can imagine that different GMs and groups have different levels of comfort and experience at walking that line between bullshit that is awesome and social contract-breaking bullshit that harms relationships, and, rightly, tabletalk does a lot to help you work your way through borderline cases or moments of confusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181952/#Comment_181952" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T10:07:15+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 10:07AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question of curiousity:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is Being Tired recovered from using Health and Being Sick recovered from using Will.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat immediatley struck me as backwards, but I'm sure there's a reason for it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181953/#Comment_181953" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T10:18:39+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 10:18AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a question on Improving Resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn page 228 the Clean the Slate rules indicate that if a score is depleted all of the accumulated advancement tests are lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nPage 238 indicates that instead of the normal Twist and Condition rules, you can use a special Condition for Resource Tests and deplete the Resource score.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last line on this page confuses me "After Depletion, resources can be advanced as normal."<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that mean that Resources are immune to the Clean the Slate rules?

I get Ob 7.<br/>\nBees:  drones, workers, bees, hive.  That's 4 for Hive<br/>\nProduct:  N/A<br/>\nAction:  placate, anger, swarm.  That's 3 for Swarm.<br/>\n7 Ob seems pretty steep for an action that any player is going to think of doing with the Apiarist skill<br/>\n<br/>\nA Baker wants to bake some bread for their patrol.  I get Ob 4<br/>\nMaterials:  Milled Grains, Harvested Seeds, Foraged Materials.  I'll say the baker has already processed flour, so thats 1 for Milled Grain<br/>\nBreadth:  One, two, a patrol, a household, a bakery.  That's 3 for a patrol<br/>\n4 Ob is described as being very hard, requiring teamwork and needing a bit of luck to succeed.  I'm no baker, but I bet I could manage to bake 1 loaf of bread to feed 4 people without needing much luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Potter wants to make a large jug to hold drinking water.  I get Ob 5, which seems pretty high for a routine pottery task<br/>\nTo store: dry, liquid.  Thats 2 for liquid<br/>\nType:  simple, functional, pretty.  I only did 1 for simple, but I'm not sure what the difference functional would mean.<br/>\nSize:  small, large, bulk.  Thats 2 for size.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Gwendolyn wanted to put Lockhaven on emergency rations due to famine or siege I get ob 11!<br/>\nType:  report, budget, law, rationing.  I get 4 for rationing.<br/>\nBreadth:  mouse, patrol, outpost, business, neighborhood, town, city.  I get 7 for city.<br/>\nNow Gwen has Admin 5, could probably snag both of her wises, would hopefully be helped by 6 Guard Captains, and likely would have some inventory and consumption reports so maybe a die or 2 for gear so could conceivably get to 15 dice.  Her Nature's only 4 so even tapping that means she's likely to fail.  But still, the list says ob 6 is extreme and rare so ob 11 seems way big.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that's what struck me as I was reading through.  The obs I was getting didn't seem to match the list on page 231.  In fact, if I was picking an ob just using that list as a guide...I would have selected obs pretty much exactly 1/2 of what the Factor method was putting out...which motivated me to ask the question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182533/#Comment_182533" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T21:53:39+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:53PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apiarist.

If you're not a master apiarist with assistants and a high Nature, perhaps you should swarm the drones?<br/>\n<br/>\nBaker. I dunno. Kitting out your patrol with baked goods isn't just single loaf of bread.<br/>\n<br/>\nPotter. If the look of the thing isn't important, I'd leave out type, but you're still going to quibble with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmin. Putting a whole city on rations is just begging for a twist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not parcel those single tests out into multiple tests and situations? Sounds much more interesting to me to look at an Ob, realize it's too hard, so you formulate a plan to do it in parts.

Whatever the answer is, is cool with me, I just wanted appropriate expectations.  It would seem that the list of obstacle descriptions are from the point of view of what an ordinary mouse would experience in their daily lives.  Guard Mice should expect to spend more time in the 5-7 range than the 2-4 range.  That's cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just means that nearly every time they make a test they better have helping dice flying and lots of tapping natures and spending Fate and Persona points...which is cool, but a different flow of play then if the obs were routinely 3 where there's at least a chance of going solo and saving the resources for something bigger.

You have 3 poor tenderpaws tending the bellows in shifts, apprentices beating the dough with mice sized quarterstaves, built like micey-wrestlers from the effort.  <br><br>Sure, the dough goes in at mice sized proportions and comes out at the right size, but imagine how carefully they have to time it- it's the size of a fucking cheese nip or a skittle- leave it in too long and you've got a blackened hard loaf to munch on.<br><br>Teams of mice pull the whole pan out (gotta bake'em all at once for it to even be worth the effort) and the head chef screams, "This is Spartaaaaa!"<br><br>...<br><br>What?  Mouse Guard is a hard, hard world.
