Each issue has a common theme with six cool feature articles, including new mechanics, scenarios, settings, game hacks, and even mini-games.<br/><br/>This first issue's theme will be Blood &amp; Treasure, and I've got some excellent creators interested, including Jonathan Walton's Uncharted + A/W hack.<br/><br/>Sixgun supports all kinds of RPGs, from traditional to indie games and more. You can even help pick which favorite games it features.<br/><br/>To make this all happen, I need your support.<br/><br/>Please pledge to\xa0Sixgun\xa0at <a href="http://www.patreon.com/sixgun" rel="nofollow">Patreon.com/sixgun</a>.\xa0The way Patreon works lets you support\xa0Sixgun\xa0very much like a magazine subscription.
