Now let me explain what I mean.<br/><br/>I've written many articles in many fora. They're very rarely edited.<br/><br/>See, when I send stuff to RPG.net, they basically publish what I write. I had a review sent back once, with a paragraph explaining it wasn't up to their standards; I rewrote the whole thing, sent it back, got it published. Other than that, I've never heard from an editor. When I write for fanzines, well, you know how that works.<br/><br/>However, I recently submitted an article to the Solmukohta (also known as Knutepunkt) book for 2008. It was half-baked; now it's fully baked. What happened was this - short version:<br/><br/>Me: "Here's my article, go publish!"<br/>They: "We're not sure this should be in the book."<br/>Me: "WHAT??? It TOTALLY should! Can't you see that (such and such)?"<br/>They: "Well, maybe. Write that in the article and we'll look at it again."<br/>Me: Grumble grumble... "Here. Now is it good enough for you?"<br/>They: "Oh sure, it's very promising! If you rewrite this half, add something about this, fix these references, explain what you mean here, say more about this, cut some of this crap, it's probably something we can publish!"<br/>Me: Oh well. "Here. How about this?"<br/>They: "Oh yes, we'll definitely publish this! After you make these changes here and here and here."<br/><br/>The thing is that by the third exchange, I was so heavily invested that I'd rewrite it almost any number of times to make it good enough. I had something to live up to. There was someone who A) was in a position to say "Not Good Enough. Do it again", and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> cared enough to do it five times in a row.<br/><br/>THAT's what editing is. That's the major advantage of somebody else publishing your article, or book, or game. They have the power to say "no". <br/><br/>The disadvantage of indie publishing is that nobody has the power to say "no" to you. Nobody can tell you "we're not publishing this unless you work on it some more". And if you want a writer to perform at their very best, you need somebody with that power.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128961/#Comment_128961" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T03:50:19+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  3:50AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They can, though, say "I'm not buying that unless you work on it more" assuming, of course, that they see it first                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128962/#Comment_128962" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T03:59:14+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  3:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're talking about potential customers, right?

I had totally convinced myself that the game was 'done' when it was only really starting. It was a classic schoolboy error of the highest magnitude.

They want me to succeed, they don't want me to embarass myself, so they drive me to make the best thing I can. Find yourselves some utter utter UTTER bastards like these and let them go at your text.

When I dared to suggest to someone via email that I didn't think Solipsist was necessarily the best thing in the universe ever (though it was as good as I could make it for what it was) and that maybe some people would like it and others wouldn't ... he was shocked speechless!<br><br>Personally I don't think there is anything wrong with acknowledging that your game may not be perfect or for everyone, that's healthy realism. You should strive to make it as good as it can be for what it is and what you can do, but you can't let a lack of total objective perfection stop you from finishing. I see some games that I suspect will never be finished, because the authors are striving after that illusion of perfection.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128976/#Comment_128976" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T05:28:18+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  5:28AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>The vast majority of those aren't going to see your text before publication.</blockquote>\nThat's a good point. However, I have learned of a number of independent game designers whose game text is made available for free online. Admittedly, in many cases, these games are available through retail channels, so a potential customer might run across such a game on a store shelf and make the purchase, never knowing that such a preview existed on the web. However, in other cases, these games are only available through the designer's web site, ensuring that the purchaser will at least be informed enough to choose whether to read the text first before clicking the buy button.<br><br>This minor point aside, I agree with what you're saying. It's the risk faced by other small-press publications, such as vanity-press novels. These books are not scrutinized or edited by major (or minor) publishers, and the resulting gold-to-dross ratio can be disappointing. In the case of RPGs, few such publishers exist (it's not like you can submit your game to White Wolf or WOTC and wait for an acceptance letter, after all), so the water is muddied by the fact that most of us, regardless of budget, are vanity publishers in a way (insomuch as we finance all printing costs on our own, rather than simply creating text and forwarding it to a publishing entity for approval).<br><br>Neil, damn good point. I agree that if you have access to anyone with red-ink skills, turning them loose on your manuscript can save you a lot of grief down the line.<br><br>-- Rafael                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129004/#Comment_129004" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T07:19:08+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  7:19AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's inherent in the model that prevents people form using an editor?

I once draw a children book as both author and artist. The projet came from the editor, not me, but the constraints were both strict and very loose : this size, this number of page, no words, only images, children this age with that, do what you want.<br/><br/>It was my first book (and still my only one to this day) and I was very intimidated. So, I made some sketches, showed them to the editor. Then we had a discussion, he advised me of some weak points, we spoke about children, art, films, books, etc... I redraw some pictures and that was all.<br/><br/>I my case, meeting this man was very important. He is a man with a vast culture, able to see a potential even in a work he's not familiar with and very open. Yet he also had a vision of the kind of books he wanted to publish. This vision was kind of an artistic or esthetic vision of its own even if I was the artist on this precise book.<br/>This was a great experience, a great meeting. I learned a lot.<br/><br/>BUT<br/><br/>I thought that the point of indie publishing (in a given support or expression) was precisely NOT to have this last vision, the one of the editor, come from a different person than the author of the words, pictures, games, music whatever... Even to point of risking to be too personnal.<br/>And quality is not even at stake because you can have peer reviews, public reviews, editors, etc... even in the indie model as people said.<br/><br/>I don't object to your point. I just find it great that parallel to the traditional model of edition, a very personnal and unadulterated vision could come to bear fruit and become a game, a comics, etc... Without that we could never have something as Acts of evil from Paul Czege, Epileptic from David B. and such great works.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Antoine                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129032/#Comment_129032" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T08:21:13+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  8:21AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Antoine,<br/><br/>You're hitting the nail on the head, I think.

Maybe we can debate how good their editors are, but all of them have editors*.<br/><br/>* It occurs to me that some pedantry might be in order.

The editing in the RPG world is pretty shocking in general. Even the big companies produce some horribly inconsistent text, bloated writing and poorly structured content. I used to read WW Chronicles and they are full of stuff like NPCs using powers they didn't have on their sheets or lacked the stats to use, basic cross-referencing checks.<br/><br/>Even if the editor can say no to poor content, stuff still gets through because in a larger publishing context you may need to get stuff out the door to maintain your revenue. Because X is the new hawtness and a book on that would sell well right now.

I think NOT having that someone be an authority with true control is vital to the very concept of being an indie-publisher.  However, resolving this paradox requires nothing more complicated than the designer being willing and...i don't know...strong? enough to grant someone they know and respect (and who has taste and talent in this regard) that kind of position and then voluntarily abide by it.<br/><br/>Right now I'm playtesting Blood Red Sands with a group that includes game designer and publisher Keith Sears, game designer and publisher Seth Ben-Ezra and Seth's gamer wife (whose also doing the layout) and sister.  These are people who know what a good playable solid design looks and plays like.  There's no doubt in my mind that if I say "Awesome, lets get this ready for Gen-Con" and some combination of them give me the frowny look and are like "no way this is ready for GenCon" or "hey, this has been fun, but I wouldn't spend money on it"...then it ain't going to GenCon ('cept maybe to the Ashcan Front).  <br/><br/>I mean, I know that sounds simplistic, but I think if the group you playtest with understands that part of the job of a playtester is to serve as that "not-ready-for-prime-time" gate-keeper, AND the designer voluntarily keeps the gate closed...it can be just that simple.<br/><br/>But then I'm the guy whose still working on Robots &amp; Rapiers after  years, because 6 months before I was scheduled to release it playtesting showed "this game ain't fun to play".  Thankfully, now it is and I just have to find time to finish it up and get the rest of it to my editor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129182/#Comment_129182" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T11:28:47+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:28AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>However, resolving this paradox requires nothing more complicated than the designer being willing and...i don't know...strong? enough to grant someone they know and respect (and who has taste and talent in this regard) that kind of position and then voluntarily abide by it.</blockquote>\nThe designer will always know that they have the option to say "what the heck, I'll just publish it anyway".

Here's what's unspoken, because of said rapport means it's highly unlikely to happen with the two of us:  They're allowed to do that.  I'm allowed to leave.  It's not as binary as I make it sound, but if it happens often, it could be that I'm totally the wrong editor for someone (or they aren't the right publisher-writer for me).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>It works well for two reasons:<br/>1.

But my honest experience with good mainstream RPG editors in the past couple of years has been that they helped me write the book I wanted to write, rather than the book I didn't. <br/><br/>When Ken Cliffe edited my copy for Second Sight, there were six different places in which his only comment was a variation on "What is this shit? You are better then this, don't be so lazy." And every time he put that there, he was right. Every time I rewrote one of those sections, it was better after than before. By the time we finished what went to press was more what I had wanted in the first place than what I'd written down my first time through. My big complaint about it is that because we were under crunch, we didn't get enough iterations of it. If Ken and I had gone through it half a dozen more times the damn thing might have been perfect. <br/><br/>Thor, up there, sounds like a good editor. I wouldn't mind working and fighting with him. <br/><br/>Ken Cliffe was a good editor. I'd work with him again, even though I know he's gonna call me a lazy get. <br/><br/>I love a good editor, because they let me write what I actually wanted to write but didn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129538/#Comment_129538" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T18:30:29+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Buzz, what I mean is an editor with the power to deny you publication. </blockquote>\nThe ideal state is to find an editor who will be a partner in your work.

It's the production editor, the person like Thor and Ryan who understands how to write well and who works with the author to improve the writing quality of the work. That's what Matthijs is talking about, as well as Neil, Brand, and Tony - at least as far as the writing itself is concerned. (Quality control on the game design is important too, but isn't necessarily something the (writing) production editor would or should handle; in terms of a specific role, that's more of a managing/line editor task.) <br/><br/>(* The spelling and grammar check features of Microsoft Word are a nice starting point, but they are not reliable - particularly the grammar checker. You do need someone to act as a copy editor and proofread your text for the basics. But a text can meet all the requirements of spelling and grammar, and still be an unreadable, unclear mess. That's what a production editor is for, to help you shape your unreadable and unclear mess into a clear and concise explanation of your game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129651/#Comment_129651" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T04:46:02+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  4:46AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 4:51AM by Eric.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jack, it seems like self-publishing hobbyists working without quality control are producing material that isn't up to best-in-business professional standards.
