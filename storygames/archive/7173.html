This is not a function of the game itself, though: I did it in With Great Power, I'm doing it now with L5R. And it's happening naturally, as well. But I think that the game Sorcerer, and the idea to let the players go off their separate ways and do separate things - for <i>entire sessions or campaigns</i>* - Was where I picked up the idea.<br/><br/>* Note: I can't recall the book specifically saying this, I think it was from a conversation based on how I was "Playing Sorcerer Wrong" from years ago.**<br/>** But it's a default style of playing that game, which I learned in that conversation, and carried into other games.<br/><br/>Also, it only works for me in games where the players play more than one role. They might only have one character sheet, but multiple roles.<br/><br/>Frex, in my L5R game, the group of 3 players is split up: Travis, for the last 5 sessions, has been wandering on his own in the far south, finding his destiny. Quintin and Matthew have been elsewhere, wandering together to hunt down an evil sorceress.<br/><br/>When it's time for Travis' scenes, Quintin and Matthew play the roles of a companion ashigaru young warrior, and a noble Crane swordsman with amnesia (neither of which have character sheets, just Travis).<br/><br/>When it's time for Quintin's scenes, it's often that Matthew's character is there. And Travis and I (GM) play the roles of memorable area NPCs. When Matthew and Quintin split up, then the other also plays memorable area NPCs.<br/><br/>If it was just one player and the GM roleplaying, while the others sat on their thumbs, I'd find that really boring.<br/><br/>Also, yeah I like stories where heroes end up saving the motherfucking world. And I've done that with everything from D&amp;D, TSOY, Savage Worlds, Primetime Adventures, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159746/#Comment_159746" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T07:07:08+00:00" title="July 30, 2008  7:07AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like sacrifice stories, too.

At the end of the tale (or at key points within it) you look back across the scope of the protagonist's journey, and you almost can't imagine them as the same wide-eyed shmuck of Chapter 1, yet the whole transformation makes sense.<br/><br/>I like this in an unarticulable <i>felt</i> sense, but also in an analytical, <i>thinking</i> sense: it's about seeing what a character is made of, imagining how differently or similarly you might respond yourself, and either reveling in the "hell yeah" of the indecisive wretch growing a spine, or wallowing in the *sniff sniff* tragedy of the plucky idealist losing all hope. Or, y'know, a million other feelings for a million other flavors of feeling.<br/><br/>Some favorite examples:<br/><br/>Dune, Lord of the Rings, Fight Club, Star Wars, the first two Terminators, Earthsea, Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy (mainly the 4th book), anime like Trigun, Macross, Gundam. . .and a dozen others, Harry Potter, V for Vendetta, new Battlestar Galactica, and Marvel Comics' Civil War before they flinched and fucked it all up.<br/><br/>What games handle this well? Let's see, <b>Shadow of Yesterday</b> is <i>made</i> for this with Keys and Buyoffs--it might as well be called the Character Transformation Engine. And <b>Heroquest</b> is great since players develop traits for every aspect of a character, including beliefs, personality, and relationship. So while sure, you can level up in Swordsmanship, you can also level up in Devotion to Brother, or Compassion, or Vengeance, or whatever. <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b> is a particularly dedicated app for this sort of narrative, taking young and fresh characters full of hopes and convictions and asking them an ever-severely gut-punching "Oh, reeeeeally?" And finally <b>Capes,</b> while not enforcing permanent transformation <i>per se</i>, does a great job of challenging a player and character: "Oh, you stand for Justice? Hah!

On the same level I find stories about love interesting; the supportive and transforming love.<br/><br/>And then I like the stories that tells life from birth to death, showing us how it can all be and showing us how the life-changing choices may influence our destiny. The drama that gives us a birds view of our life on earth is very, very interesting (and educating).<br/><br/>But my best game for stories, is a game that tells no stories at all, kind of. I made it myself back in 1989, the rpg <b>Muu</b>, a game about small beings with no language that lives under a tree in a glen in the forest. That game tells no story, it is more like a meditation over the simple life of <i>muu </i>and <i>allmuu</i>; the sleeping, bathing, eating, hugging and sleeping again ... It is a game that time and again has left the players in a smiling state of harmony.

Characterized by  relentless forward motion and breathless energy, an "out of the frying pan into the fire" progression with last-minute improbable victory, and fun, memorable characters with witty repartee. It can be deep, or not, but it must be exciting!<br/><br/>Examples: Star Wars, Indiana Jones, some Hellboy stories, Pirates of the Caribbean, Some Discworld books (most of the Rincewind ones), Back to the Future III, the Princess Bride, parts of Thieves and Kings, movie versions of the Three Musketeers.<br/><br/>Looking over the list it seems a fairly common element is one or more protagonists with fantastic power or awesome potential, but who doesn't quite know what he's doing (Hellboy's "hit it till it drops" MO, Jack Sparrow's "make it up as I go" craziness, Indy's perennial strategy of "avoid deathtraps, punch Nazis," etc).<br/><br/>So, what games? I never got to play it, but <b>Star Wars D6</b> seems built for this, especially with the Wild Die (when things go wrong, they sometimes go REALLY wrong, when things go right, they STILL sometimes go wrong). <b>Heroquest</b> works great, because death's usually off the table so spectacular failure is a real and non-gamekilling possibility. <b>Shadow of Yesterday</b> is good for the same reason. And I don't yet own it, but reading the SRD and people's commentary it looks like <b>Spirit of the Century</b> would be a dream for this kind of play, with lots of Aspect-tagging like "Dangling off the Edge of a Tank," "Foot caught in Tank Treads, etc. And <b>Capes</b> has some fun elements for this, with over the top stunts and stunning reversals, more a seesaw approach to conflict than the more common "slow grind" model. While it doesn't predictably produce the "things get worse and worse and worse and then suddenly better" result, it produces it often enough to keep things interesting.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS.

Knights in shining armor, I guess. I <em>love</em> Harry Dresden stories--the man is just basically a seriously decent, stand-up guy. Also pretty much all the detective novels of Samuel MacDonald.</p>\n<p>A lot of games can do this; I'd even say that it's one of the default narratives of RPGs. I particularly like PDQ, as I've found it in <em>Dead Inside</em>, though. Though I was inspired to read MacDonald by the <em>Sorcerer</em> bibliography, I don't know that I've seen a game with specific support for the laconic-yet-transparent hero; done in normal RPGs, he's something of a bore to play, IME.</p>\n<p>I love with a heartsick longing stories where the good guys beat guns, bombs, and most of all, <em>hate</em> armed only with the power in their hearts. (Shut up over there. I'm serious.) Some fairy tales, with the mystical power granted to the pure of heart, approach this. I know of no "grown-up" modern literature that does it. Interestingly, although it's an obviously moving narrative, I have seen it only in nonfiction. <em>A Force More Powerful</em>, the documentary of historical episodes of successful nonviolent struggle, is a great overview, and it makes me sniffle <em>every time</em>.</p>\n<p>I'm still working on a game that might be able to do this. <em>Dead Inside</em> is the only game I have yet seen where it's something near to being the focus. Games that operate on story currency rather than a more simulation-minded setup (even if they are full-on Gamist!) can enable this kind of play too, if other players are also on board.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163083/#Comment_163083" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T16:49:19+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  4:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm watching this thread with interest as the whole point of my Pentasystem is to simulate, not reality, but fictionality - i.e., stories, and a particular kind of stories, which are the kind I like.<br/><br/>That is, stories where the protagonists are defined by, drawn into conflict by, and empowered by what they care about, and where you can win against impossible odds if you're willing to bear the cost. <br/><br/>And Harry Dresden is explicitly an influence.
