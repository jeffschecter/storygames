It wasn't exactly a spectacular event, but I (we) persevered until I was kind of surprised in the evaluation phase.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started by setting a scene in a foggy and damp Ghostworld, but the players didn't get on board. They asked tangentical stuff (over and over) and couldn't quite get on board with the game. When the Wraith-dogs came howling, one PC curled into a ball and they really didn't get the "you're vital members of a crew - and possess vital skills". Also, they were more fond of inventing foibles for eachother than ascertain a cool and competent characters. Most dug into the system, though, except the one who got a decent character and threw a man-whole at the dogs. He didn't get the system though, so it all stalled as we meticously went through it. It seemed like everyone liked the system, at least - and while the characters seemed more silly than competent they got on the way and after the dogs were a non-issue the quest for Jack the Ripper's scalpel became something they haphazardously pursued. I was left to pretty much build 80%-90% of the setting myself, which was difficult, as the first time I played, - we the players ran away with characters, setting and system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey got into the Scalpel though, and we established that the priveliged masses (aka the few) payed large sums for items of historical value that could survive leaving the ghost world. Half-way, after we had walked the dog, I asked if they wanted to go after Crane, and one said it would be cool and suddenly everyone was on board. As mentioned, they really dug into the system, and we even had a rules-argument(!) I really struggled to not 'block' victories/successes, and they "struggled" with the "roll for conflict, not task". They were also very 'protective', so it was difficult to find decent flow in the story (mistakes).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe characters were: <br/>\n<br/>\nCoil - a slick suited wall-street bastard, the man with the plans. "People think he's an asshole, and he is."  When we got the the real world he wore khaki, shades and sandals. Yes they really dug into the "you don't have to look alike in both worlds"...::)<br/>\n<br/>\nHull - the man with the real plans, as the player set up an antagonistic situation with Coils player. He was the one that harvested the small seeds from Coils suppsed ramblings. He was really interested in having the Mad Hatter's (a wraith.hawk) top hat, maybe because he hadn't any cool clothes himself. A sack perfectly packed with every item one could need.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrip - looked like "Love-sausage" from the comic "the Boys" (for us that don't know, he's a big, bearded russian). The player did the accent and ideom splendidly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDemon - got stuck as the unvoluntarily leader, but the player had a back-story. A big debt, a great big mission (JtR's scalpel) and a newly formed m\xf6tley crew. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearned: <br/>\n<br/>\n1st time I played, we had green dice for goals and red dice for 'bad stuff'. Now I used one shaded dice, as I gathered from the game text.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really struggled with the 'conditions', and lot's of 3s and 4s meant the stuck around for a really long time. <br/>\n<br/>\n"bad position" were really difficult to deal with, often I made them walk into a prepared antagonist (Crane)<br/>\n<br/>\nbeeing injured wasn't so bad as it could be, I'm not sure if I should have rolled immediately, as I often did? How do people use 'taking harm'?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, somehow they suddenly got their goal, with lot's of conditions hanging around. When I first played, it was really tense when our team leader rolled and had to either kill me or make the guy who carried our loot incapacitated... now, nothing, though one player had two "suffer harm" and one "incapacitated" in from of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did learn that the conditions are best used on the induviduals that brought them, my question is: Should everyone roll something when they get attacked?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe suprise:<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered everyone to do their own epilogues, but they declined. What was fun is that everyone said straight up, after I've thanked them for the game, that "it would  be fun to run a 2nd time", now that everyone understood it - and were more aboard the premise. Actually, they really wanted to iron out the premise before they got to play. They apparently really liked the system(!!) - they currently play Exalted (and am tempting me with Earthdawn, curse the long way!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
