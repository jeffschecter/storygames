There are several builds a hero can choose from, specialising in the usual rpg types: combat, social, stealthy/shadowy, etc. I don't intend for there to be a thousand and one choices because of a) analysis paralysis and b) it's way too much work. <br/><br/>In creating this character type I amd stuck on how to make it unique. If the player is merely presented with a list of abilities to choose from, then what makes this character type unique? I can't think of a way to represent genetic modification in an interesting way. The simplest way is for PC's to acquire E5 to power their abilities, but this isn't Vampire - it's not a resource acquired by killing people. It's a rare resource in the setting used in the process of genetic modification. That unfortunately makes it somewhat mundane (unlike drinking blood which, while macabre, creates the kind of narrative that Vampire thrives on). Also having to periodically acquire this stuff will just put players off - it's not fun if every other session the player has to go through a process to acquire the resource to make his character fun to play.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434680/#Comment_434680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T02:19:46+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  2:19AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of making the alchemical process a resource-hunting issue, make it an internal system of integration and growth (as historical alchemical systems have been, and as a wuxia alchemy should be). Alchemical heroes do not need more Element 5 because they already produce it themselves, as part of the continuous process that brews in their gut ever since it was began by the initial injections. The challenge - and choice - for such heroes is internal in a not-wholly-spiritual way, as the continuous, unstable alchemical process moves forward relentlessly, taking them from humanity to superhumanity, or subhumanity, or some sort of stable plateau.<br/><br/>In practice you break your ideas for alchemical super powers into building blocks of which beginning alchemical heroes get a couple to begin with. After regular intervals the character's internal alchemy produces more, depending on what they already have, and what manner of internal alchemical balances the player opts to emphasize. This is a semi-controlled process that might involve a special diet, meditation and whatever, dice rolls included. Successful control means that the player gets to choose which alchemical building blocks to integrate next, while with failure they get random alchemical processes occurring within them instead.<br/><br/>Ideally a wuxia hero of alchemical bend will be able to avoid "plateauing" into a stable state where all of the Element 5 in their body gets tied down in unreactive specific processes and compounds. These "plateaus" are specific, named fantasy critter archetypes basically, recognized from prior alchemical hero experiments. Perhaps roughly 4% of all alchemicals grow wings and stultify at that stage, for example. Character to which such happens are basically no longer open-potential alchemics, but will from then on have to forge their heroic destiny as wookies or whatever sort of critter it is they stabilize as.<br/><br/>However, keeping the process on-going is not without its risks either, even if it is the only way to achieve the true goal of alchemy, the absolute immortality: as long as the Element 5 yet brews within, there is always the danger of uncontrolled mutation and unwanted change that is capable of transforming the foolish and weak into most lively awfulnesses. Rampant cancerous growths are the most mundane of such possibilities; even more dangerous are ill-fated cyclic processes that destroy or mutate the internal regulatory organs - such as the brain - that the alchemic hero uses to hold onto their humanity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434681/#Comment_434681" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T02:36:34+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  2:36AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That would prbably be the best/easiest solution.

Maybe they've sold their supply to fend off starvation, and now the PCs need to decide whether to punish them in accordance with the Law.

However i'm not sure you can effectivley tie narrative ideas - like adventures (with no guarantee it will work out for the pc's) - to PC needs, such as mechanics. What happens when the adventure goes awry and they can't get what they need? It screws the PC over fundamentally. Also it kinda makes every adventure revolve around E5 regardless of the other PC's involved otherwise the Alchemic doesn't get what he needs. You could give him enough to tide him over to the next time, but that means he has a huge amount of the resource to use - and every possibility he might use it all and run out necessitating another trip into the E5 narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434689/#Comment_434689" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T07:34:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  7:34AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>i'm not sure you can effectivley tie narrative ideas - like adventures (with no guarantee it will work out for the pc's) - to PC needs, such as mechanics.

If you're going to condition a PC's abilities on certain behaviour (such as gathering a resource), then it either feeds into the narrative, in which case you need to balance mechanical issues and story goals; or it doesn't, in which case it's going to be boring to everyone except the player involved, and possibly to that player as well. (I mean narratively boring; it could still be interesting from other viewpoints: visual appeal, optimization, etc.)<br/><br/>(Incidentally, In my experience blood in Vampire falls largely into the second category - gathering it is generally boring, and therefore usually ignored.)<br/><br/>The trick would be for the GM to understand when E5 needs to be straightforwardly available, and when to make an issue of it. Even if only one out of ten adventures threaten the Alchemic's supply, that's more than enough to make the E5 economy a defining feature of the class.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434696/#Comment_434696" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T07:59:17+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  7:59AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks, but I have to say that is emphatically not what I'm going for.

It makes a great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borax" rel="nofollow">detergent</a>.<br/><br/>Kidding aside, I like the idea of using it like Apocalypse World Dungeon World handles ammo; let's say you have X 'supply' of e5; as long as you have at least 1 you can use your powers, otherwise you can't. A character can only carry a set amout (maybe as they 'level up' they can carry more)<br/><br/>On a partial success you can choose to 1) fail, 2) take a complication, or 3) consume 1 "supply" of e3. A full success doesn't deplete your supply (we assume the PC is always using it in small amounts, but doesn't 'use up' his/her supply on hand). This way the player never depletes their supply unless they choose to, they can always choose to fail a roll to preserve their supply (reflected in the fiction as their depleting reserves are causing them to be less effective).<br/><br/>As for gathering, you could make gathering the e5 the same for all classes, but each type of alchemist her has a different <i>refining</i> process; different power sets need a different refinement of e5.  One guy distills it into potions he drinks, another creates batteries that power his tech, another grinds it to powder that she uses as a reagent for her spells, etc.<br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434719/#Comment_434719" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T13:30:08+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  1:30PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is still the problem of acquiring resources, as well as what happens if the player rolls a lot of fails and eats through his supply (rightly or wrongly - it's his decision).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434720/#Comment_434720" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T13:31:12+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  1:31PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Incidentally, In my experience blood in Vampire falls largely into the second category - gathering it is generally boring, and therefore usually ignored.)<br/><br/></blockquote>\nYes I think that's most people's experience.

Otherwise it's not actually a meaningful resource. Here are a couple of ways you make it meaningful without making the game revolve around gathering Element 5 or severely handicapping Alchemic Heroes:\n<ol>\n<li>The ability to stockpile large quantities of Element 5. e.g. the setting should allow for plenty of enemy stockpiles, veins, giant mutant beasts with hearts of Element 5--anything the PCs can go after as a quest. Large treasure rewards should contain it. Alchemic Heroes should also be able to hold on to large quantities of Element 5 once they acquire it--if they're capped at a small quantity, they'll need to refresh often.</li>\n<li>Have a low-friction way to get small quantities of Element 5. Maybe the setting bad guys or some monsters have small quantities of Element 5 in their blood, which can be extracted by someone with the skill. You can get back enough for one use or half-use in the time it would take to skin a beast, or take several hours to get a few uses worth. Higher skill means better returns.</li>\n<li>Allow Alchemic Heroes to recover some of the Element 5 they used recently instead of health. Alternatively, if they're out of Element 5, let them spend health to fuel low-level abilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> means that adventuring with an Alchemic Hero makes Element 5 important, but in an interesting, situation-generating way. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> give the Alchemic Hero a way to limp along between jackpots if they blew all their Element 5. They make Element 5 management similar in scale to D&amp;D wizard spells/day management.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434889/#Comment_434889" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T22:07:28+00:00" title="July  5, 2014 10:07PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'all are wasting your <i>qi</i> posting in this thread. ghostwhistler is a troll who rejects every single one of the perfectly reasonable suggestions people make to him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434890/#Comment_434890" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T22:28:45+00:00" title="July  5, 2014 10:28PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's not a very nice thing to say.

Maybe lack of Element 5 could have interesting effects instead of merely shutting down powers, too - like, perhaps E5 <i>inhibits</i> the sorts of alchemical processes I speculated about earlier instead of pushing them along, and thus running out of the Element risks having your character devolve all Hulk-like, or maybe <i>evolve</i> into something. Nobody knows, because the usual outcome is a horrifying mix of drug withdrawal sickness, instinctive violence and runaway cancerous processes that ultimately make the body non-viable.<br/><br/>The dynamic here would then be more like a D&amp;D Paladin than a Vampire vampire, except instead of just losing your powers there's a proactive danger to defying the divine authority. The default assumption would, however, be that you work for the government, good or ill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434942/#Comment_434942" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T11:03:15+00:00" title="July  7, 2014 11:03AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's idea is cool.

It will become their 'hit point' statistic possibly with some wrinles. But i don't think making it volatile is workable or desirable.

It's that the economy works on a completely different system. <br/><br/>The problem you have is that this still falls into the same problem as resource gathering in general: it's simply not interesting. Regardless how rare you make it or how difficult refining it for use may be. All that does is mean the hero either gathers what he needs to make his character playable or he doesn't and that's not a fun challange to play IMO. If I played VGampire and I couldn't get blood my game experience would be curtailed - even if the narrative reasons are interesting or awesome, it just limits what I can do for no real gain. This might be ok on rare story occasions, but when it's the essence of the character's mechanics it becomes tedious and off putting.

The e5 in their bodies stores the energy needed to fuel their special abilities, so they burn E5 to use them, but regain it after a rest like anybody. However, if they get access to more E5, it's like having an extra battery fo fuel their powers, or a quicker way to regain them instead of resting for a while to recharge their e5 (the boring way)<br/>Having access to more e5 can even make them more powerful, so it becomes a good idea to go looking for more.<br/><br/>So players can either go get more E5 through adventuring, as a reward for missions or just rest a bit if they are more focused on another aspects of the story. There's no need to "hunt" everyday, but when you care to do it, you get more powerful.

Nobody knows how to make more of it.<br/>- Large concentrations of E5 warp the area around them, causing strange phenomena.<br/>- It's considered inherently evil and everyone tries to avoid it.<br/>- It's sentient, possibly in the form of a galactic hivemind.

Even though the actual options (the specific spells/effects/abilities) aren't terribly exciting, the character options are flexible and compatible enough to allow a variety of concepts. Not focussing on specific kungfu abilities (like Legends of the Wuling for example) works better. But the concepts - a character can learn to fight, use Taoist Magic, alchemy, excorcism - are not mutually exclusive. <br/><br/>My problem is that each type in my game is just that. They are as follows:<br/><br/>Alchemic Hero (as above - genetically modified).<br/>Wu Engineer (has kungfu cybernetics and is connected to Tian, where the 'gods' live - the great Ancestral Intellects).<br/>Enlightened Robot (possesses enlightened cicruits given to him by other Enlightened Robots who inherited them from the first of their kind, connected by a device known as the Shao Link).<br/>Dragon Shaman (essentially a psychic whoses powers come from hyperspace, channelled via Trigrams).<br/>Ghost Constable (galactic vigilante powered by the souls of evil doers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435510/#Comment_435510" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-20T02:52:59+00:00" title="July 20, 2014  2:52AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why is the exclusiveness a problem? I ask because to me it would look like a feature, forcing character concept clarity.<br/><br/>Perhaps you could have both the clarity of the exclusive classes as well as the uniqueness of freely mismatched characters by defining one more character type whose shtick is generality; a "Freebooter" class or some such. (Owns a starjunk, has seen it all.) Maybe such a type of character would possess the necessary personal and interpersonal qualities that would allow them to dabble in all the cult secrets of the other character classes a little bit. Like, instead of being an enlightened robot, perhaps they carry around an AI companion module, and so on.<br/><br/>Alternatively, or in addition, you could finesse the construction of each of those character types to define for each of them a "lesser" and a "greater" initiation, such that while individual characters can only really possess the qualities of one greater initiation (if you're a robot, you can't be a shaman, and so on), they still could pick up a lesser subset of the abilities of another character type via the lesser initiation. Sort of like multiclassing in 4th edition D&amp;D, you know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435511/#Comment_435511" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-20T03:12:05+00:00" title="July 20, 2014  3:12AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2014 3:12AM by ghostwhistler.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem is that each class has its own idiosyncracies, abilities, perks, etc. That makes the job of design a lot harder - and the job of the player/GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435513/#Comment_435513" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-20T05:05:26+00:00" title="July 20, 2014  5:05AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think a freebooter class could work.

For example, that sort of dabbler character could equip special circuits not himself, but rather into something he carries with him intimately. This "something" could be exclusive, highly illegal and expensive, making it unfeasible for everybody and their aunt. Think Mother Box of the New Gods, if you will <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Of course that's neither here or there regarding your actual problem of class idiosyncracy and the resulting maintenance difficulties. For that part, I can only say that when I build similarly highly complex games (The Shadow of Yesterday, various D&amp;D variants come to mind), I manage the complexity and maintenance work by making the game chassis itself clean and powerful, so that all the various special rules and idiosyncracies can be made to hang off a system that takes care of much of the balancing and such without any further worries from the designer, GM or player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435533/#Comment_435533" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T00:17:38+00:00" title="July 21, 2014 12:17AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The setting needs to stand on its own in terms of not being too obviously contrived as a vehicle for a game.
