To sort of explain what I mean by aware with a comparison, a lot of story games I have (like DitV, et al) seem very aware of themselves in that the design goals seem more transparent.<br/><br/>So when I pick up a more traditional type RPG, one with a strong GM, Rule Zero, and all that, these days I'm looking for one that "knows what it is" if you get my drift. Some of these games make design assumptions that are unspoken and it sometimes drives me nuts - why does a traditional RPG designed and published in 2008 sometimes still look like something from the mid-90's?<br/><br/>I should give an example of a trad game that I think pushes the envelope a bit - Weapons of the Gods is one. I'm not sure about it's level of "self-awareness" (I have to go back and look at it) but the Lore Sheets is a pretty neat idea that I hadn't seen before, and it builds more group interaction into the game.<br/><br/>This is an idea that's hard for me to express - can people think of recently published traditional-type RPGs that are actually doing something new and building on and incorporating advances in design, and not just doing the same thing everyone did back in the 90's?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125480/#Comment_125480" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T03:58:27+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  3:58AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the problem is that, outside our community of dirty hippies, analysis of games and awareness of the underlying are actively frowned upon, even as far as thinking that once you know, you'll never have fun again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125486/#Comment_125486" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T05:06:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  5:06AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The various Gumshoe games, especially Trail of Cthulhu, do new stuff.

The same goes for a lot of Malhavoc's stuff too (Arcana Unearthed, Arcana Evolved, Iron Heroes, etc.).<br/><br/>The loresheets in Weapons of the Gods were written by Rebecca Sean Borgstrom, who wrote Nobilis, which explains why they're so progressive.  Her work on Exalted too is really visionary, especially Exalted: The Fair Folk, which is just... out of this world.  She switches the normal combat attributes for these underused emotional stats called Virtues, creating Shaping Combat, which is basically a battle of wits where each side tries to describe a story in which their opponent suffers unfortunate setbacks.  And that's not the least of it.  Probably one of the weirdest things White Wolf has ever published.<br/><br/>Speaking of White Wolf, some people saw the road-to-humanization in Promethean: The Created as a nod to progressive stuff like Keys in The Shadow of Yesterday, but I'm not sure, since 1) I'm not that familiar with the game and 2) when I was flipping through it, it didn't seem all that progressive.<br/><br/>Some mainstream games have seemed intent on stripping themselves of any progressive leanings in subsequent editions.  I think Ars Magica is the most common suspect here.  I was one of the first games to promote troupe-style play, but that continues to be de-emphasized.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125499/#Comment_125499" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T07:01:55+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  7:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like there's a little of that self-awareness in D&amp;D4, from what I've read.

You pick a Nature, which says the sort of person your character is, and then get a Willpower point each time your character goes and fulfills their nature.  I mean, there are distinctions which make Keys cooler, don't get me wrong. But still, it's <i>a player-chosen reward mechanic</i>, right there at the top of the character sheet of a fairly popular set of RPGs that I think most would consider pretty text-book "trad".<br/><br/>And it's also, perhaps tellingly, one of bits of the rules that was most often forgotten or ignored (at least in my experience playing and running the system back in high school and college).

Dramatic Conflicts, iirc, arose out of a need to provide for definitive resolution of various genre-appropriate conflicts in tournament play. In a way, this is basically parallel evolution (system matters, actual play matters), which I think is pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125528/#Comment_125528" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T10:09:32+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 10:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>M&amp;M 2nd is certainly a great game, but I don't see it doing anything that HERO hasn't done - it's just simpler and better put together.</blockquote>\nFor sake of argument, Storn Cook once opined in a thread over on the Forge that it's M&amp;M's Hero Points, not d20, that are at the core of the system.

Some sort of hero point mechanic seems pretty common in mainstream games to me.<br/><br/>If you're just referring to how quickly the points are exchanged, the games I've played in and run haven't worked that way.  It's not like FATE where I'm spending and earning tokens left and right and driving the game forward.  A lot of folk tend to hold out until they get hit so they don't sit there incapacitated all day, or so they can resist mind control, or otherwise protect their hero.  Same thing for Action Points in Eberron and other attempts to provide a mechanic like that in d20 - folk want to guard against the randomness of the d20.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125535/#Comment_125535" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T10:48:30+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 10:48AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2008 10:52AM by Mike Montesa.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm glad there are some traditional "mainstream" games that are pushing things a bit, intentionally or unintentionally (which seems to be prevalent enough) whether or not their designers ever heard of the Forge and all that (buzz: interesting anecdote about Spycraft 2.0)<br/><br/>Personally, I think a game's level of self awareness, no matter what sort it is, trad, story, whatever has a huge impact. Some of these trad games I've seen recently (no names, because I don't want this thread to be about them) could have benefited greatly from a little more awareness of just what they were about and what they were trying to do. In one case I think there were some real missed opportunities to produce a state of the art traditional-type RPG and the end result was more scattershot and 90's style than some would admit.<br/><br/>I think a trad game designed with full awareness of what it is could really be something special, though I have yet to see anything like that (though I may have missed something out there already, which is why I'm bringing it up).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125559/#Comment_125559" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T12:55:01+00:00" title="February 10, 2008 12:55PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it's hard to find a trad game with the sensibilities you are looking for because a game with that sort of self-analysis is seldom trad?

But imagine such a game where the designer wrote in Rule Zero, the GM Creates the Story, and the GM's Word is Law not simply because that's just the way it is, but as an informed design choice that was well aware of alternative schools of thought on the issue, aware of what it would mean in terms of actual play, and then designed the game to play to the strengths of such assumptions (which kinda sounds like what happened with Spycraft 2.0 mentioned above). Several of the newer trad games I'm seeing still do the former ("We do it that way because that's just how it is, isn't it? Why are you even asking?") The result in those cases is much of the same rules disconnect, faulty assumptions, and lack of coherency/focus/completeness that caused peoples' dissatisfaction with such things in the first place. <br/><br/>Those such games that I actually did buy, in hopes of seeing something new (or at least, showing that they knew what they were about), were disappointing (to me anyway) that the designers still seemed to be blissfully unaware of what the design assumptions they made for their games would mean in actual play.<br/><br/>Also, do you think that "a trad game with that sort of self-analysis is seldom trad" (paraphrasing a bit) is then incapable of being self aware? In that case, such games might be forever stuck in the 90's. Not being combative here, just trying to draw this out some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125602/#Comment_125602" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T14:58:01+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  2:58PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess what I meant was that a large, background-rich, task resolution driven game with self-awareness of this level might not be sufficiently trad for people to count it as such (see the comment about calling Gumshoe 'trad' above). The self-analysis required to meet the criterion inevitably changes the tone in which the game is presented and that might make it non-trad.<br/><br/>On the other hand its certainly possible for a game to be rule-zero, GM led, task heavy etc. and have done it for a conscious set of reasons. I'm looking at an RPG for ex-D&amp;D playing adults plus children who have never RP'd outside of a forum as a spin off from my virtual pet game and I think it would present adventuring in that style for very deliberate and self-conscious reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125629/#Comment_125629" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T17:21:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  5:21PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2008 3:32AM by Malcolm Sheppard.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, y'all could actually ask how traditional games are designed and about the choices that go into those designs instead of tossing hypotheses into the big empty. <br/><br/>Mainstream games are not driven by an abtract desire for novelty along one axis or agenda. Their designers do not derive social rewards from talking about game design on the Internet. These games the result of complex design choices that not only consider an overall artistic direction, but how it will change in the face of various player approaches. Some mainstream games use literary techniques that aren't a part of the corpus of theory here; most are designed to support multiple play modes simultaneously.<br/><br/>The assumptions being tossed about around this thread are very, very wrong, but I wonder if there's any real desire to find out about these things.

I always found the WW books to have the most material about playing and running the game in them, and for that style of play, I found it to be pretty fair advice too. Now that I think about it, I've got every edition of Vampire on the shelf, so a comparison of their GM advice sections could be interesting, just to see how it developed and changed. This is probably going to lead to me looking at bunch of my other old 90's games and then trying to run some of them again, but hey that's what it's all about. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125645/#Comment_125645" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T19:00:32+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  7:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite><br/>Somewhat recently I realized that WW has actually been doing stuff quite a bit like Keys for a while now: The "Nature" mechanic that was in pretty much every oWoD game and the first edition of Exalted (I haven't seen the Second Edition yet, don't know if it carried over). You pick a Nature, which says the sort of person your character is, and then get a Willpower point each time your character goes and fulfills their nature.  I mean, there are distinctions which make Keys cooler, don't get me wrong.

Different ways to get rewards for different characters were very common from the '70s  (at the top of my hat I remember the different cults in Runequest, for example) and even AD&amp;D 2nd edition had them (only rogues got xp from money stolen, for example). Nothing "revolutionary" about that.<br/><br/>Keeping in mind that tSoY isn't so much a ground-breaking game as a "refine these ideas" one (you could call it a easy and nice road that make easy traveling where once only difficult trails marked by rough explorers went), I would say that the Key are not "revolutionary" by their existence, but by the fact that they can (and should) be cashed, and changed, many times during the course of the game.

I didn't have the opportunity to take as much time as I wanted. I inundated Eric Boyd with notes on style and organization and left it to him to incorporate what he wanted. Unfortunately I haven't had the time to do this again because I'm usually very busy.

It's also interesting to compare to other, previous Star Wars games (including the D6 versions).   <br/><br/>In terms of envelope pushing, it starts looking at the power selections and breaking them up into different categories- siloing them in a more useful fashion.   The "Condition Track" also provides this great parallel way of tracking damage that adds some interesting tactics in play- you can focus on doing more HP damage or disabling foes and figuring out what's going to work best for you, without the 20-odd types of conditions you normally see (Sickened, Exhausted, etc.)<br/><br/>There's a lot of neat stuff with Force Points and Destiny Points, the latter of which work as Flags and give a lot more power to players than most D20 games do in terms of "meta game" currency.   All the stuff on tracking where you go to the Dark Side is less brutal than a lot of previous games.<br/><br/>Artesia is an interesting design I want to get a chance to play, to see how it works.  The big innovative push is that there are 22 reward tracks- based on the Tarot.  Each type of points has different award conditions and things you can spend them on, which means as long as you're doing -something- your character is getting points.   The unwieldy-ness of this I imagine can only be handled by splitting up the reward task amongst the players, but I'm more interested in what that does in terms of long term play- what -kinds- of behaviors do you get to buff up what scores?

They have other standards of which, say, Forge theory might not be aware, of which they are fully conscious. <br/><br/>(Though, for the record, there are a lot of games out there without a clue. However, I dunno that I could shoehorn them all into one school or area of design.

Certainly the Big Two. A number of the 2nd-tier publishers have a single auteur (or small circle) who exercises a pretty strong hand as well, which can be good or bad.<br/><br/>Are more "mainstream games" adopting Dirty Hippie ideas and priorities ... well, a few, maybe, and mostly by parallel development than through direct influence. <br/><br/>Is the "state of the art" in design better now than it was in 1998, and in 1988? Almost certainly. The segmentation of the hobby into genres and styles alone would have accomplished that. Add to that more designers who have diverse play backgrounds and connections - as opposed to the more "garage style" path based on a single play community's experience that dominated 1st and 2nd generation RPG design - and you definitely see more genuine innovation and fewer "heartbreakers." With the exception of a few games whose market is almost exclusively conservative "grognard" types who won't tolerate much innovation, games in general are evolving faster and faster.<br/><br/>What Malcolm is talking about is absolutely true, by the way. The priorities in developing games that are part of an existing line, intended to compete directly for "traditional gaming" mindshare, a revision of a prior property, or most importantly as <b>work for hire</b>, are driven by some very different concerns than what we tend to focus on as "design." They need to maintain continuity with prior art, be familiar and not TOO innovative to a largely conservative, low-patience-for-reading-the-rules audience that expects NOT to play a game particularly closely to "as written," and present a consistent "house style", among many other considerations that just don't particularly apply to small-press games or games not aimed at the "mainstream gamer."<br/><br/>On the other hand, most of us Dirty Hippies aren't particularly interested in designing/playing under that particular set of constraints. Which doesn't mean they don't matter or there's nothing to be learned from them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125769/#Comment_125769" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T09:47:21+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  9:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To get back to the original post...<br/><br/>Mike: What would _you_ like to see in a traddy set up? <br/><br/>Personally, I think the concept of "GM-as-entertainer with audience participation" has bunch of potential that isn't being tapped, not to mention a lack of well thought out rules that support that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125772/#Comment_125772" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T09:50:27+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  9:50AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually think some of White Wolf's most innovative work recently has been in the realm of "gameline design," starting with Orpheus, Demon, the end of the oWoD, the way the second edition of Exalted has supplements organized, the specialized one-year games for the new WoD like Promethean &amp; Changeling, and Scion.  This is an area that indie games don't usually deal with at all, because we don't do supplements, for the most part.  I've got several pages written on this for an article that's on the backburner (maybe Push 2?), but it's definitely something that I keep an eye on.  It's interesting to see mainstream companies planning out gamelines with fixed endings nowadays, instead of having them all be open-ended, lasting as long as the books keep selling.  <br/><br/>Aside from a few one-shot offshoot books, every supplement for Exalted 2 was planned before the first one was released, it seems.  That's a pretty interesting development.  It makes me wonder what will happen when they run out of planned books.  Will they launch straight into another edition?  Will they end the setting in an apocalyptic mass of flames, with the Empress' Return, as has long been hinted at?  In the article I was writing, I was predicting that Scion would end with a book that contained information on ending the entire setting in a cataclysmic fashion (like the old WoD, which is something that only WW does, as far as I know: ending entire settings).  I thought this would be in Scion: God, but then Scion: Ragnarok got announced.  That made me kinda happy, even though I don't follow or play the game, just the way the gameline is planned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125779/#Comment_125779" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T10:32:10+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 10:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strikes me as a neat middle ground between the "supplement treadmill" and the oft-decried "one and done" nature of a lot of small press games.

Central to all of these was the basic cast-a-spell power trait, which was called Gnosis, then Arete again for a while, and then Gnosis once more. That trait, along with the magic system in general, was changed several times to support not just particular crunch effects like how you would set some dude on fire, but the symbolism Gnosis would have in play. For a while, Gnosis was straight-up good, to the point where it was briefly Arete again and was a measurement of human excellence, so mages were "overpeople" in fact, as well as self-opinion. At one point, Gnosis side effects were more severe, symbolizing the opposition of a hostile cosmology (and at one point, the cosmology was *very* hostile, to nearly Kult proportions). Playtesting and the desire to give players more flexibility in defining the meaning of Mage-hood led to a subtler set of effects. At one point I argued for a complex system balancing Gnosis and Wisdom, but (like many of the things I proposed), it was too complex to use.<br/><br/>So in this case, you have several iterations of design devoted to seeing how a trait supported story goals and the kind of message it gave by operating a certain way -- but *also* (and this is where commercial games differ from many indie stream designed) ways for GMs and players to conceptualize alternative meanings. This ends of being incredibly rewarding for other parts of the game, too, because we can talk about in-world groups' reactions to the way game systems work. So we have the Guardians of the Veil's quasi-religion telling them that magic means a certain thing, and the Silver Ladder saying another.<br/><br/>However, this kind of thing doesn't have a high profile on reading, because it's not meant to operate that way. It *plays*  certain way, but nobody really grandstands about how it all works to impress you with the Big Ideas. We do our best to make sure that the virtues of it come out in play. Certainly, it's in the nature of hype-driven online discussion to talk about whatever is immediately chucked in your face about something. If the game did that with Gnosis, there would probably be pressure to make Gnosis a but more radical in its effects, but that doesn't do it for playing. That puts a lot of the setting narrative or high-concept parts a bit more front and centre, but that's not necessarily where the design and development efforts are going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125787/#Comment_125787" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T10:56:07+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 10:56AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what I really appreciate, when I look back on games from the nineties that don't seem to know they were made in the nineties, instead designing for the naughties.<br/><br/>1993 - <b>Underground</b>. Containing specific rules to empower the players to come up with their own goals (the example they give is "eliminate the AIDS problem in Los Angeles county"), and to figure out how to tackle the issue by altering the current state of society. The players suggest storylines that will allow them to change the social landscape (examples given: break into the Super Bowl transmission in order to raise education levels, or help an honest investor take over a crooked corporation in order to raise wealth levels). It has stats for where society is now along seven parameters, and where they have to end up for the desired change to happen.<br/><br/>1994 Mind's Eye Theatre <b>The Masquerade</b> (2nd Edition). Conflict resolution. Right there on page 83, player A wants to hit player B, player B wants to escape. If player A wins during the resolution mechanics, their goal happens, if player B wins, their goal happens (and the loser loses whatever resource they bid). I know I know it's a LARP, but the rules in this game work just as well for TT. I'd also point at the Influence rules, that give players a mechanical way to be all intrigue-y (something that for me was really lacking in the actual VtM rules).<br/><br/>1996 <b>Dragonlance Fifth Age</b>. The players are the only ones who engage the resolution mechanics. You want to hit someone? Roll to hit. You want to not be hit? Roll to avoid being hit. The GM never engages the resolution mechanics. Also, no real advancement (your attributes and skills (such as they are) do not improve over time, although you do get more competent). Finally, during random character creation (that I swear is totally fun, seriously, I could sit around making Fifth Age characters all day), you are mechanically encouraged to be a good guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125794/#Comment_125794" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T11:04:51+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 11:04AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><br/><br/>Is the "state of the art" in design better now than it was in 1998, and in 1988?</blockquote>\nI would characterize it as more diverse. Game designers love to talk about how they're improving things, but game players keep not buying into it. So this claim is like saying the state of the art in, say, acting is better than it was in the 80s.\n<blockquote><br/>What Malcolm is talking about is absolutely true, by the way. The priorities in developing games that are part of an existing line, intended to compete directly for "traditional gaming" mindshare, a revision of a prior property, or most importantly as<b>work for hire</b>, are driven by some very different concerns than what we tend to focus on as "design." They need to maintain continuity with prior art, be familiar and not TOO innovative to a largely conservative, low-patience-for-reading-the-rules audience that expects NOT to play a game particularly closely to "as written," and present a consistent "house style", among many other considerations that just don't particularly apply to small-press games or games not aimed at the "mainstream gamer."</blockquote>\nThere are a number of implicit assumptions here that aren't really compatible with my own experience, combined with a contemptuous caricature of gamers that kind of sucks. <br/><br/>White Wolf's house style can be summarized as:<br/><br/>1) Use the formatting tags in the style guide.<br/><br/>2) Avoid passive sentence constructions.<br/><br/>3) Format terms and spell words as per the style guide.<br/><br/>I don't know. Maybe at this point they just trust me and they're savagely redlining other guys to make them 6th Grade readable, but I doubt it. Rich Dansky said that his job developing was providing a comfortable place for writers to work, and I don't see current devs being much different. For the most part, feedback concerns making my ideas better, not beating them down. There have been exceptions from time to time, but these usually had to do with supporting some very strong ideas in the line. For instance, when I worked on Manacle and Coin, Geoff Grabowski included some harsh redlines and alterations based on his very strong feelings about the book's theme, and the theme of the entire Exalted line. I didn't agree with them and still don't, actually, but there was no fuckin' way they were done to appeal to gamer conservatism. Hell, if that was true, my Lunars sections would have been *much* different. That book could have easily been written to pander. It wasn't, so now people think I have the same politics as Pol Pot.<br/><br/>Now other companies are more concerned with continuity and working to fan expectations of the world. I did a book for Shadowrun that was way more about that than anything I did for WW.

It's the tendency to know what you like and like what you know. Grognardism is the extreme of it. It's the opposite of the neophilia you tend to tag us Dirty Hippies with.<br/><br/>I would be utterly shocked if there is no direction at the line editor level to maintain a consistent "look and feel" for releases beyond the level of a style guide. It may not tend to get invoked at the redline level - maybe you and everyone you know are so good you never miss - but it's surely there in the prospectus/outline stage. You can't tell me that WW's very strong and distinct brand identity at the line level and above happens just by osmosis. Indeed, pretty much everything you've said about your process speaks to the importance of editorial decisions - whether or not something fits the theme. Or fits it too tightly and needs to be more "multivalent", in your Mage example.<br/><br/>I'm gleaning most of what I can say about the constraints imposed by audience expectations from reading a *whole lot* of game reviews and a fair number of gamer bull sessions. Overwhelmingly, the standards referenced in reviewing have to do with whether the product meets a set of expectations imported from the reviewer's own play history. Games are rarely reviewed on the basis of their own internal design and editorial choices. They are expected to walk a very narrow line between "unoriginal" and "too weird", "mechanically innovative" and "fussy complexity for complexity's sake", "evocative" and "overly restrictive."<br/><br/>Fundamentally, as has been a recurrent theme in these discussions...<br/><br/>The mass market is different from the niche market, and the auteur is different than the contract talent. <br/><br/>To talk about "innovation" on some blanket scale across those gaps invites error.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125803/#Comment_125803" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T11:58:32+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 11:58AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny that you mention the Lunars in Exalted, Malcom.

I was in on the discussion that Buzz was talking about. In addition to extensive playtest experience, the authors cites a number of rather dated games as inspiration, like the old TORG game. (TORG featured a card mechanic that changed the rules during a dramatic scene. Spycraft 2.0 doesn't use cards like this, but makes dramatic scenes more stressful and challenging in a more direct manner.)<br/><br/>One aspect I have seen that is shares with some Indie games is the idea of a GM economy (like Burning Empires has a scene economy).<br/><br/>As I originally mentioned in the thread Buzz was alluding to, I think that many design decisions in Spycraft stem from a conscious decision to make it so the GM does not have to fudge to determine outcomes during play. Some of the results have been around in traditional games for some time (I remember seeing explicit "who rolls" rules back in the 80s), but as a whole, you can see how the desire to create consistency in the living campaign environment affected to rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125820/#Comment_125820" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T13:00:36+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  1:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Honestly, learning a new RPG system, especially if you never<i>really</i>learned your primary one, ain't easy.

Fitting a new RPG in the docket is demanding, trying it with other GMs even more so, something I typically have to save for cons and gamedays.<br/><br/>With this, and considering that there is more just a time investment to read and digest the rulebook, but the tinker with it in play until I get a feel for it, I honestly find Juntin Bow's implication that anyone who is reluctant to switch up games is lazy to be more than a bit insulting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125822/#Comment_125822" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T13:20:41+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  1:20PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must confess that the jargon has shifted such that I'm completely unable to parse "trad" in this context at all.<br/><br/>In distribution?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125829/#Comment_125829" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T13:41:46+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  1:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Not to be contentious, but you're misreading me rather significantly.<br/><br/>Gamer "conservatism" has nothing to do with politics. It's the tendency to know what you like and like what you know. Grognardism is the extreme of it. It's the opposite of the neophilia you tend to tag us Dirty Hippies with.</blockquote>\nIf it was neophilia I'd see fewer rebrandings of old concepts.<br/><br/>If it was all about the grognards, there would have been no reboot. Grognards are generally not worth banking on for filthy commercial reasons: They either don't buy stuff, or they don't buy stuff rationally (they're collectors). Basically, there are a minority of gamers who won't buy or not buy things for reasons nobody can do anything about and they post a lot. Their ability to post a lot is a property of the Internet and not a measure of their importance.<br/><br/>A lot of these guys don't play, either. They buy things and talk about concepts. This, by the way, had a very bad effect on the old Mage. Non-contrived play experiences are a much better guide. When I read, "The orders don't work because [some abstract thing isolated from play]" . . . well, I go and read something else. When I read that "[Merit] has [issues]," that's a bit better. When I read what happens at a table *and* it has the characteristics of real play, then I read Sometimes I'll run the bits myself to see how the bells and whistles work, or research play experiences from venues that are effective labs for the game (like chat groups and LARP; I keep several Cam sites bookmarked to study how written setting implements itself in play).<br/><br/>But lost of players aren't like that -- especially the ones for whom content actually influences the purchasing decision. They're fans, but the fandom is really not the same thing as how they play. For instance, over in Shadownessence there are guys who are really deeply into the WoD, but when I met some of them at a convention they ran a variety of things, experimented with new systems and generally had diverse interests as gamers and people. They're not really "struggling" with games, either. They play just fine.\n<blockquote><br/>I would be utterly shocked if there is no direction at the line editor level to maintain a consistent "look and feel" for releases beyond the level of a style guide. It may not tend to get invoked at the redline level - maybe you and everyone you know are so good you never miss - but it's surely there in the prospectus/outline stage. You can't tell me that WW's very strong and distinct brand identity at the line level and above happens just by osmosis. Indeed, pretty much everything you've said about your process speaks to the importance of editorial decisions - whether or not something fits the theme. Or fits it too tightly and needs to be more "multivalent", in your Mage example.</blockquote>\nActually, by and large we *don't* miss:)  But it's really a back and forth process where everyone contributes. There are exceptions with some developers and some games, but the process I was talking about featured contributions from everyone at the initial stage on up. Yeah, some folks have managerial pull, but the process features more moderation than imposition.\n<blockquote>I'm gleaning most of what I can say about the constraints imposed by audience expectations from reading a *whole lot* of game reviews and a fair number of gamer bull sessions. Overwhelmingly, the standards referenced in reviewing have to do with whether the product meets a set of expectations imported from the reviewer's own play history. Games are rarely reviewed on the basis of their own internal design and editorial choices. They are expected to walk a very narrow line between "unoriginal" and "too weird", "mechanically innovative" and "fussy complexity for complexity's sake", "evocative" and "overly restrictive."<br/></blockquote>\nGame reviews are generally ass, and your statements apply to pretty much anything. There's really no such thing as decent RPG journalism. This does bring home my original point, though. You could ask instead of infer, but you don't. When you're told what the process is, you repeat the inference. Really, if you would rather hold to  your preconceived notions about what people like me do, no amount of dialogue can change that.\n<blockquote>The mass market is different from the niche market, and the auteur is different than the contract talent.<br/><br/>To talk about "innovation" on some blanket scale across those gaps invites error.</blockquote>\nIf that makes you feel better, sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125830/#Comment_125830" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T13:43:48+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  1:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>It's funny that you mention the Lunars in Exalted, Malcom.

I can also start a game of it with zero prep. <br/><br/>Contrast that with just reading through the <i>Eberron</i> CS. Even with big swaths of time set aside on weekends, it's easily taking me over a week. Getting an Eberron game up and running then also requires digestion of the core D&amp;D books, and probably a healthy amount of adventure prep, even if using a published product (such as the <i>Eyes of the Lich Queen</i> module I've been running for the last 20+ weeks).<br/><br/>It's not to say one is inherently better than another (I wouldn't own both if it were), but if a gamer is used to nothing but the Eberron scenario, the prospect of sampling something new is, I would imagine, going to appear daunting. Honestly, I think that's part of the reason groups like the Durham 3 can shift games every couple of sessions; it's just plain easier with the indie stuff.<br/><br/>I think we're drifting. <img

influences, like class levels, experience points, lots of charts, etc. But there are some pretty interesting additions to the game that make it a little different, like using different qualities to score a character's good and evil tendencies. Instead of alignment you pick key words, both good and evil, to describe your character, and the GM tracks the point value of those, which tells how evil/good influenced your character is. If you have a hero that is Selfish who constantly gives his money to the poor and shares with teamates, the GM or player can shift that Selfish trait to something more appropriate, like Selfless or Caring, which shifts the points more toward good. Some traits carry higher values, and depending on the style of game you choose to play, the players may or may not know their point values, but others will react to them accordingly. I think that is pretty cool mechanic, something outside of the traditional alignments.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125845/#Comment_125845" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T14:36:29+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  2:36PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unisystem is an interesting case in point, here.

Overwhelmingly, the standards referenced in reviewing have to do with whether the product meets a set of expectations imported from the reviewer's own play history. Games are rarely reviewed on the basis of their own internal design and editorial choices. They are expected to walk a very narrow line between "unoriginal" and "too weird", "mechanically innovative" and "fussy complexity for complexity's sake", "evocative" and "overly restrictive."<br/></blockquote>\nGame reviews are generally ass, and your statements apply to pretty much anything. There's really no such thing as decent RPG journalism. This does bring home my original point, though. You could ask instead of infer, but you don't. When you're told what the process is, you repeat the inference. Really, if you would rather hold to  your preconceived notions about what people like me do, no amount of dialogue can change that.<br/>Read it carefully, and hold off on the angry-stick for a second.  That was not a statement about the process of publishing a game, it was about what happens afterward.  The chunk you quoted is not talking about the criteria that publishers use, it's talking about the criteria that <i>reviewers</i> use.  You both expressed that game reviews use a baloney set of criteria.

One thing I'd like to see is more focused "how to play this game" sections. Many trad games have a GMs section, but quite often the advice there can be applied to any RPG. I'm not saying general advice is bad, because it is necessary, but often there is an unspoken assumption that such sections are in the books just because they are expected (and thus often get short shrift). I like it when these sections are really on the ball about how to play <i>this</i> game and capture whatever it is about it that makes it special. <i>Feng Shui</i> was a good example (for me anyway) in this regard.<br/><br/>Also, more about how to be a good player in <i>this</i> game. If the game expects the players to go along with what the GM dishing out, then I'd like to see that worked with somehow. "The GM is making this up for you to respond to, here are some ways you can respond to it well and maintain the tone and theme we're going for in this game, as well as helping make things fun for everyone at the table."<br/><br/>Finally, I pick up new trad games looking for just that, something "new" even if it's something as simple as a well executed mechanic that ties the feel of the setting into th system. I mean, when I pick up a story game I know at least that I'll be getting some sort of <i>attempt</i> at something new (which is no guarantee that it will work or be any good).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125900/#Comment_125900" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T20:49:03+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  8:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>You know what I really appreciate, when I look back on games from the nineties that don't seem to know they were made in the nineties, instead designing for the naughties.<br/><br/>1993 -<b>Underground</b>. Containing specific rules to empower the players to come up with their own goals (the example they give is "eliminate the AIDS problem in Los Angeles county"), and to figure out how to tackle the issue by altering the current state of society. The players suggest storylines that will allow them to change the social landscape (examples given: break into the Super Bowl transmission in order to raise education levels, or help an honest investor take over a crooked corporation in order to raise wealth levels). It has stats for where society is now along seven parameters, and where they have to end up for the desired change to happen.<br/><br/>1994 Mind's Eye Theatre<b>The Masquerade</b>(2nd Edition). Conflict resolution. Right there on page 83, player A wants to hit player B, player B wants to escape. If player A wins during the resolution mechanics, their goal happens, if player B wins, their goal happens (and the loser loses whatever resource they bid). I know I know it's a LARP, but the rules in this game work just as well for TT. I'd also point at the Influence rules, that give players a mechanical way to be all intrigue-y (something that for me was really lacking in the actual VtM rules).<br/><br/>1996<b>Dragonlance Fifth Age</b>. The players are the only ones who engage the resolution mechanics. You want to hit someone? Roll to hit. You want to not be hit? Roll to avoid being hit. The GM never engages the resolution mechanics. Also, no real advancement (your attributes and skills (such as they are) do not improve over time, although you do get more competent). Finally, during random character creation (that I swear is totally fun, seriously, I could sit around making Fifth Age characters all day), you are mechanically encouraged to be a good guy.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout. Underground blew my socks off with the way you could change society (or not).

No, see, I have a problem, and it doesn't happen in any other hobby that I'm involved in, just with RPGs:<br/><br/><i><b>I'm addicted to The <span style="color: #FF3300;">New</span>.</b></i><br/><br/>There's nothing else about it. This is why I like hearing about all sorts of new RPGs, or trolling RPGnet, or whatever: I love to hear about the Latest Game, and how it's got these really cool 1-2 <b><span style="color: #FF3300;">New</span></b> things that it does. Forge-style games tend to be <span style="color: #FF3300;"><b>New</b></span> ideas without much anything else getting in the way, which can be refreshing, but sometimes also hard to relate to at first.  While I love my tight little focused games here and there, what I've come to realize in the past few years is that I love taking these <span style="color: #FF3300;"><b>New</b></span> ideas that spring up in mainstream and focused games, and apply them to other mainstream games, to enhance the fun. Little hacks.<br/><br/>To that end, I love to see when there's a few cool ideas that come out in a game: The stuff quoted above (Underground, Feng Shui, Over the Edge, Mind's Eye, etc) is a great example of that. I guess what doesn't appeal to me personally, as much, is to see a game which looks like it has a really clear division between Setting (written by these folk over here), System (written by those folk over there), without anything new to bridge the two together in a new way. Like, the game is being pushed on how hot the setting is, but the system is just like anything you've ever seen before, just using dice in a new way (for me, Tribe 8 was kinda like this).<br/><br/>And yet, having said that, if the setting is all that badass, we have the backs of hundreds of innovative ideas to stand on to push/implement in those lackluster games.<br/><br/>EDIT: Actually, I have an example that happened recently. We're setting up to play L5R (next game is tomorrow). The game doesn't help set up any real decent scenario for getting the disparate clans talking/working together, but I came up with a situation using rules applied from other games, like Burning Empires/Blossoms and the like. Finally, we got in a combat with what I thought to be "average" mooks, and the PCs got creamed. We're using L5R 1st edition rules, where every wound track you sink you lose another die to roll. It's a doomsayer's death spiral: One hit and it's hard to recover. Everything else about the game I found to be ripe clay to mold and twist using lessons from other games (conflict resolution, situation set-up, character drama, etc), but the combat system, which I actually am going to work a lot (Shadowlands zombies), just Did Not Work in the way I wanted it to for this game. <br/><br/>After thinking about it for a few minutes, I pretty much lifted an idea from another semi-trad game that I've played (and am working on releasing in the US), that Tenra Bansho game I keep rambling about. It has a real unique wound track, where initially you take damage and it's slightly harder to do stuff. Then, right before you die, you actually get bonus dice. Simulates all those console games, anime, manga you read where the boss bounces back screaming "This is my FINAL FORM!" and like starts glowing and shit.  So having that on the brain, I took the wound track from L5R: "0,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,Down,Out/Dead", and replaced it with something that looks like "0,0,-1,-1,-2,<b>+2,+5,Down (+5)</b>,Out/Dead". We'll experiment with it tomorrow, but I smell "rocking out". This is the kind of thing I love.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125949/#Comment_125949" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T08:54:55+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  8:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Like, the game is being pushed on how hot the setting is, but the system is just like anything you've ever seen before, just using dice in a new way (for me, Tribe 8 was kinda like this).</blockquote>\nYes.  I completely agree, and I resonate with Andy's comment about liking the little ideas as hacks for other games.<br/><br/>Mainstream can be a tricky term to nail down, as it holds meaning in both the design and marketing contexts, and these two areas become somewhat recursive and interdependent.  DnD, for example, has a lot of stock built up in its audience being familiar with its mechanics.  So too does White Wolf, since the parameters of the Storytelling System remain essentially the same across umpteen game lines.  Over time, games that succeed in establishing a line gain mechanical inertia.  It would be difficult to change them without alienating a portion of your market that has invested itself in the existing rules and the look and feel of [Brand X].  Remember White Wolf's project Exile?  The original vision (as I read it) proposed a totally different mechanic than Storyteller and offered some very cool faction mechanics in the form of Character Memes.<br/><br/>The difference between a mainstream game designed and produced by a team and an "auteur" game designed and produced by a single individual seems obvious on its face.  The team may have a designer to articulate and steer the core design vision, but you're taking a lot of systemic input on a collaborative basis, and some of what results will be geared at making a product that will sell to the target market.  The indie designer (based on invidious stereotyping I'm doing from reading y'all's posts here) seems far more motivated by realization of a private vision, much like small press everywhere.  Having participated in the videogame industry for over a decade and participating in a team-executed game design process, I can say the final design always embodies a nontrivial amount of compromise.  Obviously my experience doesn't necessarily map to White Wolf's process (I hope it doesn't, since it was making me crazy), but what Malcolm shared about Mage: the Awakening being three different games at one point seems to drive the point home.<br/><br/>On the mainstream game question from the OP, I haven't seen any mechanice that has struck me as particularly innovative in the games I consider mainstream--but I have seen concepts refined from other games.

DnD, for example, has a lot of stock built up in its audience being familiar with its mechanics.  So too does White Wolf, since the parameters of the Storytelling System remain essentially the same across umpteen game lines.  Over time, games that succeed in establishing a line gain mechanical inertia.  It would be difficult to change them without alienating a portion of your market that has invested itself in the existing rules and the look and feel of [Brand X].  Remember White Wolf's project Exile?  The original vision (as I read it) proposed a totally different mechanic than Storyteller and offered some very cool faction mechanics in the form of Character Memes.</blockquote>\nUh, no. In D&amp;D's case there have been at least four different game systems with that name. White Wolf has had three different systems with "Story" in the name. The differences between these systems are not trivial from either a design or play standpoint -- and by design, I mean the objective movements of actual numbers and how they relate to outcomes, not how we choose to shoot the shit about capitalized terms. <br/><br/>And from what I've been able to glean, Exile's fate was determined more by its logistical failures than anything else.\n<blockquote>The difference between a mainstream game designed and produced by a team and an "auteur" game designed and produced by a single individual seems obvious on its face.  The team may have a designer to articulate and steer the core design vision, but you're taking a lot of systemic input on a collaborative basis, and some of what results will be geared at making a product that will sell to the target market.  The indie designer (based on invidious stereotyping I'm doing from reading y'all's posts here) seems far more motivated by realization of a private vision, much like small press everywhere.</blockquote>\nIndie-branded designers do no such thing. In fact, there's significant skepticism when people design things *without* going through what essentially amounts to a community approval process. I've read everything from jaded curiosity to contemptuous dismissal when it comes to actual, auteur-driven games, because those games come from outside normal community channels. I've experienced this many times myself.<br/><br/>In fact, the auteur-driven games tend to be pretty "mainstream," because they *are* actually the result of an individual vision, as opposed to the desire to make a mark in a community. Some of these games are quite shitty -- they're the nth D&amp;D hack. On a more positive note, a game like James Maliszewki's Thousand Suns is auteur-ish, because he was interested in a particular aesthetic instead of how a design would be perceived by a community. Reign? Another one. Because auteurs <i>do not ask for anyone's approval</i>. And by that standard, the number of genuine auteurs in the indie or commercial categories is not only vanishingly small, but utterly unrelated to game systems or theoretical stances. And quality or creative integrity, for that matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126092/#Comment_126092" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T18:42:15+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  6:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2008 10:08PM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/><br/>I hear ya.

This is borne out by how the systems play and player experience. The procedures are different, and you really can't generate parallel results across versions any more than you can across two unrelated games. And the math works differently, to boot. <br/><br/>There are real differences; you've merely chosen to devalue them. If you'd like to generalize to enough of an extent to do that, doing it evenly leaves little innovation on either end. Sorcerer becomes a snarky derivative of Vampire, Stormbringer and OtE (and in fact becomes a game I can run *with* OtE, easily). Many narrative games become fairly dull variants of a basic model, where we add some traits and a transparent GM substitute to provide enough railroading to make a coherent game session. These are of course unfair things to say -- but they're consistent with your position.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126215/#Comment_126215" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T10:50:55+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 10:50AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>Uh, no.

I'm most interested in seeing if it attempts to do something differently, something that hasn't been done before, or something that has been done before and does it better (like, really much better). Several new (released within the last 6 months) products I have bought recently are indeed "new" but as far as the mechanics go, don't really do anything different than similar games produced five or even ten years ago. Some seemed to attempt an advance, but failed. These products I have not been overly impressed with, even though I may still try running the games because the setting is intriguing enough to me to try and make them work.<br/><br/>Tristan (above) asks what's stopping anyone from using a different system, and the answer is nothing at all. However, I like to see mechanics that are connected, somehow, to whatever it is the setting is trying to evoke; mechanics which also evoke the setting, theme, genre, what have you; or mechanics which advance play at the table toward achieving the experience the game wants to provide. So sometimes, when a game's setting is cool but the system is pants (especially if it lacks that system/setting meld-mechanic that I'm looking for) I wonder why they bothered with a system at all. Pure setting books don't sound like such a bad idea to me really, in this case (for example, I really grooved on the Iron Kingdoms GM's Guide, I think it was, as it had mostly setting info and few rules)<br/><br/>That means that I often try to run games with cool settings, but lousy systems, as written, because I'm hoping that whatever the designer felt the system was doing for the setting may still come through. My friends ask me why I don't change the system if I don't like it, and my answer is that I don't want to (I feel it should be working right from the git-go). I'm often disappointed that I need to hack, patch, or otherwise modify some game systems to get them to do this. As a counter-example, a game I didn't feel a need to do this with at all was Feng Shui. It promised a Hong Kong action movie feeling, and the system delivered.<br/><br/>So while the mechanics may be secondary for some, for me at any rate, I want to see them supporting and encouraging the type of experience the game's setting, themes, and tropes propose to provide. I strongly feel that any new game that isn't a "universal" system (GURPS, Savage Worlds, etc) needs to have a good system/setting meld if it wants to capture my interest. If that meld isn't there, and the system is flat, uninspired, broken, or otherwise not at the same level as the setting, I wonder if the game wouldn't have been better off without it.<br/><br/>That's how I feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126278/#Comment_126278" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T14:16:47+00:00" title="February 13, 2008  2:16PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>Also, sometimes the NEW is really the OLD with a new coat of paint and some glitter.</blockquote>\nAh, for me I was specifically talking of "idea gems" that are in games.

It's a little uneven, but there are parts where it finds new mountains, climbs, them, and plants a little flag of pure awesome at the peak. I'll probably comment more on it when I get done, but I want to flag a few things.<br/><br/>1. Aggressive use of charts and diagrams to illustrate not just information about a city, but different ways of looking at that information.  I've seen good diagrams and charts before, but this is a whole other category of approach, and it's fantastic.<br/><br/>2. Ok, so duplicating charts may be tough to do, but they do another dirty trick that is totally worth stealing.  In describing the various roles of importance in the city (Prince, Sheriff etc.) they provide a decent description, then a very long list of things that the person in that role might do on a given night, each briefly detailed.  I found this absolutely brilliant because these examples are incredibly useful in helping you get a picture of the role, but they're _also_ a giant list of plot seeds.  Making the explanation/example into something which is usable in a different way after you understand the idea is incredibly potent.<br/><br/>3. Graffiti. So there's a chapter on graffiti and secret messages, and it's ok, but it's noteworthy for one element - it is explicitly a way to allow characters who are usually outside the WW cluster of "political" skills (Politics, socialize, subterfuge etc.) to bring their skills (art, academics, streetwise etc. ) into a political game.  Some folks might view that as a patch, but it seems to me like a nice way to introduce a setting element that lets you focus on one style within a broader game without disenfranchising anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126605/#Comment_126605" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T12:49:34+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought Damnation City could have been a bit more systemic, but it does have some neat stuff.

When it included an inspirational music section and it _didn't_ make me want to kill someone, it earned innumerable points right then and there because, well, it could have been much worse.* <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  So far most of what's impressed me has been about presentation or clever tricks.  I still haven't gotten to the "high level game" chapters, and those are where I'm most curious to see the system (well, that and rules for using cards from the boardgame, which i don't own, but the very idea of it tickles my fancy). <br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>* In contrast, the fact that they did the early R-Maps is exactly why I considered the bar to fairly high in that regard.  Other game lines have done more interesting things with them in the interim (7th Sea's Montaigne book being an example I'm fond of) so on one level this was just retaking an old title. Still, they exceeded my expectations soundly, to the point where I would use the charts to illustrate points relating to other games.**<br/><br/>** - However, I'm also a giant chart nerd, so my excitement is best taken with a grain of salt. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126689/#Comment_126689" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T16:50:43+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  4:50PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite><br/>PS - Though in the interests of the actually good, I'm part of the way through White Wolf's<i>Damnation City</i>, the big book of running an urban campaign for vampire, and sweet holy crap.

Not from a theological point of view, with gods or karma or whatnot, but because <i>Dragons</i> dream the worlds PCs explore. And dragons dream of the same characters again and again. The game implies that dragons are a metaphor of the players, GM included. Though to the denizens of the dreams they are more like the mythical creatures one would expect. So in a way they are like gods, except they don't have much control over their dreams, and when nightmares happens out of this lack of control, it may cause a mass wake up of the dragons. This is only a background story, the game itself doesn't deal with those cataclysms, instead they provide cultural specificity of the setting like : "why do most NPCs hate magic users ? " "because they're considered to be the reason why dragons woke up in previous eras"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo PCs are reincarnations. As a result, one part of the character sheets is devoted to what the game calls "archetype" which is a record of the highest level of competence the character reached in previous incarnations for each skills. (I know I'm getting tedious there but wait it all gets clear at some point)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game has two types of scenarii (= mini campaigns). Typical ones which could be compared to D&amp;D; (looking for a treasure, save an area of nasty nightmare creatures etc...), and archetype dreams which my group really was delighted with. An archetype dream is a premise sequence where every PCs would have the same, or almost the same dream. Say we dream of a sumptuous palace and are present for a crowning. Usually the dream had sth a little weird about it, for instance instead of a court crowning a prince, they would crown a stray cat. Then the GM would explain that this dream the PCs had is very obsessive, is actually a memory from a previous incarnation and if they manage to re-enact the scene they dreamed in all its tiny details they would earn experience points = they may improve skills and get closer to their archetypes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the rest of the scenario would be spent exploring how to make a cat crowned in the very palace the PCs dream of. On one hand it's the horror of "my god, we have to try and guess what the GM has planned for us to do ?" On the other hand many comic and heroic situations can be forced this way, like say the players exhuming an old law book of the kingdom where it is stipulated that a cat may become king if a grotesque set of conditions were completed...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this mechanism was very nice in framing the final scene. Plus the rule system is rewarding players for achieving these crazy quests and bringing the story to an end. The game is in many ways completely traditional : narrative control by the GM, focus on simulation, a lot of crunch. But the presentation of a world-dream, whose source are the players, has this nice poetic self-awareness to it that has seduced my group for many years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152151/#Comment_152151" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T18:54:41+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  6:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a really cool description, thanks for posting it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>The "reincarnation via different character sheets" was also done in Fireborn (with dragons too, ironically enough, though it sounds quite different), along with some other tentative stabs at weird things.

I mean I write a fair bit of Ars Magica, and one of the previous posters was suggesting it was getting more trad in the new edition.  Wht does that mean?  I mean -really- assume I'm a guy who writes a bit of Ars and I'd like to understand other ways to approach my writing to make it better and I am really and truly asking you: what do you -mean-?<br><br>Does mathematics make it trad?  Serious crunchiness is trad?  If so, yes, that's true, although I kind of feel the tide will go back out on number crunchiness after the next booik, which is kind of the Ultimate Stat Mod Pack for Ars, in which the Numbers for Everything are released and after a final and victorious statement of the high crunch style of writing, I think things will go in a less crunchy way, because once you have the toolkit numbers, we don't need to address them again directly.<br><br>If its that it had shared authority, then that's something that kind of went out a bit in the core rulebook and comes back in during the supplements.  Covenant design is explicitly a process in which you make selections not based on simulating a real world, but based on designing a co-operative storytelling space, for example. Is that what you mean?<br/><br/>If its based on character goals, again the stories supported in the core book are more traditional than in the supplement books.  Mystery Cults, particularly, has some odd ideas in it, and Societates has an idea which when I wrote it I thought was pretty revolultionary for Ars, which is that at some point your character will wake up to himself and stop looking for experience points, and seek goals based on changing the world, rather than the points on his sheet, and that the characters in the game notice that this shift between learning (gaining XP) and acting (choosing to not gain XP - note that in Ars, you are penalised for adventuring by slower XP gain) takes place.<br/><br/>Is it that confliuct resolution methods involving combat make stuff trad?  The Criamon magi are pacifists, so is that new?  Is the fact that I stole it from "Journey to the West" and the Monkey King being forbidden to kill, which makes it thousands of years old, relevent to if this is traditional?  Is "traditional"anything 1990s in style, so philosophies of combat resolution which are older than that are non-trad, despite not being new?<br/><br/>I see this matters to a lot of you, and I can see that you have a coherent discussion ,which means you are using the terms in waysthat all of you accept as meaningful, but I'm just not getting you, and I'd like to.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_152187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152187/#Comment_152187" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T01:11:20+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  1:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>I once asked the Spycraft 2.0 designers if they'd ever heard of the Forge or played any small press stuff, and they had no idea what I was talking about. 2.0 was apparently born out of *tons* of observation of actual play, via Living Spycraft.

Their designers do not derive social rewards from talking about game design on the Internet. These games the result of complex design choices that not only consider an overall artistic direction, but how it will change in the face of various player approaches. Some mainstream games use literary techniques that aren't a part of the corpus of theory here; most are designed to support multiple play modes simultaneously.</blockquote>I read the last part of this as a respectful attitude towards designers of classical roleplaying games. That is really nice to see.<br/><br/>The first part though, is a bit too cheap in its description of designers within the modern paradigm. To be driven by "an abstract desire for novelty" implies that content, coherence and player-satisfaction is of lesser interest to such designers. That is absolutely not true, in my view.<br/><br/>Even though Malcolm seems to be <i>insulted </i>on behalf of classical designers, and drive himself into an indefensible corner with his ramblings on the indie-scene, he seems to have alternative points of view that are well worth going into. So I hope his "red card" will be rescinded.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Bullshit.  You don't tell people about it.  You hammer them with it, insult them, and then paint anyone who disagrees as an immoral asswipe.</blockquote>I am very sorry to quote this! I would rather not do it, but Ryan is really <i>hammering </i> at Malcolm here, and I do not like it one bit. Although Malcolm has presented his views in a way that may insult some thinkers here, he has not used words like this. So Ryans harsh answer is way beyond the mark, in my view.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>designer intent is a giant waste of time for consumers and nobody should ever care about it, ever.  The designer is dead.</blockquote>I suppose you mean that most players will care less for the intent of the designer, and focus their care on how the game plays. Actual play is king, for the players.<br/><br/>Still; as a designer of games I must, with a smile, protest. To me it seems like I am alive. My colleagues seems to be breathing too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_152190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152190/#Comment_152190" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T01:48:48+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  1:48AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2008 1:56AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Interestingly, most "trad" games I've found have very clear instructions on how to play them, but very few people actually read them, and many assume they're not there.

Your claim goes a long way in supporting the way Malcolm Sheppard writes about this thing. And it makes me think: it may be that the standard rant on classical RPGs on sites like this has more to do with people building fellowship by being different/special, than actual game design.<br/><br/>It also makes me think about the mechanical focus of RPG-discussions. It has always confounded me. It may be that most people tend to skip the broader writings on <i>method <b></b></i> (being something more than mechanical conflict resolution) that has actually been done in classical RPGs. It may be most readers of classical RPGs believe those parts of the game to be "only player style" (as in: for newbies), and not actually an important part of how the game plays ...<br/><br/>Mind you: I do like to take the odd stab at these old games myself. Mostly I feel justified in doing so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_152193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152193/#Comment_152193" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T02:30:10+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  2:30AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I commend the tread-starter.
