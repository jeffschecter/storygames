A non-complete list is:<br/><br/>* Money. Someone has to buy the game. A more pronoucned difficulty for games with lots of supplements and high individual prices.<br/>* Rules knowledge. Some games require participants to learn a lot of rules befgore they can effectively participate.<br/>* Play culture knowledge. Outside of the textual rules, there's often murky stuff about how the game is approached that is part of the culture for any given roleplayer, and that simply has to be learned or adjusted to through experience.<br/>* Time per session. Most roleplaying games require more than an hour, and often several hours, to have even just a session of play.<br/>* Time management, longer term - many roleplaying games work best or actively require several sessions of play, which need scheduling/organising.<br/>* Continuity of group - a roleplaying game is often difficult to adjust to the people present: more players, fewer players and different players all present challenges to an ongoing game.<br/>* Set-up time - whether it's character generation, scenario generation, GM prep...<br/>* Requirements of the space - nearly always, you need a table and chairs. Why not a roleplaying game you can play without a table (I once heard a report of Nicotine Girls played like this) or while walking to the cinema (Vincent had a game like this once).<br/>* Equipment requirements - dice etcetera.<br/><br/>What I'd love to see is more games that explicitly went out to attack all of this stuff - to make an RPG with the smallest social footprint possible.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171857/#Comment_171857" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T06:34:05+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  6:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>What I'd love to see is more games that explicitly went out to attack all of this stuff - to make an RPG with the smallest social footprint possible.</blockquote>\nRoleplaying poems like <i>The Believers</i> generally take a flaming sword to this stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171866/#Comment_171866" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T07:38:43+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  7:38AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2008 7:38AM by eruditus.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often bemoan the fact that when a game isn't quite sparking right away some of my friends bail.  I contend that our hobby is not only in the gaming itself but part of a social contract among friends to spend time in this activity.  It's friends getting together, breaking bread, debating and telling a story together - it's the process.  Not that a thousand games don't support this process but I worry when we can get games that require less and less discipline, less and less commitment.  Not to say games like BE are for everyone but how can you compete when you're like "oh, we can just game while walking to WaWa between WoW raids."   Grrrrr.<br/><br/>Okay, now that I vented...<br/><br/>yeah, this weekend I was in a position where a RPG on a long car ride would have rocked.

I can't blame anyone for lacking discipline or commitment when they bail on something that's not working for them. The whole "fifteen minutes of fun packed into four hours" thing means that role-playing often demands a LOT of commitment.<br/><br/>The other thing is that there probably are some aspects of roleplaying that can only be fully enjoyed by making some kinds of commitments, in the same way that one can only achieve a full enjoyment of say, salsa dancing, by putting in a fair amount of effort to learn steps and get in shape. But you also need that accessible entry point - beginner's classes that are fun right away in half an hour for the salsa, and games that are fun right away in half an hour for roleplaying. Otherwise, many people who could have been convinced to make the commitment will never get any inkling of why it could be good to make it.<br/><br/>I'm also convinced that a lot of the commitment involved in roleplaying is actually unnecessary, and one can achieve experiences that are just as good while stripping out large chunks of the footprint. Some of it simply comes down to game design and social mechanics that are inefficient.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171871/#Comment_171871" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T08:25:02+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  8:25AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a rise in games that play in one session (<b>the Shab Al-Hiri Roach</b>, for example, and I've seen others I can't recall at the moment).<br/><br/><b>3:16</b> is designed so you can pick up the book and play.

In the broader sense that all possible activities exist in competition for one's leisure time, leisure effort and leisure money, then small footprint RPGs and large footprint RPGs are in competition, just as they are also in competition with fishing, ten-pin bowling, watching TV, reading a book, going to bars etcetera.<br/><br/>However in the narrower sense that some people are already willing and wanting to spend the investment required for a large footprint game and indeed prefer their games that way, and other people would much rather play games with smaller footprints and are unwilling or only grudgingly invest in large footprint ones, they are separate markets.<br/><br/>At the margin, there's also a sense in which there would be competition for people who's play preferences were not so polarised, who would happily play a quick no-set up RPG on the train in half an hour but also love their eighty-week D&amp;D campaigns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171877/#Comment_171877" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T09:16:54+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  9:16AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest that the answer to your opening question is there, in the words.

That doesn't make them bad, it just makes them lacking in well, activity!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt strikes me that all of the things that you mention in your original post can be applied to an awful lot of other hobbies and activities - I ran through them and they were all applicable for playing in a 5-a-side Soccer League, being part of a WoW raiding guild and showing pedigree dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that if you say, took the need to have a dog, know how to show them, know what the judges were looking for, be able to show them in under 10 minutes, once, instantly, from your own front room with only one brush to use ... well, you probably wouldn't be showing dogs.

Your dog might not be as well trained and groomed and won't win prizes, your WoW character might not have the best gear or be able to beat the hardest raids, and your football will lack flair and will never be competitive, but... you can have fun.<br/><br/>In short, I'm interested in the non-hobbyist version of RPGs. And I want to know - what has to be sacrificed to make that possible? It may turn out to be true that I just can't enjoy RPGs without large social footprints, but somehow I doubt it.

You can remove them all you up to barest minimum to publish games about freeform making up bullshit with contest/resolution(see, no barriers!)  based on a toss of a coin but what does it would give them in the experience and process of bullshitting that they don't have in their normal life?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople make up stories all the time. They watch and listen to them all the time. Is there anything special in making up some stories in very specific context (i.e. specific fiction type and what can one get from the story) and very specific restriction (i.e. the very simplest session assumption)? None. This is the basic deal breaker. It's just your or mine way to enjoy making up some narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Just look at the rpg poems and jeepforms. People are doing them all the time only in rpg poems it's codified in some way and given specific goal.

With any rpg, the magic is in successfully structuring the social context to make collaborative story-telling and character acting enjoyable and functional simultaneously.  For this particular goal, the question is: how can you balance that tension with the least possible footprint?

Most of the time it ends up being a rules intense game, but one that can have minimalish prep time.  The GM plans out large story arcs when they have time, and when the four of us are together, we just play.  We figure it's as close to the sort of pickup games one sees developing at gyms and parks as we're liable to get. This lowers the social footprint in a number of ways. First, it reduces the time management/commitment aspect to almost nothing. Games happen when the four of us are looking for something to do.   Second, we've already spent the money and time necessary to acquire all the gear to play, and the culture in which to play.  In terms of the hobby/activity question, I think that the pickup game actually falls under activity.  We could play WoW, play video games, etc, but sometimes we choose to have a pickup game.<br>\n<br>\nWith the large group we'll be experimenting with the continuity of the group footprint.  By having such a large group, gaming becomes feasible even if as many as 5 of us are missing.  This should make it more of a designated, every two week evening activity, less of a mandatory hobby type event.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of money, most of the time we buy games that we can play over and over and have different experiences with.  I know it's a long-run view, but I think that the money element of going and seeing a movie (around $20, depending on time of day and if you have a date), is a more limiting social footprint than buying a $20 book that I know can give me hours of entertainment.  Not saying it's not a valid point, more for me it's a question of $/hours of entertainment, not just $$$.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the space requirement element.  The majority of the games I play in don't even have a table anymore.  Players grab books and dice and sit wherever.  True, we still need chairs, but that's at the same level as video gaming, watching TV, or just sitting around and chatting.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171894/#Comment_171894" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T10:36:38+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 10:36AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: drunkencatgirl</cite>Then what's this all fuzz about?

RPGs, even story games, don't quite work like "telling someone a story".

Adults don't do things "just because it's fun". Ther's always a reason behind the activity, generally somehow getting status of some flavor.

Why? Because it's not a destination activity. Sure, if I've already got a large group of people together for no particular purpose, I can bring out a micro-game and get some buy-in. But... in point of fact, it's very difficult to put together a gathering of people for anything other than a <b>purpose</b>. We're all very busy. We have families. When I see my friends, it's usually because of some purpose - to paint the deck, move, go to a movie, have a barbeque, watch the hockey game. Playing games doesn't have the same force of gravity.<br><br>What <b>does</b> is something that feels like more of a commitment, paradoxically. Sure, you never get the mildly curious casual person - but in practice, I've not found them all that engaged anyhow. But "give me your odd-numbered Tuesday evenings for the next couple months, and we'll do X" will get people to show up and engage.<br><br>Best I can explain it is that casual games just get lost in the shuffle. They're never actually important enough to happen. When we have one of those rare times that 4 or 5 friends are visiting, we spend it shooting the breeze, talking about the kids/job/house/whatever, drinking wine and perpetually talking about breaking out a board game but rarely actually getting around to it.<br><br>I think that generally speaking, <b>at least in the social milieux I am usually in</b>, telling stories is too structured to be casual. When we do engage in structured games, they're the sort that require minimal actual engagement and are mostly there to lubricate socialization and banter. I don't discount the idea that there are social contexts in which this isn't the case - I've known people who break out hardcore German boardgames at social parties - but (perhaps crucially) they tend to be younger, singler, and geekier than my circles do.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171946/#Comment_171946" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T13:17:56+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  1:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark:  Strangely enough, I've found the opposite to be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe've got a group of friends who <i>try</i> to get together every wednesday in order to play D&amp;D; 4e.

If we <i>only</i> got together for our D&amp;D; nights, that would be less frequent, and that (in turn) would make it hard for me to stay committed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171954/#Comment_171954" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T13:43:49+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  1:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, sounds to me like you have a destination event.

But then again, even something like DitV takes some set-up time, for player chargen and GM prep. sure it's streamlined - you can get it done in a half-hour, although if (as I typically am) I'm having to explain the rules and the setting as well as trying to roll up a town and help people generate characters...\n<blockquote><br/>As for only going a session or two...

I have frequently and successfully run it in two hours or even less, with complete novice players, chargen and scenario played to satisfying completion. No Gm prep, lightining quick chargen, a concept (ghostbusters) that's easy to get buy in for, really simple rules, defined end point for a given mission.

Contents may have settled in shipping, etc etc.<br/><br/>I think that a lot of games intended for easy, quick setup and play end up undermining their potential with exotic settings and focus for play. I've gotten best results of this sort from games set in familiar environments, with well-worn, even flat-out cliched, centers of attention. The quick start and easy play come when I can offload key parts of the explanation onto the surrounding world: "vampires, individually Rice-style fops, collectively, Ultraviolet-style schemers", for instance, given friends of mine who dig vampires, or "post-World War II espionage, with the warm cuddliness of vintage Le Carre and the secret history of weird science in a Tim Powers-esque emotional vein". (I've got a group of friends waiting for us all to be in the same state again after business trips and such for a Cold War game on the basis of that description.)<br/><br/>Now I recognize that not everyone has the same mix of stimuli, and I'm not trying to claim anything like that. But I get most reliable good results when I can start off with "it's this thing you like" and best results when it's "it's these two things you like mashed together". If the stuff that's going to happen in play is itself unfamiliar, then I do at least as well to use a larger game and more elaborate setup and play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172073/#Comment_172073" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T08:01:44+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  8:01AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2008 8:03AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Solo gamebooks have very little social footprint.

Our social time is too much at a premium to use it focusing on imaginary stuff. I suspect any game small-footprint enough to get around that constraint would be a casual card game or something.

These conceptions can be pretty deep and painful, and it isn't always obvious when story games don't fit them. A story game that makes it as clear as possible, as early as possible, that the "game" stuff is less psychologically operative than the "story" stuff will do well at overcoming this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172213/#Comment_172213" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T18:11:16+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  6:11PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Misuba, you're totally right about focus, and that's a really important axis of the footprint. The fact that one can say, play poker and engage in conversation not about the poker at the same time is a major plus point for poker as a social activity.<br/><br/>I think people angst too much about levels of engagement at the table. When did you last give your 100% attention to something? The closest activities I know to consuming all of my attention at once is watching movies or film alone, and even then I typically feel the urge to pause it every so often to do something else. So why should roleplaying demand absolute focus? Perhaps it's through a strained analogy with acting, coupled with concerns that players should speak "in character" as much as possible, that this impression emerges.<br/><br/>The psychologically operative angle is interesting but I suspect less successful for the analysis of any one game text as each person's psychological response (and each group's psychosocial response) to a given activity is likely to be too idiosyncratic to be easily generalisable.<br/><br/>Ryan, I like your little list of D&amp;D 4e questions, but am uncertain of precisely the point you were trying to make. Is the idea nearly all social groupings would be unable to answer all of these questions in the affirmative?<br/><br/>As for solo gaming: indeed, a very small social footprint, with many of the axes being effectively set to zero. And Choose Your Own Adventures were huge in their day, before videogames completely swallowed the solo gaming mindshare. Could they be revived? Worth a shot, surely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172215/#Comment_172215" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T18:23:59+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  6:23PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2008 6:24PM by Ry.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>Is the idea nearly all social groupings would be unable to answer all of these questions in the affirmative?</blockquote>Not at all - just that MANY groups can't answer all those in the affirmative, and MANY games assume you'll answer along those lines.  Burning Wheel wants you to answer that way for the first six, Sorcerer the first four, Polaris the first three, and In A Wicked Age the first two.  Of course, all of those games have other questions they ask as well.  <br/><br/>I posted it because I'm working on one of my ridiculously long flowcharts titled "Choose Your Game Wisely" and this thread had me pull out a few elements from that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172235/#Comment_172235" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T01:29:46+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  1:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Misuba, focus, yes.

Silence makes sense there because there's no easy way to confine the effects of your socialisation to the group without also interacting with the strangers, and since they are strangers to you, socialising with them is probably not your goal going in (cinema being a terrible way to meet people).<br/><br/>On the other hand, watching a movie at home with your friends, people often do talk, comment, throw popcorn and suchlike, and this enhances rather than detracts from the overall experience.<br/><br/>I also think that compared to watching a movie, roleplaying is a more directly social experience (you're usually facing each other, usually speaking words to one another as the main source of entertainment, communication as a group is critical to the success of the activity) and so therefore the need exists to allow people to actually socialise. Expecting people to not socialise in such a situation is like dropping a lump of potassium into some hydrochloric acid and expecting it not to react - in such an obviously social situation, socialisation wants to happen.<br/><br/>The Big Model's most critical insight, in my opinion, is that roleplaying is inherently a social activity. I think design decisions about the amount of focus required should bear that in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
