I went back last year and updated and revised my list. Here's what changed. How about you? If you're new to SG and didn't post in that previous thread, tell us what you were interested in playing a year ago (if you remember that far), and out of that list what you got to play.<br/><br/>My list a year ago was:<br/><br/>-----<br/>1 - Conspiracy of Shadows<br/>2 - Dirty Secrets<br/>3 - Shinobigami (and will throw in DoubleCross here too)<br/>4 - Freemarket<br/>5 - Remember Tomorrow<br/>-----<br/><br/><b>Out of those, I played:</b><br/>Shinobigami (not yet, but in a few days)<br/>Freemarket (Camp Nerdly)<br/>Remember Tomorrow<br/><br/><b>Of those, I did not play:</b><br/>Conspiracy of Shadows<br/>Dirty Secrets<br/><br/>Plus I played a ton of new games and stuff, but that's neither here nor there.<br/><br/>Conclusions: <br/>* Got over half my list filled, so that's good!<br/>* Did not get around to Dirty Secrets yet. Not avoiding it, just stuff that interested me more popped into view and got all up in my grill that much faster.<br/>* Did not get around to Conspiracy of Shadows. Was kinda waiting for the rules to settle down before digging in (Revised happened after Keith played and loved the Shadow of Yesterday, so CoS became heavily influenced by SoY; Third edition was coming soon, but it shifted from Burning Wheel to Mouseguard rules before stopping). Since Keith keeps the older versions of the game available online so my friends can buy it, I am thinking of playing the CoS first edition again, because I think that game has the strongest vision of the rules tied to the setting (some of the hacks in revised are cool, might find a way to incorporate those into 1st edition).<br/><br/>Anyway, now I need to make a new list for 2011. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14748" rel="nofollow">So I just started a thread for that, too</a>!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335361/#Comment_335361" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T10:46:20+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 10:46AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2011 10:57AM by Joe_Beason.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My list was:<br/><br/>1 - PtA<br/>2 - Roach<br/>3 - InSpectres<br/>4 - Dresden<br/>5 - Freemarket <br/><br/>I've played Roach and InSpectres.

Half the games might have been different a month later.  I've since played the first two.  I would still really like to play 1001 Nights and think my odds of getting to it are pretty good.  I suspect I may never play Chronica Feudalis or Solomon Kane, in part due to lessened interest and in part because I'd want to play them as an ongoing thing and suspect I won't find anyone who'd like to do that.<br/><br/>Speaking of ongoing things if I make a new list I'll probably have about the same "success" rate of 40% a year or so after.  At best.  I like variety but I've also come to appreciate more re-playing the same games over again.  I played 30-something games of Apocalypse World.  I played Fate 2.0 hacks, Love in the Time of Sei\xf0 and other Archipelago II hacks, Microscope, S/Lay w/Me and Danger Patrol several times each.  I played The War of the Ring boardgame 19 times in the last year.  This behavior doesn't leave much time to get to all the games I want to play.<br/><br/>A lot of my "variety gaming" comes from playtesting something that comes along that isn't on my radar until it suddenly is.  Or whatever the hot new game is that people are excited to try.  Most of the games that make up my top 5 at any snapshot are not ones enough people will make time for.  They've got their own lists of completely different games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335394/#Comment_335394" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T13:44:05+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  1:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>Wow, my list surprised me!<br/><br/>1.
