One skill from the game <i>Drakar och demoner</i> (eng. Dragons and Demons) was called Sense Danger where the character could start feeling uneasy if nearby a trap, ambush, or any similar danger. As a game master, I wrote their values in the skill so I could roll them behind the game master screen. I later moved on to rolling these in advantage, because my adventures at the time were more sequential so I knew they would arrive at certain places that needed checks. By eliminating the rolls, the description of the place got a better flow. Finally, I just looked at the highest value and gave them the information they acquired without any rolls.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I realized this other day that this was something that the game master used more than the players - to give out information to them.<br/><br/>What other kind of character traits (or whatnot) are there that only the game master uses?<br/><br/>(As an example, the sources of flags are used by <i>both</i> the players [as skills]  and the game master [as adventure material] and that's not what I'm looking for.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448780/#Comment_448780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-27T15:59:20+00:00" title="September 27, 2015  3:59PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my Pendragon group (long ago), it was "recognize," "heraldry," "awareness", and "intrigue".

The techie person has a move that kicks in when someone asks them for advice. Similar thing in "Nerver av st\xe5l", which you've played. The game doesn't have a GM, but the Silvertongue's ability can only be activated by other players. As long as their hearts card is face up, they cannot act against her. They can decide to flip it, which means they're vulnerable to her in conflicts (but they can now act against her). The Silvertongue never interacts with that ability herself.<br/><br/>But again, these are abilities only used by other players, not the GM, so maybe not what you're looking for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448785/#Comment_448785" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-28T09:27:23+00:00" title="September 28, 2015  9:27AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2015 9:47AM by Rickard.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a>: It's applicable in this thread.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Some things that I didn't roll for: <br/><b>Search:</b> I just said the clues to the one with the highest value whenever they entered the room.<br/><b>Leadership:</b> the one who were the leader in the group (or had a correlating skill/attribute) were the one who got contacted for quests, or addressed when talking to the whole group.<br/><b>Charisma:</b> people revealed things to the character with the highest Charisma.<br/><b>Intelligence:</b> the one with the highest Intelligence got the most clues.<br/><b>Luck:</b> the most luckiest characters stumbled upon things, when there were things to be stumbled upon.<br/><br/>What I realized when thinking about this was that I used these things as tools to describe the environment for the players. "And you, Hawkeye, notices how they are wearing armor underneath their clothes." I had these things written down and just picked one or two of the characters, or switched between them, with the highest values and addressed them with more information. You could also switch this around. Someone with the lowest luck were the one who stepped into traps, as an example, or someone with a low Charisma (or related skill) met people that were harder to persuade.<br/><br/>I also wrote down stuff that they did so they could be recognized for it later, possibly even be the reason why they got a certain quest.<br/><br/>So you could probably design a subsystem around that. Imagine having five of these things on the character sheet, and then having the players assign values between 1-5 between them. It would say something about the character but mostly be a tool for the game master.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448786/#Comment_448786" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-28T13:37:13+00:00" title="September 28, 2015  1:37PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a>: How did you use them as a game master?

Perhaps they might know them in advance because of the NPC's glory, or family resemblance to someone they already knew.  "Awareness" was just for detecting things, sort of like your "sensing danger" skill.

Anything where the player would certainly know whether they've succeeded or failed, I let them roll.<br/><br/>That's my first interpretation for your Sense Danger roll -- if the players fail to sense danger, you don't want them to know that's what happened, because knowing that would in fact tell the player something the character doesn't know -- that there is danger!  Groups and GMs who don't care about player/character knowledge separation would just let the player roll.<br/><br/>My second interpretation, though, is that maybe some of your GM rolls function like classic random event tables, but somewhat character-based instead of completely random.  That seems fun.  "This room could have been full of any Level 2 monsters, but because the paladin here is a sworn enemy of bugbears, the room is 17% more likely to be full of those!  Time to roll!"<br/><br/>More generally, I think operating outside the agency of a given character player yields all sorts of neat design options.  In <i>Penny for My Thoughts</i>, there are no dice, but there is still the situation where other people are deciding what your character did in the past.  In <i>Unknown Armies</i>, if you fail a Stress check, the GM takes over your character for a bit.  There are also games where you roll to see if your character can overcome their own psychological barriers to take the action they intend -- this strikes me as the sort of roll that could easily be handed off to the GM.  ("I charge into the horrific dungeon room!"  "Your legs refuse to obey.  You stumble and your vision swims...")  I could also see the GM making D&amp;D saving throws for this reason (unconscious rather than conscious use of character abilities).<br/><br/>Agency aside, I also like your use of character comparison as spotlight guide.  When it's time to reveal environmental subtleties, tell the generally perceptive character; when it's time to reveal ancient signs, tell the history expert; when it's time to reveal NPC deception, tell the manipulator; etc.  And then when someone's going to be the first one sneak-attacked, look to the worst Luck stat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448799/#Comment_448799" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-29T04:10:55+00:00" title="September 29, 2015  4:10AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to mention that there are some forms of gaming where pretty much ALL the mechanics are like this.<br/><br/>The GM rolls dice and handles the "system" behind the screen, while the players can only interact with the fiction directly.<br/><br/>(In such games, an oft-seen concept is that the players are actually playing "themselves" in this virtual reality.)<br/><br/>Also, surely there are variations of playstyles of Fate-type games where the GM can "compel" character Traits but the players don't use them themselves. (A simple example is a character Aspect like "I always seem to draw the wrong person's attention", which the player never activates, but the GM makes extensive use of.

When it's time to reveal environmental subtleties, tell the generally perceptive character; when it's time to reveal ancient signs, tell the history expert; when it's time to reveal NPC deception, tell the manipulator; etc.  And then when someone's going to be the first one sneak-attacked, look to the worst Luck stat.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448805/#Comment_448805" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-29T12:50:08+00:00" title="September 29, 2015 12:50PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This board's software makes me crazy.  So, it embedded my comment in my quotation of your comment.  And I can't edit it now.<br/><br/>So here's the gist (with some added reflection).  The third thing you say about a game system where characters are over-coming their psychological barriers being so cool?  Pendragon was doing that thirty years ago with its Personality Traits; and Passions.  It was really a game well ahead of it's time, and one of the early progenitors of story-games.  I'm surprised that story-gamers talk about it so rarely.  Given what was happening on the RPG scene 30 years ago, it was a remarkable achievement.  And people are still playing it today, as far as I can tell.  Greg Stafford deserves a lot more praise than he ever gets.  He lovingly crafted Glorantha (arguably the most detailed campaign setting of all time), founded Chaosium Games (one of the best gaming companies of an era); and designed the Pendragon Personality and Passions overlay for the BRP (which really takes it to another level, or another direction: a story-game direction).  Sure there were other people helping, but holy crap man--that's an amazing contribution  {/end crazy old man diatribe}                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448807/#Comment_448807" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-29T13:03:34+00:00" title="September 29, 2015  1:03PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was addressing that last post above to Dave_Berg; but of course I can't edit my post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448809/#Comment_448809" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-29T14:23:52+00:00" title="September 29, 2015  2:23PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a>: Roll over your post, click the little gear thingie that appears in the upper-right.

I think by the rules this is a player roll, but I could easily see it as a GM roll.  It's an interesting in-between -- partly (a) involuntary, automatic response that may get you in trouble, but also partly (b) principle-based action which might correspond to a stat increase you actually want.  For most players, sometimes you want to "pass" the roll, other times you want to "fail" it -- right?<br/><br/>Agreed that Stafford deserves a lot of love.  Pendragon has never been a regular topic around here, but it's had a few gushing threads over the years, like <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14481/king-arthur-pendragon-weirdness-before-weirdness-was-cool" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448829/#Comment_448829" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-30T15:57:48+00:00" title="September 30, 2015  3:57PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked that 5e brought things like this back for me, who had never seen it in use before. My experience in RPGs started with 3.5 and VtM with GMs and groups that considered this practice unfair so didn't used it. But when I readed in 5e that you could get a better narration flow by writing down things like the passive perception value of the PCs and just check it when needed without rolling the dice, I started applying it too to the AC. Next time I play I'll make sure alignments and charisma are also considered this way.

I know it's a hairy subject for many but in light of the OP, this is definitely one of those things the GM pays attention to in a very different way than the Player does.<br/><br/>In my main AD&amp;D campaign (which ran for a little over a decade), I used alignment charts and actively tracked the characters' alignment positions over time.  Highly mathematical, this was one sheet that was never shown to Players.  A PC's align position would directly affect their chances of success when involved with anything that had to do with their deities.  I would give Players warnings when they began drifting close to the edge of an alignment boundary - things like dreams and omens portending deific dissatisfaction or highlighting moral dilemmas - but they wouldn't know for sure that a line had been crossed until their deity stopped responding.<br/><br/>PS - Love Stafford.
