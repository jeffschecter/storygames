Inside Jesse mentioned that the state doesn't change when you miss, and then Brand mentioned the frustration of three rounds in a row where both their character and their opponent kept missing (and the fiction remained static).<br/><br/>And I asked myself, why are we rolling to hit (this is similar to Vincent asking, why do we roll to hit <i>and</i> for damage). Why not just declare who we hit, and then roll for damage?<br/><br/>In a game like D&amp;D, it would mean a few changes of course. First up, you'd need more hit points, since you'll get hit every round (as would your enemies). And you'd probably have to reconfigure the way damage is calculated since with AC gone you'd have to have a new way to make armour and Dexterity and Strength to hit bonuses relevant. I'm thinking something like die number and die size, with bonuses to defence lowering either die size or die number, and bonuses to offence either increasing the number of dice rolled or the type of dice rolled. But never letting damage go below 1d4. So that the current situation always changes after any attack.<br/><br/>EDIT: There's something here that might be really unclear. I was thinking that to calculate damage, you'd roll dice, and well, which dice and how many would depend on a few factors. So a 6th level fighter of average strength with a magic sword might roll 3d10 for damage, but a 6th level fighter of incredible strength with a magic sword might roll 3d12. That kind of thing. And if that first fighter struck another fighter in full-plate, the roll might actually be 1d10 for damage instead of 3d10 (because that's what armour would do, reduce the number of dice rolled).<br/><br/>Note all the numbers and die sizes are made up because I haven't put a lot of thought into this, it's just a little idea.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177723/#Comment_177723" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T14:23:54+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  2:23PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2008 2:30PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen two easy fixes for this sort of thing, in a "fighty" system:<br/><br/>1. We roll. The winner hits the loser. None of that "we both miss each other" stuff.<br/><br/>2. You always do a certain amount of damage, like you say. Many options here:<br/><br/>* Reducing your opponent's ability to stay in the fight (like removing hit points, doing Harm, etc--Dogs in the Vineyard actually works like this).<br/>* The defender has options about how to deal with the "damage" or "threat". Maybe you can spend some Dodge points to dodge the attack instead of taking it to your hit points, but then you get a penalty next round equal to the number of points you spent, representing how you had to throw yourself out of the way.<br/>* Instead of hitting your opponent, you're rolling to build up an advantage over them, that you can eventually use to strike them down (games like Red Box Hack, Sorcerer, etc, all do this to some degree).<br/><br/>I think you'll find this problem is rare in most recent designs, especially the ones usually discussed here.<br/><br/>Hey, are there any "whiffy" story games?

No matter what you roll though, it changes the game and the situation. <br/><br/>D&amp;D, however, is a gambling game with a lot of resource management going on. On any given action you're taking a chance that you'll get to have an affect with that action, often balanced against how much of an effect you can have if successful. (This isn't always evenly balanced, of course). The chance that you might waste resources and have them not affect the situation is very tied into the whole distribution of resources in the game. So taking out the chance of waste is really going to make you recalc everything from the ground up. <br/><br/>However, doing so could be cool. I've never played 3:16 but I remember reading a bit about how you don't roll to hit bugs, you roll to see how many bugs you kill with a given attack. Even if that isn't the way it works, I thought it was interesting. The question becomes not "do I have an effect" but "how much effect do I have" and possibly "is it enough."<br/><br/>(I also wonder if the "is it enough" could lead to its own feelings of frustration with the game -- I mean, we can all get our hopes and expectations up about things and feel disappointed when they fail. So even taking out the miss chance might leave that frustrating wiff feeling for folks who really thought their guy should do better.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177740/#Comment_177740" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T18:45:49+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  6:45PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>The thing about it with D&amp;D is that the way the resources work is going to have to be totally revamped if you take the miss chance away.</blockquote>\nTo be clear, I'm not thinking of this as a mod to D&amp;D.

I was just using the terminology of D&amp;D because that's all I really have for this right now (I don't have a lot of experience with fighty games, having not played any since I played D&amp;D twenty years ago). \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/>However, doing so could be cool.

And I've had the same thing you described in D&amp;D happen in 3:16, which is a series of nothing turns where no one successfully changes the state of the game.<br/><br/>However, the "is it enough" thing you mention, that's what I was thinking the shift would be towards, yes. It would still be a question of resources, it would just be using them in a different fashion. And the difference I see is, while you may end up being disappointed with your results, you would still see a shift in the state of the game. The resources possessed by you and your enemy would not be in an identical state to that which they were when your turn started (although they could be functionally identical, which is something that would have to be tested if this were to ever become more than a Little Idea).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177742/#Comment_177742" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T19:13:38+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  7:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, <br/><br/>Cool. I like this little idea. <br/><br/>I think a lot of games that have stakes or conflict resolution are taking a stab at something like this (and many other things at the same time, of course.) Like Jesse said back in the other thread, in a game with conflict resolution if you "miss" it doesn't mean you wait until next round to try again, it means that thing isn't going to happen and that should make the fiction shift dramatically. Similarly, for all that they're in disfavor now, in a lot of stakes games you have a setup of "if I win somethiing happens, if I lose something happens, so either way we won't zero sum because of the roll." <br/><br/>The thing is I don't think that those are necessary to this little idea of yours. I think as long as you're rolling forward, as long as every roll is going to have full effect upon the fiction, then neither stakes nor simple pass/fail conflicts are necessary. You can chip away, you can roll forward without knowing what will come next, and it should all be awesome, just so long as no matter where you are after you've rolled the dice it cannot be the same place you were as before. <br/><br/>Hmm.

When I engage the rules, I kind of want something to happen. Certainly if I go through a few iterations of a small cycle of rules (let's say a few turns in a fight), I'd like to think the state of the fiction (or the tactical situation) isn't identical to the one we had before we started those iterations. Which, yes, does sound a lot like why have conflict resolution rules in the first place. To make sure something relevant happens in the fiction. <br/><br/>I'm sure my Little Idea is far from perfect, but that's the goal, to make sure things are moving forward after we engage with the rules.<br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>I don't play computer games, but yes this sound like what I'm talking about. Staying in a fight would mean your hit points are going down, the longer the fight lasts (either because you stay in it or you have yet to win it), the more they would go down [EDIT: Unless, of course, no one attacks you.].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177754/#Comment_177754" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T01:24:45+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  1:24AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One interesting way I've seen of doing this is In Tunnels and Trolls.

Which ones are they?</blockquote>\nSidestepping the jargon thing because I get what you're aiming at, a few examples pop to mind:<br/><br/>Dust Devils has an unfortunate "nothing really happened" element to it when you elect to fold. Yeah, it costs a chip to fold but you can also, easily, zero that out by framing your draw such that you're defying one of your traits (IIRC) and drawing a chip. The effect of folding on the game fiction is not well explained in the text, so we were never really sure what was happening, other than mechanically.<br/><br/>3:16 can turn into a frustrating die-rolling exercise if the losers don't put any effort into describing what their failures look like. Granted that's breaking the rules, but it's an incredibly easy rule to break (esp. once it's happened a couple times and everyone just wants to get on with finishing the encounter). So, not exactly a failure of the RAW, but it takes a strong GMing hand IMO to make sure the failures are shaping the fiction.<br/><br/>Burning Empires can be frustrating when nobody succeeds at their Infection roll. I think that's a phenomenon of the quirky fiction-Infection disconnect in that game: the Maneuver can be a great success but it might not be reflected in the Infection. With one of my BE groups, that just amped the tension up. With another, which tended to play more expansive Maneuvers, it was just frustrating as heck.<br/><br/>In Spirit of the Century, pounding on each other's Stress track can be a long, slow die rolling exercise. I think it can lead to creative fatigue as well, since the game mechanically requires you dump a lot of creativity into each roll. The straight-to-conditions variant posted by Fred bypasses this very nicely. The thing is, there's plenty going on in the fiction as you're tapping and creating aspects like mad! But the actual resolution is held at arm's length for too long despite all the effort.<br/><br/>Anyway, I see this happening still. Nothing like the hours of pointless die rolling in the past, though.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177772/#Comment_177772" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T09:36:00+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  9:36AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should read that link to "Eldritch", above.

In such a system you could have different fatigue costs for different sorts of attacks and even maneuvers that would allow you to recover fatigue.<br/><br/>In the OD&amp;D community of the time*, at least, this idea was not taken particularly seriously, partly, I suspect because of an assumption that if a player <em>wanted</em> to play a resource-management intensive character, they'd already be playing a spell caster of some sort, and that the players of fighters were drawn to them in part because they were so simple mechanically to play.<br/><br/>(* At least as represented by the APA community: <i>Alarms &amp; Excursions</i> and <i>The Wild Hunt</i>.  The idea might have been taken more seriously elsewhere.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177780/#Comment_177780" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T11:06:37+00:00" title="November  8, 2008 11:06AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Selene Tan</cite>One interesting way I've seen of doing this is In Tunnels and Trolls.

First up, you'd need more hit points, since you'll get hit every round (as would your enemies). And you'd probably have to reconfigure the way damage is calculated since with AC gone you'd have to have a new way to make armour and Dexterity and Strength to hit bonuses relevant.</blockquote>\nSo, one thing I was kinda toying around with long ago when I was messing with a "Tactics" style game (Simulation RPG, like FF Tactics, Disgaea etc) was to emulate the system more and decrease handling times by basically using no attack rolls, simply damage rolls. Most tabletop games put you into the pants of a single character, so the console style "I take 30 hits and all that I have to show for it is that my life bar is down about a third" method really, REALLY tends to break immersion, I think. Over its knee. And casts it aside like a broken doll.<br/><br/>But, if you were to sort of embrace that console quirkiness, you could maybe rely on damage rolls only, and keep careful track of things like potions, heal spells and the like.<br/><br/>Like, in a recent thought I had, the damage roll would look something like this: First, I'd have the character add up all the damage they do due to stats and stuff (all the level up bonuses, natural stats, etc), then of course you have your fat weapon bonuses which spiral upwards and upwards as the game progresses.<br/>So say you add all that up, and the result is "24" for a mid-level character.<br/><br/>I'd probably come up with something that looked like this: When you attack, roll a 1d10:<br/>1 miss<br/>2 12<br/>3 12<br/>4 18 (or 24)<br/>5 24<br/>6 24<br/>7 24<br/>8 30 (or 36)<br/>9 36<br/>10 Double Damage<br/><br/>Then streamline things like, "For every level your opponent is higher than you, subtract one from your roll".<br/>"If you are using an element that is comparable to the enemy's element, subtract three. If you are using an element that is contrary to the enemy, add three".<br/><br/>But then, of course, you need to be willing to put yourself through the "I take 10 bullets and am still wading through enemies" immersion-breaking. Also, you need to have comparable heal spells, potions, etc and keep careful track of them.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177805/#Comment_177805" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T16:50:37+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  4:50PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2008 4:53PM by Burr.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Selene Tan</cite>One interesting way I've seen of doing this is In Tunnels and Trolls.

Rather than skills, characters have commitments.  The more a character commits themselves to love/swordplay/whatever, the worse they'll get hurt if someone beats them at it (or with it).  And the more they go all in with their commitments, the more they committed they become (or the reverse, if they are wishy-washy with their alleged commitments).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
