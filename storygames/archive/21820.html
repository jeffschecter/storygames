I have LOTS of feelings about this, but I'll try summarize a few here.<br/><br/>Basically, if you want to get into D&amp;D-ish design and publishing (or to continue doing it), there are all sorts of things that you can release as a game/product, and many of them are pretty accessible for people to produce or are the product of things you'd already create as a GM for a campaign.<br/><br/>- an adventure<br/>- a single really cool location<br/>- a few really useful/evocative tables<br/>- some monsters<br/>- some cool treasures or other items<br/>- some hextiles (this has been a thing recently)<br/><br/>Those are all potentially stand-alone, small products (or free releases, whatever) because they can be picked up and slotted into stuff that other people are already doing, or just enjoyed as evocative inspiration for other folks to riff on.<br/><br/>It's interesting, though, to think about what the equivalent is for Weird Games (by which I mean non-D&amp;D indie games that range from more-trad to more-experimental, freeform larp, and whatever else). The options I can think of include:<br/><br/>1. Supplemental material for a popular and well-established game system/line, like Fate or Dungeon World or (now) Blades in the Dark. It's easier to do it for an open-source system, but usually you can just ask the designer's permission to make something for a non-open game (though not everybody knows this or has the connections to do it). Even then, though, there's much less of an established tradition in terms of what these kinds of mini-products look like, what you do with them, and how you distribute/sell them.<br/><br/>2. Hacking an existing game into a new game, either one that's pretty close or one that's further afield. Depending on the scope of what you're doing, this can be a quick-and-dirty project or something that's as much work as making your own game from scratch, but at least it often comes with a little bit of a built-in audience (fans of the game you're hacking). Though not always.<br/><br/>3. Participating in Game Chef or some other "game jam" (as they're now called in digital games circles), which gives you the excuse to finish a stand-alone game in a short window of time, as well as maybe getting a little bit of attention from judges and other participants. But I think we're often not very good at helping people figure out what to do with their contest games after the fact. Is it just design practice? Should they play it with other folks? Should they publish it?<br/><br/>4. Contribute a short game to an anthology or zine. This is honestly one of the best ways to do it, in my experience, but there aren't many of these kinds of projects (though they're semi-regular now) and I'm not sure how much the games in anthologies actually get played. They are really fun collaborative projects, though, where you team up with other game designers and pretty easily begin thinking of yourself as one.<br/><br/>5. Designing a micro-game or a fairly short stand-along game. This is maybe still an emerging option but one that is gaining ground I think, thanks in part to the 200-Word RPG contest, Vincent's excursion into micro-game design (due to the massive amount of attention &amp; legitimacy his work gets), as well as the rise of Patreon, some developments in feminist/queer analog games, and so on. Small games are becoming cool again, I think/hope, including as things to actually play, not just as "RPG poems" to appreciate intellectually. But it's something that we could definitely find ways to support more. In some ways, it's the option on this list that I'm most excited about, but I've been excited about a lot of developments that haven't gone anywhere. There are a couple of sub-versions of this approach, though...<br/><br/>6. This is more like 5b, but designing a freeform larp is sometimes very similar to designing a micro-game, due to the single-session format at the lack of really complex rules. You often are designing a "scenario," so it's longer and there are often more materials than in a micro-game, but not so much in terms of mechanical/rules design. There are actually rules in freeform larp (despite claims otherwise!), but they are fairly minimalist. But the commercial market for freeform larp is still pretty dern small, despite Jason Morningstar's success in Kickstarting them by disguising them as board/card/party games (Ghost Court, etc.). That's okay, but getting into the circles where people trade cool larps around can be tricky if you're not going to the same conventions as everyone else.<br/><br/>7. This is more like 5c, but prestige-format small-ish games are also potentially a thing, considering the reception of games like The Quiet Year and Fall of Magic. Short, relative simple games with really interesting materials often get a lot more attention than small games that are just a PDF file or a blog post. But again, I'm not sure whether newer designers are likely to walk in and feel confident enough to launch one of these projects early on, at least without mentorship and support from folks who are familiar with how to put a materials-heavy project together.<br/><br/>8. As some of the recent comments here have shown, a lot of folks (myself included) have become fairly disenchanted with many aspects/approaches to commercial game publishing and/or game publishing in general. Rather than trying to reach as many folks as possible and trying to develop a community of players around our games, I feel like at least some folks are more and more content to make and play stuff with/for their local communities and/or a few handfuls of friends and contacts on the internet. Part of this, I think, is the so-called "indiepocalypse" (as they say in digital games), where people feel like there are way too many games out there for anyone to possible play, but it's also because a lot of the tasks involved in commercial game publishing (and even non-commercial publishing that aims for a large audience) are unpleasant or stressful. For something that we got into as a fun hobby, should we even push ourselves to take on all this unpleasantness, if the benefits/audience might not be all that big? But I'm not sure there's really a model/understanding of what the various options for low-key, non-commercial, non-outreach-focused game publishing might look like. Sure, you can just throw your stuff up on a website/blog/DriveThru/POD and not care too much about whether people find it or not, but that's not so much a new model of game distribution so much as it's doing traditional commercial/non-commercial publishing in a way that's not going to work very well, using those same old approaches, just badly.<br/><br/>9. I'm sure JD's going to walk into this thread and say: don't publish at all. Just make stuff for your local players and play them. And he's not wrong about that, but I also really like to make cool things and to share them with other people a bit more broadly, so I feel conflicted about that as well.<br/><br/>So I'm still searching -- and maybe other folks are too -- for a way to publish my stuff in a way that feels sustainable and semi-healthy.<br/><br/>(Note: I'm kind of playing fast-and-loose here by combining (1) types of game things/products with (2) types of distribution/publishing methods, but I feel like they have a closely intertwined relationship. After all, the form that our games take is often what restricts us to distributing them through particular channels, and vice versa.)                </div>

                            Some good observations. I definitely agree with the point about how it's a lot clearer what you can do if you want to start publishing content for D&amp;D style things. Theres a very established tradition there. Thought I'd share my own anecdote surrounding this.<br/><br/>I started up a blog last year and even though I'm heavily into the Weird Games in terms of my actual play, the blog content has been by and large D&amp;D-ish. Ive gotten really good results from sharing these posts on places like reddit. It's a good avenue for getting lots of eyes on your stuff, and at least for me, a big advantage (in terms of time spent) is that its essentially a creative writing exercise rather than a design one. Most of the mechanical aspects of the things I've written posts about: Monsters, Items, Plot Hooks, etc. all have strong foundations in the rules of the games so I don't even have to go into the mechanics most of the time.<br/><br/>The one fairly popular post I had that was related to Weird Games was a One Page RPG, which I think is an equally consumable form of content that can attract lots of eyes as well. The difference was, while the other posts took me maybe an hour or two to write and edit, this was a full game I was designing and doing fancy layout for. <br/><br/>So if I'm going for numbers, I can definitely expend far less effort on a D&amp;Dish post for about the same reward as a piece of Weird Game design.                        </div>

                            I don't see why, say, a one-page PDF supplement of a supervillain, a scenario where they attack your LITTLE SISTERS SCHOOL, and a cool collectible card you can throw down on the table when they show up wouldn't be useful for Masks, or some weird psychic threat for Apocalypse World. I mean, nobody would buy it and nobody would want it (except me) but since nobody is the target audience, just call it a success!                        </div>

                            I edit an OSR zine. I have gotten submissions from people trying their wings for the first time, checking the winds. One of the writers has even graduated to posting full adventures on DriveThruRPG independently.<br/><br/>Perhaps that could be a way for others.

                            I design games, then run them at cons. Sometimes they get written down and sort-of published (by which I mean there's a PDF available for download. I used to do physical books, but haven't in a while. Maybe I will again.). This does get broader reach than just playing it with my home group, and I also get to discuss the game with other people who like making games, and try their games as well. It's great. There are a bunch of people scattered all over the country who play my games sometimes, because they played them at a convention and wanted to play it at home, too.                        </div>

                            I think it's odd to have design/publish slash-connected here. These are totally different things and totally different motivations.<br/><br/>For example, if my motivation is publication then I have a desire to be seen. Advice along the lines of "don't publish, don't be seen" is denying the whole premise.<br/><br/>How can you easily design? See, disconnected from "publish" that's trivial: just go ahead.<br/><br/>How can you easily publish? Print-on-demand and PDF publication through the Usual Outlets is still the easiest and cheapest way to do this. It's out of fashion, but it remains the most practical. But it still doesn't quite get at the nub: how can I be seen? DTRPG used to be a good bet but now the wealth of material there pretty much guarantees your invisibility. Kickstarter guarantees visibility but there's nothing simple nor cheap about it.<br/><br/>I have no answer. I'm looking for one. How come we could do this and be so very visible in 2009 but now the same methods go nowhere? I reach more people now than ever before for low effort and generate fewer actual sales.                         </div>

A FAE sci-fi quick start, a small time-loop RPG, an adventure sandbox for Traveller/Cepheus Engine, and a polished up GameChef entry.

I am pretty ignorant of the market for Weird Games supplements.  Honestly, I don't know much about how D&amp;D supplements reach an audience or don't.  At least, not the kind I could make -- "here's a neat magic system" as opposed to "here's a lavish campaign guide."  Much food for thought...                        </div>

I would contend that most of those things aren't explicitly necessary to publish, it's only common sense that stops people (sometimes) from publishing without them. You can publish an unplaytested, poorly written, poorly laid out, unmarketed game if you really want to, and nobody else really has a say in it.                        </div>

Well, that's a bit of a problem, right? I mean, I'm a bit lazy myself ( so a lot of times, my designs are never truly finished), but I'd certainly want folks at least reading my stuff and getting an idea of the concepts, even if they weren't actively playing them..<br/><br/><br/>Why though? Because when I go further with the concepts, I want people to have a basic understanding of the previously written/developed bit.<br/><br/>I'm mostly following this thread to see if anyone has come up with solutions to that situation, and applied it where commercial success even at basic, low levels was never a major interest on the part of the designer.<br/><br/><br/>Getting to a question I asked earlier, has anyone just used videos to demo their concepts? It seems like the closest equivalent to the way many people actually learn face-to-face, far more than delving into any text initially. I know I've personally "learned" a couple of different games initially without much more than verbal explanations, a character sheet ( if applicable) and maybe a Quick Reference Sheet (QRS).<br/><br/><br/>In fairness, I realize that shooting and distributing video certainly doesn't sound easier or less expensive than text/print  based explanation fore the creator/designer, but would it be easier on the other end, that of the user? Would that ease of (initial) use and introduction make the concepts easier to spread?<br/><br/><br/>I'm still thinking in terms of the designer ( me) not really seeking any ( initial) monetary reward for the effort, so it would be a bit different from some types of demoes for commercial products. A bit more like a cross between instructional videos and video APs.<br/><br/>It seems like this would make it easy also to keep texts lighter ( they tend more towards QRSes anyway at that point) and also make changes/revamps to the rules/procedures a bit easier.<br/><br/>Anyone have thoughts or experience with this?<br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            I'm not really sure I can imagine what the thing you're describing would even look like.<br/><br/>On one hand, I am one of those people who's radically against the "pivot to video," I often have a hard time sitting still and focusing on audiovisual content, and retaining the information therein. I also think that it tends to make very awful reference material if you need to go back and look at something you didn't understand or forgot, though that might just be a result of the fact that indexing of videos doesn't seem to have reached the level of normative practice yet.<br/><br/>That's not to say I hate video completely and find it altogether useless, though. Matt Colville's videos are really enjoyable,for example, although he tends to be more about tips/ideas/advice. I mean, I know on S-G some of us often use the transitive property to suggest that those are essentially the same as rules, but what you're describing almost feels different enough to cast that definition into question.<br/><br/>I've been really big lately on the potential of Actual Play to transmit conventions of play in a way that written rules often fall flat on. I think there's definitely something actionable in what you're talking about, but I also see lots of stumbling blocks.                        </div>

                            If there is an ethical way to stream a tabletop RPG, it certainly is in the field of education - teaching a particular way to play a particular game.

                            If one of the central tenets of a game (that is to say, a hypothetical game; I'm not trying to claim that this is a universal aspect of storygaming/roleplaying) is to produce an entertaining experience, then I don't see why you'd have to shuffle entertainment back behind the curtain in order to produce exemplars of play for the purpose of learning.<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be entertainment either; I imagine that, at least ideally, your teaching examples could easily fulfill the same purposes that the game itself is suppose to fulfill. And even if they don't manage to produce that vicarious experience in the non-participant watcher, it's not like our own play always succeeds at doing what we want/what we think the game wants, either.                        </div>

                            Enh, I watch how-to videos for all kinds of stuff, put up by happy amateurs on YouTube regularly. I imagine that something similar could be done for RPGs and related games.<br/><br/>Now, I do like JDC's last comment about D&amp;D streams immediately dumping the system as written. That plays right back into yukamichi's comment about how what 'm positing would be a bi of a different animal. I mean, those videos are showing the results of "actual" system, no? Not the one in the book, but the ( unexplained, unexamined) actual system. It shouldn't be terribly hard to jump from that to instructional videos.<br/><br/>I'm not saying do without text entirely, by why not go with a much smaller text, basically just QRFs for details after you've watched the video(s).                        </div>

Yeah, I suspect that's more of a problem with the "mainstream" (sub-)culture(s) of D&amp;D than a problem with the craft of making entertaining videos <i>per se</i>. Obfuscating the actual system at work appears to be a big thing in RPGs - that doesn't seem to have changed much since the 1990s (when I "learnt" how to play by the books then available), despite the availability of earnest alternatives. A "storygaming" AP video wouldn't (shouldn't), in principle, be like that, am I right? Or a <i>really</i> good OSR show, for that matter.<br/>(I'm a bit vague about it all because, fact is, I find it extremely boring and needlessly time-consuming to watch videos on the Internet, so I almost never do that.)<br/> </div>

                            With different sorts of craft and cooking videos ( the stuff I'm most likely to watch), usually there's a person who is not only showing what they're doing but also talking about <i>why</i> they're doing.<br/><br/>I'd imagine that an instructional RPG video would do something similar. I'm a technophobe, but is there some pause-and-go-to-another-related short-video method available? A bit like you make links in a text post when you basically want a more thorough discussion of a tangent or a better definition of a term, but then want to return to the main subject ?<br/><br/>Anyway, my thought was more about the whole paradox of non-commercial/free stuff/stuff just plain made to share also being less likely to be spread and played than more commercial stuff. I was thinking that showing the game rather than presenting a wall of text ( even if free text) might help with that.<br/><br/><br/>Less-commercially-oriented design may also be suffering a bit from the Death of The Magazine. At least with wargames, magazines used to provide an outlet to distribute those little 2-10 page rule sets to an audience that really only needed to know how your game was [different from stuff they already knew/how it was the same as stuff they already knew].<br/><br/>Those little rulesets don't seem to be as viable anymore nor get a whole lot of attention as either cheap or free downloads.<br/><br/>I know RPGs never much explored that sort of space in magazines ( with some notable exceptions), but this too may be a barrier in promoting non-commercial/less commercial games.<br/><br/>Anyone have thoughts on the subject?                        </div>

Youtube lets you add annotations, essentially overlays to a video that popup at a certain point that you can use to link to other content (I'm not sure if they only let you link to other videos on Youtube or if they also allow external links, though).<br/><br/>And obviously the whole sort of thing can get much more complex (in a good way) if you're delivering the content on your own platform. That technology has been around for decades—think digital multimedia encyclopedias like Encarta—and is easily doable with even just basic HTML knowledge.                        </div>

                            I figured something like that existed but I had just missed it, so thanks for pointing me in the right direction, yukamichi!<br/><br/><br/>So, on the broader point of non-commercial/low-commercial value stuff, what is everyone's motivation for interest in the subject of this thread?<br/><br/>For me, it's that while I'm passionate about my personal interests, and would love to share the neat stuff I think up with people who'd appreciate it, I'm also kinda lazy about follow through and have no real interest into turning my hobby into any sort of business, at least not initially and directly. I truly have no interest in developing a whole lot of new skills as a preliminary, nor in paying a whole lot to someone who has those skills for what amounts to a vanity project for me.<br/> </div>

                            I'm just catching up on an old thread, and I have some thoughts:<br/><br/><br/>First, I don't think it's any great coincidence that some of the most successful "indie RPGs" have included easy ways for other creators to publish material for them.<br/><br/><i>Fiasco</i> has "playsets", which are an easy thing to put together and publish. People make them and share and collect them.<br/><br/><i>Apocalypse World</i> has "playbooks", which are similarly created, shared, and collected. <br/><br/>This kind of thing allows all kinds of folks to get in on the action and to spread the visibility of the game in a way which a closed ruleset does not allow (at least not as naturally and as effortlessly).<br/><br/>Monsters, traps, and similar D&amp;Disms for <i>Dungeon World</i> also share a bit of this feature. (In addition to playbooks, of course.)<br/><br/><br/>Second, we've definitely discussed the issue of video tutorials for RPGs before... let me see if I can find one of the threads.<br/><br/>Ah! Here we go:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21527/tabletop-rpg-tutorial/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21527/tabletop-rpg-tutorial/p1</a><br/><br/>Some of my notes on creating "annotated actual play" videos for instructional purposes from the thread (note that the main goal is to keep the action quick and enjoyable to watch, while adding notes for the viewers to click on IF they want more information):
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Here's what I would love to see:<br/><br/>An "actual play" video of people playing a game, but with commentary. Perhaps, like YouTube annotations, there would be a little box you can click on, which, when pressed, pauses the video and shows a little bit of text: "Here's what the GM is thinking right now/Here are the player's options, and why she's chosen the fire attack/The group might have chosen to apply this rule instead, but that would require X, Y, and Z/The GM's prep doesn't show what's behind the door, so she's quietly rolling on a random table right now."<br/><br/>This could keep the video reasonably short but allow the viewer to "click in" for more detailed information and play tips as it goes along.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>[The content should be useful as a reference as well.]<br/><br/>My idea is that you could skip through parts you don't care about yet, and come back to them later. For instance, at first you just want to see how the game works: the player announces an action, perhaps, the GM announces a DC/target number, and then a roll is made. You might see that and click on "How does the player know which dice to roll?", and you're basically ready to go. <br/><br/>A month later, though, you're preparing to run your own game, so you go back to the video and the moment where that roll is made. But, this time, you click on "How does the GM know what DC/target number to use?", and read that little bubble (which may send you, with a hyperlink or page reference, to a particular page in the rulebook, perhaps). You no longer care about what dice to roll - you've internalized that part - so you can effectively skip straight to the part you're still trying to learn.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
Note that the video should also come with a hyperlinked "table of contents" - for instance, a block of text below the video's description (like on YouTube).<br/><br/>This will list topics, like "Difficulty Class", "Adjudicating Puzzles", "Initiative", and so forth. You can click on each one and it will take you to that portion of the video, and also serve as an index you can glance through when you can't remember whether this particular video features the Spellcasting Rules or not.<br/><br/> </div>
