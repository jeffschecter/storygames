It was inspired by an unfinished Skin on barf forth apocalyptica called the Nightmare but is it's own thing now. I think this Skin really reflects a better understanding of the game than my previous Skin the Monkey Prince (which I will revisit soon). I'd love to hear your thoughts about the Sandman.<br/><br/>The Sandman<br/><br/><i>You walk in a world of dreams and nightmares. Of black miracles and wondrous terrors shaped by those around you. You can see their potential but it's obscured by all the petty bullshit they keep inside. And you envy them anyway because they can dream and you can't. Your dreams are their dreams and it gets so hard to see the real world through the haze of dreamstuff.</i><br/><br/>Playing the Sandman<br/><br/>Darkest Self<br/><br/><i>You can see what they all want. What they all hide. Their guilt and their passion calls to you. So give it to them. What they want - what they deserve. Let them see how terrible it can be to have all their dreams come true. Come out of your Darkest Self when someone fulfills one of your desires.</i><br/><br/>Sex Move<br/><br/><i>When someone sleeps next to you they have vivid dreams. If they are good dreams they remove a Condition and you may ask them "What do you love?"

There are several moves that make people give you truthful answers about themselves, their feelings, fears, hopes, etc, which is an uncommon effect in the rest of Monsterhearts, I believe this is by design.  Personally I'd be cautious about a character skin in MH being able to easily know what others really feel, particularly one able to force people to divulge that information.<br/><br/>I've not had time to read all the moves, but mechanically, very few skins get 'one plus choose two' moves at the start, for the ones that do (like the Ghoul) the 'core' move may be a two edged sword, rather than a straight up benefit.<br/>One specific, in the Sex move, its not clear to me who or what process decides what the dreams are like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416822/#Comment_416822" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-22T09:02:06+00:00" title="June 22, 2013  9:02AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough. Allow me to do my best to answer these questions.<br/><br/>The teenager I'm modeling - and I need to add something to the rules to drive this home - is the kid everyone unburdens themselves on. That quiet kid with the nice smile who people always go to with their problems. The one who ends up spending too much time playing therapist without managing to stay out of their problems. The one who ends up with others secrets and the burden of what to do with them. Keep their trust or tell the truth?<br/><br/>I knew several kids like this in school and it always got messy for them. Teens suck with secrets. Especially hard ones.<br/><br/>Cneph - It is an uncommon effect in Monsterhearts but only uncommon. Not unknown. Much of MH's design is powered by asking pointed questions. I wanted a Skin that could ask questions in play. Push characters in different directions. But I did want to make the questions require leverage and thus the expenditures of Strings in lieu of Moves that allow them to ask questions. And I did limit what kinds of questions could be asked to prevent it from being the all knowing Skin.<br/><br/>I do think that I am going to change the core Move from Dreamwalking to Secret Keeper (a Move that currently only exists inside my head as I am coming up with it as I type but will push it towards the metaphorical teen I want to emulate) and then offer two others. And I will probably remove the gain a condition option from the 7-9 roll on Dreamwalking. If you get a String either way they should get more out of it than you getting tired.<br/><br/>I guess I didn't make that clear on the Sex Move. It is up to the Sandman whether they have sweet dreams or nightmares.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416826/#Comment_416826" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-22T10:37:20+00:00" title="June 22, 2013 10:37AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The teenager I'm modeling - and I need to add something to the rules to drive this home - is the kid everyone unburdens themselves on.

I didn't quite see it until you pointed it out, so you might want to slant the moves a little more towards that, and a little more towards the "self-made counselor".<br/><br/>Of course, what also might be hanging me up is the fact that I can't see "Sandman" without thinking of Morpheus, and he's rather the opposite of the counselor type.

I think there is promise in the burden-keeper concept.  As you've asked or feedback, personally, I'd not enjoy playing alongside a skin that is so heavily driven by forcing people to answer your questions, especially in a PvP biased game.  <br/><br/>The forcing mechanic also doesn't really say to me they are an inadvertent councillor.  While getting in others heads is not unknown in MH, it is limited for a reason, and provocative questions are the agenda of the MC, not the players.  This skin doesn't simply push gently on that door.  I'd suggest refocusing around moves that encourage and reward others for opening up to you (marking XP, removing or transferring conditions, etc). There is already the 'offer XP' mechanic inherent in Strings which doesn't remove player agency, but that does has it's own limitations.  A Sandman move maybe something like...<br/><br/>Trusted confidiante<br/>When someone shares a secret about another with you, they mark XP and you can if you want take a String on the snitch.<br/><br/>The idea being to create messy situations- someone has to gain a secret on another (generating play) and then share it (promising conflict).  I'm not quite sure on whether the Sandman gaining the string is necessary, i.e. whether there should be some risk for the snitch in sharing a secret, which is where playtesting would come in.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced Strings need to be 'powered up' by so many moves either.  The skin that does a little of this, the Fae, is all about Strings.  It seems like you want the Sandman to be all about secrets.<br/><br/>And you may want to check out the Hungry Ghost move and Playing notes, as it touches on related area, I feel.<br/><br/>I'm aware this sounds like mostly negative feedback, for which I apologise.  I do think there is an interesting concept with promise here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416854/#Comment_416854" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T02:22:47+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  2:22AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Darkest Self on this is amazing by the way.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416873/#Comment_416873" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T08:40:20+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  8:40AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darkest Self: How does one give someone his or her dreams come true?<br/><br/>Is it wrong that I am seeing Lucy Van Pelt as the Sandman?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416881/#Comment_416881" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T09:43:26+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  9:43AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Carpe - I'm I glad you like the concept.
