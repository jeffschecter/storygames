The scenario is reviewed on its wholeness with a distinct emphasis on the harmonious bridging of form and substance as well as potential and accessibility.<br/><br/><br/>Possessed // BZ\u2019at<br/>by Frikard Ellemand<br/><br/>A scenario with a high ceiling that bleeds into the players. Among punks and squatters of the 1980s a possessing love story unfolds. An intense and elegantly composed story about power and loss of control where substance and form play passionately together.<br/><br/>The Family // Familien<br/>by Max M\xf8ller<br/><br/>A mature and well framed scenario. The solid conflict invites the players to a game where the is no happy end - in a family not everyone can be happy at the same time. The players are given the responsibility to create a broken nuclear family and follow it into the abyss.<br/><br/>Sex, Drugs and Rock'n'Roll<br/>by Morten Jaeger<br/><br/>When Spruced Up takes to the stage the volume goes to 11; and when their diet of beer, vodka, and coke is spiced up with the newest brand of little faustian pills they loose all hint of restraint, stage fright, or even any semblance of connection to reality... and rocks the house. Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll is a well-designed scenario on exactly that. Sex. Drugs. Rock and Roll.<br/><br/><br/>Fifteen Men // Femten mand<br/>by Anders Troelsen, Niels Jensen, Simon Steen Hansen <br/><br/>A well-orchestrated tall tale of fifteen pirates and dead man\u2019s chest. The players sail through a sea of blood while trying to fight their way back to their port of call on Tortuga. The scenario walks the plank to deliver their players a string of war stories brimming with hidden treasures, grottos, wild savages, and blood-thirsty shipmates.<br/><br/><br/>Easter\u2013A Tragedy // P\xe5ske<br/>by Tim Slumstrup Nielsen<br/><br/>When this family sits down for the traditional early Easter Lunch and still cannot manage to talk of the things that really matter, the red herring more than gets stuck in the throat. It is also clue to start misleading the conversation and return it to safer straits... such as those on the dog, B\xf8lle.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Criteria includes innovation, a unique quality, courage or something completely different. The award is given for the overarching idea or a particular strong element of the scenario.<br/><br/>The Children from Playing Field 7 // B\xf8rnene fra Boldbane 7<br/>by Sally Khallash and Morten Greis Petersen<br/><br/>A grim story of a childhood touched by war. The scenario has an important message and insists on going about an otherwise challenging subject in a very nuanced way. Bridging an urgent and poignant theme with roleplaying it awards the players with an acute awareness of what it actually means to grow up in a city devastated by undiscriminating acts of war. <br/><br/>The Youth // De Unge<br/>by Magnus Udbj\xf8rg og Rasmus H\xf8gdall<br/><br/>The inspiring photographs snaps the players right in as co-creators of both their roles and the story they are about to tell. The scenario paints a picturesque scenery and cool situations and recognisable roles are conjured up by pictures and symbols alone.<br/><br/>Eiyuu Tachi<br/>by Michael Sonne-J\xf8rgensen<br/><br/>A fantastic imaginative world. In the Cluster\u2019s mushroom realm we encounter a wide range of outlandish creatures and monsters. When the Iron Witch sow new fresh eyes onto the onion on her  staff you will know that the Slump is on the prowl and if the Bone-skarrow is on YOUR tail then you had better jump the Feather-express and keep an open mind as to your destination... <br/><br/>Adam and his Friends // Adams Venner<br/>by Michael Erik N\xe6sby<br/><br/>The players and the gamemaster each possess their part of the key to unlock Adam\u2019s labyrinthine mind. None of them have the full picture of Perfect Adam\u2019s deepest desires. Throughout this game the traditional roles are turned upside down and unbeknownst to the players they are in fact gamemastering the gamemaster\u2019s own story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Narrative is here understood as both idea, content and narration. The judges also consider the originality and flow of the play.<br/><br/>A Heart of Metal // Et Hjerte af Metal<br/>By Sigrid Svane<br/>Opera and Metal clashes in arias of inspiration and love, where the Muse's magnamonious world of heavy metal, stands opposed to the soft french fries of daily life. Art and love is at the same time identical and completely incompatible. An excellent adaptation of Wagner's Tannh\xe4user.<br/><br/>The Family // Familien<br/>By Max M\xf8ller<br/><br/>A subtle depiction of an unhappy family, where the dreams and ambitions of the individual family member, is used as a piece in a unsolvable puzzle. No one can ever be happy in this family tragedy, where eveeryone is dependant on each other. A very relatable story for anyone.<br/><br/>The Shadow of the Hero // Heltens Skygge<br/>By Louise Floor Frellsen<br/>Daily life is interrupted for a while, when the hero passes by. An epic journey is the backdrop for a series of everyday stories, where heroics doesn't really matter. In this social realistic story the fantasy narratives of battles and magical castles takes the back seat-even the dragon dies with much notice.<br/><br/>Hunted Down<br/>By Andrej Tokarcik<br/><br/>Two stories of expectation, rearing and neglect crash in a car accident. From birth to burial, a father and son cast their focus on the great questions of the meaning of life. Which bad decisions do they make, when they are hunted down by fate.<br/><br/>Scrapbook // Scrapbog<br/>By Eva Fog<br/><br/>The dream of a child drives Mona towards madness and crime. Reality and imagination melts together on the pages of the scrapbook. In gray and pink snapshots a recognizable portrait of a desperate woman, that you never fully can understand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Emphasis will also be put on whether the roles are inspiring, engaging og convincing.<br/><br/>Adam and his Friends // Adams venner<br/>By Michael Erik N\xe6sby<br/>Adams invisible friends all fight for their survival in a battle between childhood and adult life. Pressed for time they keep themselves alive and Adam in check, because when Perfect Adam enters the play, the game is all of a sudden different. A crazy wierd language conveys the energy and spirit to characters full of popcultural referenxes all forged in the childish mind of Adam.<br/><br/>Possessed // BZ'at<br/>By Frikard Ellemand<br/>The frontlines are drawn sharply between The Possesive and The Pleasing love in a fight, where The Main Character is the battlefield for a merciless possession, that is as brutal as the nightsticks of the police. Truce is not an option in a tragedy, where the characters stands so naked, that the players  has to put their own clothes and experiences on them - and by doing so they themselves become naked and battered at the end.<br/><br/>Fifteen Men // Femten Mand<br/>By Anders Troelsen, Niels Jensen og Simon Steen Hansen<br/><br/>The fifteen pirates only fear the black sign and what the others will do to get their hands on the treasure. Dirty sailors, boatswains and first mates are full of rum, sea foam and death. In a short and concise way the players gets lots of atmosphere and inspiration to brutal murders.<br/><br/>Memoirs of a Hitman<br/>By Johannes Daa<br/>With the landscape as only judge, the rifle, the bullets and the icelandic bedrock melts together in the memoirs of the hitman and becomes living metaphors in a fogged memory of war and loss of innocence. Objects, people, and diffuse dreams all play a role in the man's total despair.<br/><br/>Leaves of Destiny // Sk\xe6bne-blade<br/>By Cecilie Balling og Tine Arbj\xf8rn<br/><br/>Classic roles are painted as deathmasks in minor. A velconstructed intrigue, where everyone has something on everyone, erects a gravestone to a story larger than life itself. The past is in play and gived all a new destiny, if they dare turn the page and go back. It is rare that such depraved people has been conveyed with such great immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

With physical play and the real-life experiences of the player the obsession creeps under the skin. The lover slowly loses possibilities and personal space as the loss of power becomes complete.<br/><br/>Eiyuu Tachi<br/>By Michael Sonne-J\xf8rgensen<br/><br/>The colorful and bubbly world comes to life when the historians tells of the Cluster and what is really at stake. Storytelling, curious traits and the Number of the Slump creates play and dangers for the poor creatures on a hapless quest for fantastic tales.<br/><br/>Fifteen Men // Femten Mand<br/>By Anders Troelsen, Niels Jensen og Simon Steen Hansen<br/><br/>The black sign, counter attacks and changing roles creates an effective game mechanic making each killing unique and colorful. By keeping other characters alive tactics, game and story becomes an integrated balance. <br/><br/>Easter\u2013A Tragedy // P\xe5ske<br/>By Tim Slumstrup Nielsen<br/><br/>Traditional Danish sm\xf8rrebr\xf8d and the repetitive Easter lunches becomes suffocating as the silence grows each year. The dog, the car and family cottage are safe subjects when keeping up appearances. If you talk about anything else the game stops and you are scolded - for you wouldn't want to spoil the good mood, would you?<br/><br/>Sex, Drugs and Rock'n'Roll<br/>By Morten Jaeger<br/><br/>Cue cards and tight scene structure creates twists and grotesque situations when the Rock'n'Roll universe takes over. The star stereotypes of the band explodes in roaring solos forgetting the other band members. For as the drugs enhance creativity the characters change perspective in completely different directions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.
