Rather than trying to analyze behavior after the fact or look at their character sheets for flags of what they might enjoy why not get to the things that motivate them?<br/><br/><a href="https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/lab/" rel="nofollow">Quantic Foundry Labs</a> has a couple of really cool tools for understanding player motivations. They provide a Gamer Motivation Profile and a Board Gamer Motivation Profile that both really cut to the core of what motivates us to play games. Both are short 5 minute surveys that provide a rather complete picture of motives rather than behaviors that we can than target with the right game and scenario designs.<br/><br/>The really cool thing is that all the ratings are based on percentiles ranked against the core population of video game and board game players so they give a good impression of where a given player sits. The other really cool thing is that you can create groups for a given survey and invite your fellow players to take the surveys. Once 5 people in a group have taken a survey it gives you a composite profile that shows areas of common interest that you can use to tailor your games to the group.<br/><br/>It's backed up by solid data science and social science. Quantic Foundry Labs was co-founded by Nick Yee, who spearheaded Project Daedalus, the MMO Analysis Project.<br/><br/>Here's an excerpt from my Gamer Motivation Profile\n<blockquote><br/><b>The Social Components (92%)</b><br/><br/>Gamers with high Social scores enjoy interacting with other players, often regardless of whether they are collaborating or competing with them. Gamers with low Social scores prefer solo gaming experiences where they can be independent.<br/><br/><b>Competition (86%):</b> Gamers who score high on this component enjoy competing with other players, often in duels, matches, or team-vs-team scenarios. Competitive gameplay can be found in titles like Starcraft, League of Legends, or the PvP Battlegrounds in World of Warcraft. But competition isn\u2019t always overtly combative; competitive players may care about being acknowledged as the best healer in a guild, or having a high ranking/level on a Facebook farming game relative to their friends.<br/><br/><b>Community (91%): </b>Gamers who score high on Community enjoy socializing and collaborating with other people while gaming. They like chatting and grouping up with other players. This might be playing Portal 2 with a friend, playing Mario Kart at a party, or being part of a large guild/clan in an online game. They enjoy being part of a team working towards a common goal. For them, games are an integral part of maintaining their social network.<br/></blockquote>\nHere are links to my profiles for perusal:<br/><br/>My Gaming Style is <a href="https://goo.gl/dW1Y5h" rel="nofollow"><b>Action-Oriented, Proficient, Relaxed, Social, and Deeply Immersed</b></a><br/><br/>My Board Gaming Style is <a href="https://goo.gl/LnBOvR" rel="nofollow"><b>High Conflict, Strategic, and Immersed</b></a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462075/#Comment_462075" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-18T13:01:51+00:00" title="April 18, 2017  1:01PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really have time to debate it in length this month, but my position on this sort of stuff is that it's not as useful as it may seem. (Or rather, it may not be useful in the way one might think, particularly on a forum like this.) The two main issues are as follows:<br/><br/><b>Affirmation bias</b><br/><br/>This type of statistical analysis is well capable of measuring pre-defined traits of a pre-factored population. It does nothing for discovering new and unaccounted-for traits and features in the population under examination; in fact, this kind of survey research actively militates against such discovery, because it is much easier to force data to conform to existing models than it is to realize that the data does not fit the model.<br/><br/>What this means in practice is that the correct way to use these sorts of tools is by developing them for the specific use case you have at hand. This involves much less a posteori insight than a layman may assume: you basically have to assume your conclusion to be able to create a tool that actually measures what you want it to measure. For example, were one to apply this kind of science to tabletop roleplaying, the first step would be to choose the actual model you want to gather data for - the survey method does nothing to make that choice for you, and if you choose wrong (that is, choose to measure traits that are not actually relevant to rpgs), you'll be measuring irrelevant rubbish. It is impossible to get the insight that "hey, something like a social value preference in gaming exists" from the survey method, because you have to first invent the idea of the "social value preference" to be able to look for that in your survey.<br/><br/>(In case somebody is wondering how one goes about developing the theoretical basis for useful statistical surveys in human sciences, the answer is pretty much case studies - you observe individual cases, pick them apart analytically, construct a theoretical model of what's going on, and then <i>that's</i> what you put through its paces in a statistical survey to see if it's actually modeling what you think it does.)<br/><br/><b>Triviality in application</b><br/><br/>Even if one did have a reasonably correct model of gaming motivations for tabletop roleplaying, backed up by data, it is very likely that the results of the study would be less incisive than one might hope for: either useless or trivially applicable.<br/><br/>Let's imagine that there is a gamer trait we call "hack'n'slash" in tabletop rpgs, which we are now successfully measuring in gamers (some have it, others don't), and which we have <i>successfully demonstrated to correlate with enjoyment of certain roleplaying games</i>. We call these games "hack'n'slash" games, of course, because the whole point of the edifice is to reliably pinpoint what a game must be like for the hack'n'slasher to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Once we're at this point it all depends on whether we actually understand what hack'n'slash is as a psychological mechanism: if we do, then it is relatively trivial to design that feature into the game. We could have done that without the study, in fact, as long as we were able to communicate to other people about our gaming preferences. If we don't understand what makes a game hack'n'slashy, then we will have difficulties applying the study: even if we know what we want - hack'n'slash - but don't know how to deliver it, then where does that leave us?<br/><br/>Furthermore, are we really applying this method at the statistically insignificant level of the individual gaming group? It is good to understand that at that point we're not doing anything very special anymore, science-wise: you're just asking your friends what kinds of games they like, and asking them to answer by a multiple-choice survey instead of telling you directly, so you can reduce the nuances in their desires into whatever theoretical model you're surveying for. The utility escapes me, <i>except</i> if you're operating with a specific model and have actionable plans for the results. For example, if you're choosing which game of options A and B you're going to play next - but if that's what you're doing, then why not just ask that, instead...<br/><br/>This difficulty in having demographic survey data translate into useful game design is not unique to roleplaying games by any means. Video game designers have the same experience of the data being simultaneously obscure and trivial: even if you know that 39% of the target audience prefers "social game experiences", this does not help you in any way in delivering that (or even knowing what the study means by that, really), and is only relevant if the game you're designing a priori works well to deliver that kind of experience. In general, the best utility you can get out of surveys like this is convincing others about there being an audience for your game; you can't design a game based on this stuff, not really.<br/><br/>(Personally I believe this application difficulty to be caused by a subtle misunderstanding of what game design and game play are as activities: practical attempts at applying motivation studies to design treat gameplay as essentially passive audience participation, and the motivation traits as something you "deliver" as the game designer. This approach has severe limitations due to the fact that people in the real world do not want e.g. "conflict" or "social interaction" as some sort of abstract good; they have very particular creative agendas that incorporate such goods in complex ways, not simple root motivations trivial to satisfy.)<br/><br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/><br/>I don't think that these surveys per se are useful for roleplayers, because they've been developed under some arbitrary theoretical assumptions that are not based on observing roleplayers; if they have applicability, it is by accident (or because the different types of gaming are fundamentally very similar).<br/><br/>The method used in these studies is useful for what it does, but I do not think that it produces useful insights for game design or, as Jonathan suggests, gamemastering for a particular group. It is best suited for examining the validity of the underlying theoretical model, or making discoveries about demographic shifts against a pre-defined model; both interesting concerns for science, but less so for practical gaming. Using these sorts of surveys against personality models to label individual people has little utility in my opinion; I've yet to see that produce anything actionable in any sphere of life.<br/><br/>If you want to look into this sort of thing further, though, I suggest starting with a motivation theory framework intended specifically for roleplaying. I think Robin Law's model is the most familiar to people, and it doesn't have any particular flaws, does it? One could conceivably take something like that and set up a generic survey to try to figure out what motivations an individual player brings to the table. I do not believe the resulting data to be very insightful, particularly compared to actually talking with the people involved, but it is something one could do. Maybe somebody already has a survey like this lying around?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462076/#Comment_462076" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-18T13:40:09+00:00" title="April 18, 2017  1:40PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I'm with you on this one.<br/><br/>Jonathan, thanks for sharing it.

It is no better than other motivation-models. No worse either, but that's no high praise in my eyes. Most significantly, it's about as good as they get - play substance motivation (or "core activity preference" as I like to call this kind of thing) is simply a pretty biased starting point for constructing a player typology.<br/><br/>Still, a much better starting point for a survey than just using a survey intended for e.g. boardgames. I don't know if that's what Jonathan had in mind, of course - are we talking simply using the existing video gamer surveys, or about developing one specifically for rpgs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462106/#Comment_462106" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-18T23:29:50+00:00" title="April 18, 2017 11:29PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unsurprisingly, I'm with Eero on this one. In short, establishing "player types" has two possible applications, as far as I can see:<br/><br/>* Deciding what content to include in your upcoming game, so as to "satisfy" the various interests of each player.<br/><br/>This probably has some limited merit, but, in my experience, isn't terribly useful. I'm really not fond of the whole "GM provides an experience for the players" philosophy of play, in any case; I think it breeds some really unenjoyable gaming for everyone.<br/><br/>In addition, thinking of "player types" doesn't create any or much room for people's shifting preferences. If I want to try playing a sneaky character this time, are you going to work against me, because a survey said I was "Butt Kicker"? No thanks.<br/><br/>* Deciding what game a group might enjoy playing.<br/><br/>We can survey our group and find that we are a good match for strategic boardgames! Great. Is that meaningfully superior to just asking what game we want to play next?<br/><br/>* Marketing or designing a game, trying to appeal to a certain demographic.<br/><br/>A more detailed or game-specific survey like this might have some application here. For instance, if I'm in charge of a D&amp;D product line, I might want to know that my customers REALLY like political intrigue. However, the categories in this particular survey seem much less useful than looking at the specific features of the game I'm trying to market or design; as Eero points out, they're not very actionable.<br/><br/>In short, the idea of "player types" has been done to death, but I have to see it bear any positive impact on someone's gaming. I take that as soft evidence that it's just not a productive direction to head in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462111/#Comment_462111" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-19T02:00:48+00:00" title="April 19, 2017  2:00AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No opinion on Robin's Laws, but yeah, I too am with Eero on the value of the surveys.

How it could be that, I have no idea, because even though I've tried to learn as much as I could about the historical context, I still can't <i>really</i> know how it <i>felt</i> back then. When I started learning about RPG theory (beyond what was in the books \u2014 the magazines that the books mentioned, I could never find) it was by lurking usenet through "deja news" read-only website and then by then it was already a post-<i>Everway</i> world and Strike Force had been out for many years.<br/><br/>By the time Robin's Law came around, though, I was there for it and it didn't help me. I guess the idea of the "casual player who doesn't want to engage just sit there and read comics" was something that was new to me, that I <i>thought</i> fit the description of a problem I had, but... it ended up being the wrong solution and it's sometimes better to engage the player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol" title="Jonathan Nicol"><img alt="Jonathan Nicol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol">Jonathan Nicol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462166/#Comment_462166" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T03:45:37+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  3:45AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2017 3:46AM by Jonathan Nicol.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mostly thought this was an interesting tool to get the conversation started about what your group enjoys, not as a monolithic thing.

I also think we should be trying to get at motives rather than behavior which is very culturally sensitive.<br/><br/>It's definitely not perfect, but I feel something like this hints at why I do not find most mainstream roleplaying games particularly immersive. I am interested in the fantasy of being my character and their deep expansive network of social ties, but kicking at the tires of the world (called Discovery here) holds absolutely no interest for me.<br/><br/>I also really like the separation of Mastery from Achievement. Meaningful decision making and real challenge are deeply important to me in all the games I play, but actually winning the day is of little interest.

I want to be able to have 100% in all or 0% in all, and not being labeled as being part of only one thing.</blockquote>\nMe too.<br/><br/>We talked a bit about <b>MBTI</b> the other day, you know the "INFJ" etc etc.<br/><br/>It's an early 20th century, pseudoscientific personality sorting test, with four poles. I vs E, N vs S, F vs T and P vs J. (What the letters stand for precisely isn't relevant to what I'm going to write here.) So someone might be designated an "INTP" if they're more I than E, more N than S, more T than F and more P than J, and there are sixteen such combos (as any four-digit-binary number would tell you).<br/><br/>By design, it's made to indicate with pole in a particular pair the person is <em>clearly</em>, not necessarily how <em>much</em> they're that thing. Ellen might be "clearly" E over I, but not particularly E, while Ingrid might be an E that's has more of I than Ellen has, but significantly more E than Ellen, so much so that I also is "clearly" E.<br/><br/>In other words, instead of  "You're 20% E and 10% I" and "You're 83% E and 40% I", it's "You are an E".<br/><br/>As a personality sorter, the categories are poorly chosen since because of a bell curve distribution, most people fall smack dab in the middle between the two poles in most categories. (An ideal sorter would instead be U-shaped, so that only a few people fell close to that middle line.)<br/><br/>Personally, the only letter I'm pretty sure of for my own part is the J. I have some P, too, but I'm consistently scoring J and recognizing myself in descriptions of the J personality type, for good and ill. Now, these tests are based on self-reporting so I might very well be kidding myself (though you'd think I'd rather want to be "perceiving" than "judging").<br/><br/>But I have very strong E traits and very strong I traits. I'm more E than many other E:s and more I than many other I:s. (That's not bragging --- I have struggled with some mental health issues and the MBTI is designed for a more typical population.) It's just that those extreme traits gets kind of cancelled out in the noise of the MBTI-system and I end up pretty close to the line between E and I.<br/><br/>So I agree with Rickard that having them as percentiles is useful for me too.<br/><br/>The same with <b>Rosewaters psychographics</b> that he and his team designed together for the Magic: the Gathering player base.<br/><br/>His perspective is that it's a prism-shaped space. A triangle with Tammy/Timmy, Jenny/Johnny, and Spike in the corners; these types are in opposition to each other and people can be mixes, can be placed anywhere on the triangle, but the corners inherently have different priorities. (If you remember the "treefold" from rgfa or are familiar with the Avon triangle of asexuality/bisexuality, you get the picture.) He then adds a completely orthogonal axis, the Mel vs Vorthos axis, turning the triangle into a prism. You can be anywhere on the triangle fully and completely, [i]and[/i] fall anywhere on the M v V axis, too.<br/><br/>(Tammy/Timmy: Emotional experiences. Jenny/Johnny: Mechanical self-expression. Spike: Skill testing. Mel: Values good game design for its own sake. Vorthos: Interested in the story and fluff behind the game world.)<br/><br/>I agree with his categories but I disagree with his geometrical sorting of them.<br/><br/>I'm very clearly a Mel when it comes to Magic. Thinking about the game in Mel terms is what gives me the most kicks. Seeing the interesting design solutions they come up with, like "Oh, yeah, putting those two abilities on the same card has this, that and that implications for play, wow, that's really cool". As the armchair/backseat designer I am.<br/><br/>But I see the five as more independent of each other than he does. My interest in the story waxes and wanes but it doesn't interfere with my Mel-ness. Same for the other three types, Jenny, Tammy and Spike. I definitely have Tammy-esque and Spike-like sides and when I started playing I was much more of a Jenny player.<br/><br/>Instead of the prism, I see it as a tesseract. You can be completely Mel, half Vorthos, completely Tammy, completely Spike and two thirds of the way to Jenny, for example.<br/><br/>Or, as Rickard, and Jonathans test, state it; percentages along various categories.<br/><br/>It's the "4d6 drop the lowest" theory of mind rather than the "Divide these points" theory of mind <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> You can have high strength <em>and</em> high dex.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462186/#Comment_462186" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T09:59:49+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  9:59AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2017 9:50AM by Upstart.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edited for dickishness] I'd like to emphasize the difference between RPGs and more competitive games.

It's funny, I also like competitive games because of their (implied) fiction, but I want the fiction to be produced by competitive play. If you have an explicit win condition in your game, cool things in the game should happen because the players are struggling to win.<br/><br/>Another major difference is that in RPGs, the fiction usually feeds back to the mechanics, while in boardgames, card games etc. this doesn't really happen, making fiction secondary to the play experience. Fiction-mechanics feedback loop doesn't work that well with explicit victory conditions, either, because people don't want to expliclitly lose to each other because of GM fiat. Is there any RPG that puts players, rather than characters, seriously against each other? I think the answer was "no" the last time this was asked.<br/><br/>I'm rambling, I know. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462287/#Comment_462287" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-21T14:27:58+00:00" title="April 21, 2017  2:27PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is there any RPG that puts players, rather than characters, seriously against each other?</blockquote>\nOh, most definitely!

We canceled our BE campaign after reading it \u2014 not that BE can't be good but because I realized we had the wrong approach to the game.</blockquote><a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/bewiki/index.php?title=Stranglehold" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the record of the BE game I played with <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>.<br/><br/>Although there are limits on Maneuver dice pools, there are several Maneuver rolls and every one counts and every die counts.  This doesn't mean it's possible to play every second of every scene in a hunt for these dice, but the degree of relevant pursuit is more than sufficient.  One of the challenges of play, IMO, is to maximize the dice you can get given the constraint of your tools, namely your characters.  My character doesn't know the Vaylen are invading, and that an alliance with Matt's character is key to stopping them -- he just knows he's at cross purposes with the Figures of Note.  I, as his player, do not have the option to just use him to fight the Vaylen with 100% efficiency.  I did what I could, writing beliefs that'd get me close, but that's a skill and some of us were better at it than others.\n<blockquote>Players throw up their hands in frustration at the fact there\u2019s a cap on the Maneuver roll. Players threaten mutiny when they don\u2019t see the narrative of the game impacting their Maneuver\u2019s outcome.</blockquote>To me, this sounds like a group who couldn't handle the fact that the roleplay and the pursuit of victory aren't synonymous at all times.  I mean, it's true, they aren't; but they do consistently impact each other.  Getting those 15 dice takes skill.  You do have to care about your character and their scenes for their own sakes in order to actually enjoy play, but I wouldn't be playing an RPG if I didn't want that.<br/><br/>Maybe if the players are <i>all</i> already <i>so good</i> at Burning games that maximizing their Maneuver pool is trivially easy, and also if they don't enjoy games where dice luck plays an important role, then the competitive aspect of the game could underwhelm.  But I dunno, I find most players are cool with this amount of luck, and there's a definite learning curve to the game's skill aspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462349/#Comment_462349" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-23T16:34:43+00:00" title="April 23, 2017  4:34PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thank you for this, David!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462350/#Comment_462350" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-23T16:41:01+00:00" title="April 23, 2017  4:41PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> knows the game better than I do.

For now I just wanted to say that I consider the video game based analysis more fruitful for discussion when considering role playing games. Most Core Gamer targeted games are games that are meaningfully about a somewhat dynamic fiction that exhibit many of the same pressures between optimal play and immersive play if not well designed, have a strong focus on the fantasy of being someone else someplace else, are often played cooperatively with a group where there is a level of cooperation and competition coexisting in the same space, and a good deal of personal identification with characters.

However, I'm struggling to see how GMvP could work without an external referee. Who is going to be evaluating the fiction to feed it back to mechanics? If it's the GM, he's going to screw the players. If it's the players, they're going to screw the GM. The fictional component will be there just to color the mechanics a bit. <br/><br/>Power Play practically screams character vs character Blood Opera to me.

The crunch is extremely simple and so are the interface points between the crunch and the fiction, and those interface points are all about benefitting the players, e.g. fiction triggering a roll on NFA to get +1 on future FA-rolls in a particular location.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462381/#Comment_462381" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-24T09:46:05+00:00" title="April 24, 2017  9:46AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's been a while since I played it.

We have social relationships to maintain after all. I also tend to enjoy games with more than 2 sides where part of playing the game is effectively engaging the social layer.
