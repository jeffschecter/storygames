You just have to know what it's <i>for</i>, is all. It has some usefulness in other arenas, like describing people or published systems, but I think its usefulness there is indeed more of a manifesto-ey usefulness.

(Oh, and while I did a lot of work documenting the Threefold, there were many contributors besides me to the ideas, especially Mary Kuhner who coined the term along with Jim Henley, Neelakantan Krishnaswami, and others.)  The Threefold Model also assumes that the modes of play are mutually exclusive in the sense that making a game more Dramatist will make it less Simulationist and/or Gamist.  It certainly did not think that you could get Dramatist games from systems designed for Gamism or Simulationism.  After all, the model arose after discussion of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theatrix</span>, which was a game designed to support Dramatism.  Around the period that the model arose (1998), we also got games like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Puppetland</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pantheon</span>.  In his original essay, Ron also cited Over the Edge, Prince Valiant, The Whispering Vault, and Everway.  <br><br>The original "System Does Matter" essay was primarily a re-phrasing of the Threefold Model with emphasis on game design rather than my FAQ's emphasis on actual play.  For example, the definition of Simulationist roughly matches the Threefold Model's, rather than the later definition where it was redefined to include genre emulation.  Narrativism was defined in terms of good story, like Dramatism, not in terms of Address of Premise.  <br><br>Still, the larger point is that I'd agree that "System Does Matter" was a successful manifesto.

It says that mixed goals is bad gaming.<br/><br/>This was clarified (more or less at the time of the original essays) to mean that you can't <i>prioritize</i> more than one goal.<br/><br/>In order for this to make any sense you have to posit some sort of baseline for prioritization, since it's obviously silly to claim that a Narrativist game doesn't partake of at least some of the elements of Sim or Gam. E.g., if you're going to claim that The Riddle of Steel is Nar, then you have to account for all the detailed combat &amp; world stuff. GNS claims that there's a hard distinction between the categories; you can't just say that Game X is more Sim than Game Y and leave it up to the observer to draw the line.<br/><br/>If GNS did that, it'd basically be back where the Threefold was, diagnosing incompatibility based on some kind of metric on the graph of playstyles. (As if it were a color wheel and Red is compatible with Mauve and even Orange and some of Yellow, but not with Lime Green. However Yellow <i>is</i> compatible with Lime Green. GNS doesn't work that way.)<br/><br/>The solution to claiming this hard distinction is to talk about reward cycles. But reward cycles aren't in the mechanics, or don't have to be; they're in how the players respond, socially, to whatever they enjoy in the game. Or maybe it's the content of what they enjoy. I'm not sure there.<br/><br/>Anyway, the reward cycles idea is logically sound: it says there's something qualitatively different between G, N, S play. They're not on a continuum.<br/><br/>Whether it matches up to reality is something I'm pretty dubious about. But that's the strong claim of GNS, what makes it a manifesto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69815/#Comment_69815" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T16:23:39+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  4:23PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>Iain, the manifesto portion of GNS is what Mike highlights: it claims that you can't mix goals.

More accurately (from my own understanding of the State of the Art) it is: "Mixed goals on this particular axis - the creative agenda - means that the group doesn't function as a coherent whole with respect to the exploration of the fictional content of the game. Functioning as a coherent whole in pursuit of a common reward produces better gaming." One of the things that's sorely neglected in the primal GNS essays (but is a lot better covered, although kinda obliquely, in the Infamous Five threads) is that there are at least two other dimensions of "good gaming" that also need attention - social context and technical context. And often they can be sufficiently important that their effects totally swamp the GNS-relevant stuff.<br/><br/>There's been this myopic tendency to look at GNS and totally blow right by the Infamous Five stuff about social and technical context - but then again, that stuff seems to provoke even <i>more</i> holy wars than the GNS stuff, so I guess I can see why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70130/#Comment_70130" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T06:03:22+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  6:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I can ramble later or I can ramble straight up front:  Up front it is!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's very convenient that human beings all see roughly the same visual spectrum, and all filter visual input in much the same way.  That way, when you are having a little walk through a garden, and you say "Hey, check out that red bush!  It's beautiful!" your friend will (hopefully) be able to look and appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine if I saw some things you saw, but I also (a) saw things you didn't see and (b) didn't see some things you did see.  I say "Check out that red bush!  It's beautiful!" and you're like "Bush?  What bush?  And what is this 'red' of which you speak?"  We wouldn't be communicating ... and if I spent a lot of time pointing out such bushes and looking for your approval, I'd probably feel unappreciated (and maybe feel that you were a dolt with no appreciation of beauty).  I might have a better time if I walked in the garden with people who saw roughly the same spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nGNS (to me) points out that people see different things in even the same act of roleplaying.  I clearly perceive some things in a game that other people do not pay attention to.  I'm wired differently than they are.  My eyes (to stick with the metaphor) do not see the exact same color spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is an insight well worth gaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that GNS goes critically wrong in focussing on what people <b>do</b> rather than what they <b>perceive</b>.  I do not agree that perception is the same as a goal.  I do not agree that one goal will crowd out any other type of goal.  I think that people wanted to prove that the theory is talking about something Really Real (not just the made-up notions of people with too much time on their hands), and so they denied the notion that they were talking about something that is Just In Our Heads.  That's throwing out the baby with the bathwater:  GNS talks about Really Real things that are Just In Our Heads.  It is a partial model of how we think and perceive, not a model of the interaction of the objective Gamist-Particles and Simulationist-Waves in gaming-space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play functional games all the time where we all are simultaneously aware of the-agenda-formerly-known-as-Gamist and t-a-f-k-a-Narrativist, and are pursuing the best way to weave a dynamic that strengthens and harmonizes all those elements.  <i>All.  The.  Time.</i>  I have been told on numerous occasions that this <i>cannot be true</i>, and that I therefore am wrong in the way I think about my own gaming.  Is that a "manifesto"?  I'm not sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70137/#Comment_70137" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T07:21:31+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  7:21AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you have the makings of some interesting observations there, Tony, but GNS clearly is what it is and says what it says.
