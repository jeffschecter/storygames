I went to this academic conference last February and found the audience very congenial. It's mainly English professors and grad students, applying various literary theories to the products of popular culture, but the folks who study video games are very cool, and many admit to playing or having once played tabletop RPGs. You'll notice that "tabletop game design &amp; theory" is an explicit category in the call for papers; that's the angle I got in on last time. I'm going to submit something for next year's meeting by the December deadline, and hopefully a few academic story-gamers will be there too. If anyone is interested in trying to submit a panel presentation -- indie gaming agonistes, perhaps? -- I'd be willing to try to pull it together.\n<blockquote>Please see this year's CFP (below). I hope you'll consider joining us in February for what always ends up being a incredibly fun and interesting time. Also, please feel free to pass this CFP along to any and all interested parties.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Judd Ruggill<br/>Arizona State University<br/><br/>_____<br/><br/>CFP: Games and Game Culture<br/>Computer Culture Area<br/>31st Annual SW/TX PCA/ACA Conference<br/>February 10-13, 2010<br/><br/>The Computer Culture Area of the SW/TX PCA/ACA welcomes paper, panel,<br/>and other proposals on any aspect of games or game culture.
