If you want something, you're rolling for what you want, not what you do.<br/><br/>The problem is that often, pausing to set up stakes or whatever method you use to get to conflict resolution can a) result in pre-play and b) more substantively, blow the fictional flow of the game, where you step out and have a conversation about out-of-character things, then go back into it.<br/><br/>So here's what I'm thinking as a system to deal with that.<br/><br/>Throughout your and others' scenes, you're taking notes and updating a limited list of goals. If your goal changes, you just write the newest version of the goal. These x goals (let's say 4) would need to be thematically tied in to the game in categories (for example, in a werewolf game, you might have a goal for prey, a goal for sex, a goal for self-control, goal for maintaining relationships, etc.).<br/><br/>When it comes time for conflict<sup>*</sup>, you've got these notes, maybe on 4 note cards, and when you have your crucial resolution moment (I'm thinking cards right now), you play the resources you have on the card you want. Therefore, you're making your goal clear without breaking flow.<br/><br/>Now if you have a bunch of little handwritten notes, it might be difficult to read and it might be hard to take notes and still pay attention to scenes. Instead, I'm thinking I might want to have these cards preprinted, with fill-in-bubble or -text-field choices, maybe at multiple levels. For example: Sex goal &gt; to have sex with someone &gt; Name. Maybe there are multiple choices on the "sex goals" card.<br/><br/>Of course, this subsystem isn't complete without figuring out resolution, the details of the goals more firmly, or a thematic notion to pin this to. But I think it's a strong idea.<br/><br/>What do you think of this system? How do you route around the flow-breaking tendencies of many conflict resolution games?<br/><br/><sup>*</sup> It occurs to me that it might be cool to have separate systems for conflicts you initiate, and conflicts that arise out of a "fuck no" situation in response to your actions, and a system for you to respond to both of these conditions from others.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290140/#Comment_290140" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T18:39:54+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  6:39PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of people would find that the cards pulled them out of the action more than taking about what they wanted... but it could work very well for others.

I am working on a design where the players not in scenes are deciding during play (w/o interrupting flow) what artifacts of play being created in scenes they are not present in are resources, how much they are worth (die size), and what kind of odds are associated with possessing them.  e.g.: Simone's Affection, Rhel's Loyalty, the Templar Mercs, the Brooklyn Church Geists.  It is really rough and I'm having trouble with it.<br/><br/>2)  I like the goals inherent in what you've shown and I love 3x5 cards for almost every game I play in.  People can grab them and turn them towards themselves as needed.<br/><br/>3)  Sometimes flow is really important to me and sometimes I really don't care if it's broken in the service of choices that make for the best stories and moments.  Fiasco and S/Lay w/Me are interesting recent favorites that have a form of resolution during that doesn't break flow (alternating narrative authority or free-form eye-contact +  group consensus) but then have a final resolution towards the end that breaks the "flow" just a bit only after most of the story is finished.<br/><br/>4) Whatever the final form, four is probably too many.  Three will probably be better.  The fourth goal is probably going to be weak sauce anyway and I think it's important to listen and stay engaged as much as possible during others' scenes.  My design requires active listening by players not in the scene.  You'll want to think about what it means for players who are making goals for their own characters during others' play.  Done poorly, it might might be another form of flow-breaking.<br/><br/>Great stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290152/#Comment_290152" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T18:56:47+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  6:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you willing to entertain the possibility of conflict resolution *without* explicit Goal/Stake setting at all?

One way is to do two things (1) scale conflicts down to the action level (not the same as a task) and (2) demand more description rather than explanation or justification.<br/><br/>"I pick him up by the lapels and slam him against the wall shouting in his face, 'Tell me where the girl is!'"  It's pretty clear what the intent is.<br/><br/>Even "I stare coldly in his eyes until he's quivering with fear." is pretty clear.<br/><br/>"I ram by elbow into him and flip him over so he lands prone on his back!"  Still pretty clear what the intent is.<br/><br/>Basically when the action itself includes the intended result you don't need to quibble about stakes.  The point is to understand that these declarations are *provisional* and pending the the actual result of the procedures and mechanics.<br/><br/>Some people are hung up on "If someone said it then it must have actually happened and there's nothing to be done about it."  So to prevent this people provide incomplete descriptions of their action, "I ram him with my elbow."  They feel like they need to know what the mechanical outcome is before they can complete the thought.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290187/#Comment_290187" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T19:45:48+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  7:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 7:46PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, I hate interpreting what people want, especially as a GM.

I was inspired by the moves in AW where you get to hold some points and then spend them during a conversation with someone in order to get them to do what you wanted or find out something about them that you wanted to know, such as "is he telling the truth?" I wondered if I could apply that to something more physical too, so I made up this mechanic with fudge dice, but you could totally change it around to use any sort of dice or card pool, where a certain result can represent a kind of currency for you to act, another result is currency for your opponent to act, and another is a currency to add some story element you can use later. You choose the type of move you're making, which defines what sorts of outcomes you can narrate, and then for every point you get, you can narrate the actual outcome. <br/><br/>So in this example, rolling 3 fudge dice for a fight move, every + is something you can do with the story elements that are already established, while every - you roll is something the MC can do with the same story elements. The blanks (represented as = here) are points either the player or the MC can use to establish a new story element, but they have to take turns with this -- you can't use a blank and a + one after the other, unless the opponent has no other resources to use. <br/><br/>The idea is that when you choose the move "fight," you set the stakes as anything a fight would normally encompass, and then you roll the dice the same way you would in D&amp;D, except that instead of saying "I attack... and I hit!" you state the general action, roll the dice, and then narrate the specifics, like this:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>PC: I attack... and....<br/>Fight roll 1: + = -<br/>PC: I slash with my sword, slashing at the goblin from above (+).<br/>MC: The goblin blocks it with his short sword, and grimaces at you (-).<br/>PC: I look behind the goblin and see an open door behind the goblin, maybe something I can push him into next time (=).<br/><br/>Fight roll 2: - - =<br/>PC: Oh no, um... Okay, I notice the room behind the door is filled with dangerous animals in cages (=).<br/>MC: Okay, the goblin takes a mighty swing and hits you for lots of damage. You're hurting now (- - both together, an attack and then extra damage).<br/>PC: I don't give up though! <br/><br/>Fight roll 3: - + +<br/>PC: Good, I attack the goblin again, with a hard swing to his left (+).<br/>MC: The goblin snickers and deflects the attack (-).<br/>PC: I kick the goblin and knock him into the room, where the animals and their roaring are a huge distraction for him (+ gives the player a bonus die on the next roll, like you have in Shadows of Yesterday).<br/><br/>Fight roll 4: + = -<br/>PC: I attack the goblin again with my sword while he's distracted (+).<br/>MC: Okay, you hit him (2 damage) and he's out. But as he's hit, he stumbles back and hits a cage door hard, grasping at it and pulling at the latch with his dying breath (= the MC can use this blank too. Now the PC doesn't have any other goods or blanks to use, so the MC goes again).<br/>MC: The strange dinosaur-like thing with talons and a sword like beak stirs, opens the cage door, and looks at you, ready to pounce. Now you're distracted! (- the player gets 1 penalty die on the next roll. Here the MC could theoretically do damage with the animal jumping out right away and attacking, but he prefers to strike some fear into his player first, and give him the choice of what to do. His job isn't about ripping the PC to shreds after all, but giving him interesting choices).<br/>PC: Yeouch! I'm in no shape to handle that. I'm out of here.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In a conflict about something else, you just choose the type of move you want to do, such as "argument" or "interrogation" or whatever, as specific or as general as you please. You can only narrate elements that pertain to this move, and only within certain parameters defined by the move, perhaps one attack per roll, one bonus, one extra damage, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It also forces the GM to work on description to make the players feel the dificulty. I have been working with as simple a die roll as possible to make it easier to determine the outcome.

There are things about it I don't like, but I do love it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Or more generally he who succeeds narrates.</blockquote>\nYeah, I can't really figure out why, but I find staking narration to be too dry. And I do like the fictive-directional-thrust of the goal cards system, where there are different categories of things the system says you must set goals for. I like how it requires that you keep attention on other players' scenes as they're playing.<br/><br/>See, goal cards might also address some problems I have with spotlight. Spotlight is mega-important to me. I desperately need to design to fix idiots, like me, who can't let go of spotlight. Besides, (gently<sup>*</sup>) forcing spotlight on people who don't think they're creative is a great way to show them that they're creative.<br/><br/>I like "party" style RPGs because it's easier for me to apportion spotlight that way. If everyone in the fiction is together, I know very well how to design to make sure no one's sitting around, bored. The problem with party RPGs is that keeping the party together can get contrived and annoying.<br/><br/>While many indie games address the contrived and annoying problem easily by splitting people off into their own scenes, I want something that will make sure that people are as consistently involved in other people's scenes as they are in their own. This is probably going to be impossible to do perfectly. <br/><br/>The system I've outlined above helps to address part of this. As you take notes (or fill in boxes and change a text field or three), the way the note-taking system is structured would (hopefully) keep your mind on things like what this means for the world, for your character, for important relationships, etc. For whatever the categories say the game cares about.<br/><br/><sup>*</sup> By "gently," I mean a) without being hostile or threatening and b) with creative constraint that is easy and fun and gamey and teaches you (without being didactic about it) that creativity is fueled by these constraints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290335/#Comment_290335" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T08:07:37+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  8:07AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>Oh, so you're saying that you might want to do something, and then find that none of the available moves fit it just right?</blockquote>\nNo, definitely not. Moves as written cannot possibly address the issue, because they're kind of the problem. Or rather, they're half the solution.<br/><br/>In Moves as written, there's no way to explicitly state what you want when you roll. I want to do that, and I want that to be preserved if you win, and to have your intent taken into account when you lose. I can't see a way to do that with Moves.<br/><br/>However, Moves are extremely good at preserving flow of fiction. I want to keep that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>Rob, when you played with the moves in AW, did the MC let you narrate your own success, or did he narrate it for you?</blockquote>\nI narrated my success. He narrated my failure. That's awesome. I love that. It's an economical way to let the GM not touch the randomizer, which is super cool. It allows me not to have to play a game against you. (I mean, <i><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a></i> already works this way, probably for that reason though I wasn't thinking of it at the time.)<br/><br/>However, if I MC narrating my your failure without knowing what you want, what you it is you're willing to risk, what you <i>intend</i> (this last is the most crucial one), I'm often going to wildly misjudge and have things happen that are out of proportion with your intent. I've seen this happen again and again in <i>Apocalypse World</i>, with different people MCing, so this isn't just theoretical. I'm also not saying it's an awful problem or I spend the game in a bitter funk from constantly being jerked around. But it happens more than I like, so I want to design around it.<br/><br/>Explicitly stating intent is the only way I see to do that.<br/><br/>I love the system you've outlined. It seems like a really cool way to do narrative combat. It doesn't quite address my concerns, though, because there's no way that I can see for those two players to be explicit about their intents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290336/#Comment_290336" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T08:07:51+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  8:07AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>This is a fucking interesting design constraint.

Newman</cite>Do you say, "I'm doing x so that y?" Is it a ritual phrase thing?

I'm not sure why I'm resistant to this as this solution.<br/><br/>Maybe I do? Is it because it feels like, "I slam him up against the wall and snarl, 'bladdy bladdy blah,'" then having a ritual phrase, relies heavily on placing that ritual phrase just right? If you do it at the start or the middle it feels like it would break flow. <br/><br/>For that matter, if you do it at the end, I can imagine someone in specific going, "Oh, um, aaaaaaannnnd..... I'm doing it because xyz." That feels flow-breaky too.<br/><br/>Maybe what I like about the goals cards thing (and stakes setting before a conflict, despite its flow-breaking) is that it means every side goes into the conflict with a goal and an intent in mind. You hold that mechanical/fictional idea inside you throughout the conflict and it gives steam to the conflict. In fact, I want ways to make sure you're constantly reminded by the system during the conflict what your drive is. The goal cards possibly address that as well, by having a concrete and easily-read expression of what you want right now sitting in front of you, and in front of everyone else too.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>A development of the system I mentioned earlier: there probably need to be goals in the form of relationships (Bonds? Ties? something werewolfy) between all significant characters (major protagonists or antagonists) in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290359/#Comment_290359" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T09:00:04+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  9:00AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might check out Smallville.

Is this just an illusion of high-level system mastery? Ritual phrases might <b>maybe</b> do this but...they're ritualistic, which to me is a rather out-of-fiction type of procedure. The players are playing the authors of the tale, not the characters within the tale.<br/><br/>* Maybe every call to action is naturally comprised of two things: what you want to do and how you want to do it (intent/task per BW, sort of). And maybe the system gives you a budget with which to determine how much of each half you "win". Example: I slam Ruglok to the ground (<i>how</i>) to show the clan that I'm in charge (<i>why</i>). You engage the system, and the system gives you enough currency to <i>either</i> take control of the <i>why</i> or the <i>how</i>, but not both. Or on a very strong success you get both. Whichever part you don't win passes to another player at the table -- i.e. the clan knows I'm in charge; Rob, how did that come to pass? Or vice versa! I've slammed Ruglok to the ground; Rob, how does the clan react to that? In both cases, the part you *don't* win becomes this new point of tension in the fiction, which can lead to new resolution opportunities. The player tasked with resolving the part you didn't win is encouraged to add a detail (<i>yes but</i> or <i>yes and</i> or whatever) that adds a new twist, thereby continuing the fiction.<br/><br/>Obviously super-duper rough idea. Hopefully the skeleton is clear enough.<br/><br/>Anyway, just something off the top of my head.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290385/#Comment_290385" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T09:58:41+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  9:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really don't want to argue about conflict vs. task resolution, but it's interesting to see that Vincent has the definition he has; I thought I was using a version of his explanation of the difference between conflict and task resolution.<br/><br/>Paul: Sure, I can go with those definitions for the purposes of this conversation.<br/><br/>I do X because Y might work.

Take the sentence I quoted above. Did that interrupt the flow of your paragraph? Why or why not? I'm guessing it felt natural to say "I want..." before you had actually achieved it right? Basically, were you not setting stakes for what you hope to achieve in this stage of your game design?<br/><br/>This kind of stakes-setting is actually quite natural and necessary in any kind of communication, if you want to be clear about what you're saying. I mean, in school, they teach us the first thing you do when you write an essay is to tell everyone what you're about to tell them, as a kind of introduction, to give them the expectations they need to know what they're about to read, then go through your supporting arguments step-by-step. Just like in roleplaying games, right? Say what you want, and then how you do it. <br/><br/>So what about stakes-setting breaks the flow for you? Is it the fact that we have to take the time away from narrating to establish the things we want to narrate? Or is it something about the way the stakes-setting is done? Does it take too much time? Is it too easy to get bogged down in the details of the stakes? Would it be okay if the stakes-setting was simple, fast, and part of language you'd use anyway?<br/><br/>I'm thinking of a sort of AW hack, where, at the beginning of a move, if it's not already obvious, a player has to state a simple clear goal, like "I want to look around here." The MC should ask, if it's not clear, about what the player's real intent is, "okay, but what do you want to find?" Suppose the player then says, "Oh I want find the secret entrance to the king's quarters and assassinate him," which is actually not one intent, but two narrative goals mashed together. So the MC can say, "Oh, well let's see if you can get inside first! Searching here should be Acting Under Fire, because the guards are on patrol," or whatever, and look at that move description for some suggestions about what the outcomes could be. On a full success, the PC finds it. On a partial success, he finds it, but there's a complication of some sort, inspired by the move (a "worse outcome"), but really determined by the situation (such as a magical alarm going off, giving him very limited time to complete his task before guards come). On a miss, the MC makes a move (which could be any number of things, possibly even finding a secret entrance to a guarded harem instead of the king's quarters). My hope here is that the simple statement of the "I want" sentence, plus minimal discussion or negotiation, would feel natural, all the stakes-setting this move requires, still well within the flow of the game. If flow is broken, it would be because of the lack of clarity in communication, not because of the rules. Once players know how to set the conflict "want" properly and quickly, it should be as natural as any time you say "I want," just like your sentence up above.<br/><br/>(My concern with your goal cards, by the way, is that I'm not sure goals can be so easily confined to a limited spectrum of printed options, even if there are spaces left blank. That was your problem with AW, right? Your actual intent isn't stated in the limited scope of the printed moves. I may use my "sex goal" card, when actually what I want is a relationship, not just sex, but no one would know unless I spoke it out loud, which would be back to the discussion thing you seem to want to avoid. Could the cards be designed in such a way that they can account for all possible intents, and at the same time differentiate similar goals?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290396/#Comment_290396" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T10:12:07+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 10:12AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I'm just saying, it's not a well-defined category, the edges are fuzzy.  Much of the time in RPGs, the intent is quite clear from the player's description of what the character is doing. "I punch him" means you want to damage him with your fists. That's your intent. A system that says you have a 50 percent chance of damaging someone with your fists is conflict resolution in that case.</blockquote>\nI think Jason is right to point out that we shouldn't talk about "conflict resolution" as if it's a done deal that everyone implicitly understands. There is a <i>lot</i> of subjective judgment that goes into identifying a "good conflict" in a lot of story games. In Jason's example, if the system gives each character some way of tracking damage then it's very easy for everyone to quickly agree that he's asking for damage in his conflict. If the system is really vague about valid things to ask for, then you can get into bizarre disconnects when different players' storytelling instincts don't line up perfectly "No, you don't just want to punch him, what do you <i>really</i> want?". A system that give obvious "synch points" for stakes makes it easier to make your intent obvious. If Rob's game tells the players that "character A has sex with character B" is a valid thing to have a conflict over, then it's easier for everyone to recognize that player X is fishing for a sex conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290397/#Comment_290397" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T10:13:17+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 10:13AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> solve this problem, Rob? <br/><br/>It basically lets you negotiate stakes after the role-playing instead of before, and that seems like a better place to break the flow. <br/><br/>For those of you who don't know IaWA, the system looks like task resolution until you succeed, and then you're negotiating with the player for stakes. If they won't accept your negotiated stakes, then you have some default consequences to fall back on.
