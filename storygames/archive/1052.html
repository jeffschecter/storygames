                    Hey all. I brought this idea up over at the Forge as well, but I was wondering what folks here think as well.<br/>
<br/>
What are your opinions ( and concerns about possible pitfalls) of submitting short rpg designs to non-rpg publicatiosn?<br/>
<br/>
Now mind you, I'm thinking about truly short rpg designs. Stuff like Shadows ( congrats Zak on the new creative commons liscense!).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried submitting them to magazines that might cover related topics/themes? I mean non-rpg publications. For example, submitting something like Shadows to a kids or parenting magazine?<br/>
<br/>
I've never heard of anyone trying it, but then I rarely hear of anyone trying to really break out of gaming/hobby-oriented markets with anything at all these days.                </div>

                            I reckon the "parlour" style games have a good chance of being accepted by magazines of that nature.                        </div>

                            I've thought about submitting a few of the individual tryant games from Heads of State to some literary journals that publish eclectic material. Sort of like a short story writer would try to get individual stories in print to build before trying to publish a collection as a book. I'm not sure if I'll actually try since that could slow down my plans to self publish the 9 games. I hadn't thought as much about submitting to a specialist mag related to the subject matter (political science, latin american fiction, post-soviet democratization, whatever - if they even exist). I think it's a good idea but maybe better for a shorter game if I finish other projects. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of pitfalls, you'd have to convince a journal that focuses on fiction or non fiction to consider a game; the more well known and higher circulation mag you submitted to the more competitive it gets; even if your game is accepted there can be a long lag time for some journals between acceptance and publication; the editors might require first publication rights so you couldn't self publish in the meantime; a game in a non-game mag might come off more as a gimmic than as something readers would get interested in actually playing; the time you spend submitting, dealing with edits, etc could get you less exposure and actual play than a similar investment in outreach to gamers, etc. <br/>
<br/>
But (if your psyche can handle getting rejected) these seem like minor points compared to the upside of reaching new audiences and helping spead the word of the innovations of rpgs/story games today. <br/>
<br/>
I'm going to start a spin off thread on the broader issue of breaking out of gaming markets, which is really interesting.                        </div>
