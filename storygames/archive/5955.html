This is a serious look at how the mechanics of Sorcerer touch the narrative.  Just what is the toolkit designed to DO?  Here\u2019s the answer as best as I can put it: The Sorcerer mechanics are designed to first establish non-obvious details of situation and then to transform that situation into an unexpected new situation.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s look at the core pieces one at a time.<br/><br/>The bonus dice at first look like GM bennies awarded for good player behaviors.  That is not the case.  In practice they operate a little more like fan mail in Primetime Adventures.  Basically bonus dice should be awarded for establishing details of the situation that in some way creatively stir the group.  Yes, the GM is the arbiter of this but if something makes a player go \u201cOooooooo\u201d or \u201cOh crap!\u201d it\u2019s worth a bonus die and if the GM fails to notice (as I personally am prone to do) then the players should say something.<br/><br/>Bonus dice are not about long winded narrations full of purple prose or sound and fury signifying nothing.  The things that usually earn bonus are stuff that actually establishes details of the situation that add nuance to the conflict at hand that was not immediately obvious.  Such nuances are often cool pieces of tactical and logistical texturing.  This is why they apply to the immediate role at hand are not stored up like Fan Mail because they are about refining the details of the here and now situation.  I\u2019m not just hitting you with a crowbar, I\u2019m holding it with both hands and thrusting it spear like into your chest.<br/><br/>These details are important because they make answering questions that may arise later easier to answer.  The clearer picture we have of what the character is actually doing the less confusing interpreting later rule applications become.  In some sense it narrows the acceptable narrative space.<br/><br/>Helper rolls as previously stated are about resolving larger chunks of ambiguous situation space.  Do I know anything about the demon?  Are there men loyal to me in the area?  Is my dragon style better than your chicken style?  The degree to which the answers these questions are useful are of course measured by the victories scored on the roll.<br/><br/>It should be noted if the answer to any of these questions are obvious from previously established fiction then no roll is needed.  For example it might have been stipulated early on that the character has never been to this area in his life.  Thus the question, \u201cAre there men loyal to me in the area?\u201d is pretty pointless.  The answer is an obvious, \u201cNo.\u201d  This applies to things the players may not know.  For example, it might be part of the GMs pre-play prep that the entire village is really a hallucination generated by a demon.  It\u2019s perfectly fine for the GM to just say, \u201cNo\u201d because he knows that the village isn\u2019t real.  But if judgment call is needed to answer the question then it should be decided by the dice rather than fiat.<br/><br/>Now here\u2019s the part where the creative context of the group matters.  Let\u2019s say I sequester myself for two hours reading the Necronomicon for two hours before performing a summoning ritual.  Is this a bonus die situation or is this a helper roll situation?  Frankly, it could be either and which it is depends on the groups\u2019 investment in this bit of description.  You kind of have to trust me when I say that in the context of play it is usually pretty obvious but I know that won\u2019t be satisfying to everyone so here\u2019s a guideline.  If the purpose of the description is just to show the character\u2019s process of summoning it\u2019s probably a bonus die.  If on the other hand, the purpose of the narration is to glean information that will then be applied in some manner to something else, then it\u2019s probably a helper roll.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133079/#Comment_133079" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T19:29:31+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  7:29PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 7:37PM by Jesse.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this point we have the details of the pre-roll situation.  From this point the mechanics are about transforming those in motion details into a new situation in a meaningful manner.  Any single die roll gives us two pieces of information the direction the narrative is going and the degree to which that direction matters.  In some sense Sorcerer die rolls are story vectors giving us a direction and a magnitude.  At this stage any ambiguities in the situation can often be resolved by comparing dice or applying victories.<br/><br/>Example of Comparing Dice<br/><br/>Imagine a situation in which two characters are wresting on the ground a third character wishes to strike down on the tussle.  The third character is clearly unconcerned with which of the two wrestlers actually gets struck.  Let\u2019s say that the striking character\u2019s action comes up first.  Which of the two wrestlers gets struck?<br/><br/>Here\u2019s one solution: Since everyone rolls at once we can compare the dice pools of the wrestlers.  Even though their actions have not happened yet we can see \u201cwho has the upper hand\u201d at the time the striking blow comes in.  That is the wrestler who gets struck because we can say with confidence that he is on top of the dog pile at the time of the strike.<br/><br/>Example of Applying Victories<br/><br/>Bob wants to shoot Carl.  Carl wants to pull Alice in front of him to use her as a shield.  We\u2019ll leave Alice\u2019s action out of it to keep it simple.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s say Carl comes up first and Alice fails to defend so she gets dragged in front of Carl.  The obvious application here is to take the victory dice from Carl\u2019s action against Alice and roll them over to his defense roll against Bob\u2019s shot.  Let\u2019s assume that Carl\u2019s defense roll is successful against Bob\u2019s shot.  But here\u2019s a perfectly obvious question with maybe a not so obvious solution: Does Alice get shot instead?  Do we have anything at out disposal that could answer this question for us so that we don\u2019t have to rely on fiat?<br/><br/>Yes, we do.  We have the victories from Carl\u2019s defense roll against Bob\u2019s shot of which Alice\u2019s role as human shield was a part of.  We can take those victories and immediately apply them as mid-round attack on Alice.  Notice that how Alice narrates her defense against getting shot herself could have a rather significant impact on the situation.  If Alice says something like, \u201cI throw myself to the ground dragging Carl with me if I have to\u201d and she succeeds in defending against the bullet it might very well be the case that Carl is now prone on the ground, a situational transformation that wasn\u2019t even part of the apparent possible outcomes at the top of the situation.<br/><br/>Some of you might be asking where in the rule book this miraculous application of mechanics is listed: A secondary mid-round attack?  Where is THAT listed?  It isn\u2019t.  It isn\u2019t because this isn\u2019t a separate rule.  Nor is it something I just made up.  It\u2019s an example of the application of currency.  And that is the artistry of playing Sorcerer: learning to use the currency to resolve ambiguities in the situation without falling back on fiat.  That is what takes practice.<br/><br/>Even more so there may be more than one way to legally resolve that ambiguity and which of the options is more appropriate depends entirely on the greater creative context of the narrative.  I alluded to such a situation in my post about conflicts with inanimate objects.  Consider the gun lying on the ground that a player wants to pick up.  When that action comes up does he just pick it up unhindered his with roll effectively only establishing when the action happens relative to the rest of the situation OR does the gun in some way oppose his attempt?  The question relies entirely on the greater creative context of the narrative.  Again, I can only say that it\u2019s usually fairly obvious in play but I\u2019ll offer up another guideline.  Where is the groups\u2019 investment in the gun?  Is what\u2019s at stake in the greater narrative just whose hands the gun ends up in?  Or is it more like the opening scene of Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom where we\u2019re interested in watching the gun run around a bit like the diamond?<br/><br/>Now let me touch on one more aspect of the system that I haven't previously dealt with: Total Victory. We\u2019re back to adding depth and detail to the situation.  By design Total Victory has no mechanical effect.  Instead it allows a player to add another level of situational detail to the outcome of a conflict.  If the character was swinging a crowbar at the enemy\u2019s head and score total victory did he break his jaw or gouge his eye out?  Again, it\u2019s about narrowing down that narrative space with more detail that will seriously inform follow up narration and rules applications.<br/><br/>I have no idea if I\u2019d made things clearer or more confusing but this is my best shot at explaining how the rules and the narrative interact.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133086/#Comment_133086" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T20:45:27+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  8:45PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted to the Forge stumbling toward a similar understanding about In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/>"The narrations are chained together by the context and logic of described events.

It's about call and response among an ALREADY creatively synergistic group.  Sorcerer wasn't designed with the idea that total strangers would play together.<br/><br/>If it helps, the GM very much has a leadership role, which is different from "control."  For example, Sorcerer strongly recommends that the GM comes to the group with a strong aesthetic vision that the other players buy into, such as the outlines for my Gothic Fantasy setting I carry around with me.  This is analogous to someone saying, "I'm starting a Rock 'n' Roll band."<br/><br/>If someone suddenly busts out The Blues in the middle of my Rock 'n' Roll band, it's an obvious and easily corrected social blunder.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133280/#Comment_133280" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T12:33:01+00:00" title="March  7, 2008 12:33PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suddenly wonder whether the playing in a band metaphor makes sense to people who have never played in a band?

That's what this very thread was about.  Showing how each of the individual pieces narrows down the legitimate creative choices.  You've got key, tempo, maybe even a basic riff, the roles of the actual instruments themselves but at some point someone's got to dive in and make music.  <br/><br/>2) A band is not a board room meeting.  In a board room meeting although there's a group agenda often personal agendas confound that, such as wanting to cover your own ass and shift blame and responsibility away from yourself.  That might happen to a band as a commercial entity but it usually doesn't happen in an actual instance of music making if everyone is really committed to the music.<br/><br/>3) It isn't perfect.  Yeah, sometimes someone calls, "Hold it!  Hold it!  And turns to the bassist and says, dude, what's with the Ray Charles act?  Could we maybe have a little more Clapton?"<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133309/#Comment_133309" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T13:38:38+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  1:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this point the metaphor is obscuring the point rather than helping it for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133310/#Comment_133310" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T13:40:32+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  1:40PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your group already has a strong and creative (and co-operative) agenda, what do you add by having dice to guide your creativity? I am sensing that it is *not* random change, or neutral arbiter, or the other things dice are usually good for, so what is it?<br/><br/>And I'm confused by the hatred of fiat. In a strong creative co-operative group fiat is not a bad thing. Why does a random dice roll have a  better perspective on who has an advantage, and how much of an advantage, than intelligent humans? <br/><br/>Of course I know the answer in *general* : people are often idiots, player interests get conflated with character ones and go at odds with each other and so on. Most games have dice (and GMs) to arbitrate where such conflicts and idiocy appear, but when your group is already in marvelous synch, why do you need them? If all you are doing is adjuducating the edge cases where advantage is not obvious then Amber's "highest score wins" does fine, so why the dice and currency here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133314/#Comment_133314" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T13:47:53+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  1:47PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 1:48PM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey David, quickly, I have no problem at all with fiat.

Come on!  How about "I think we should focus our resources in Endeavor X, and you think we should focus our resources on Endeavor Y?"

I wish I had a better metaphor to pull out of a hat, but I really haven't. One thing, though, playing improvisational music in a band is not about "consensus" as I understand the term which is "some kind of agreement". If you and your fellow musicians are trying to come to some kind of agreement, it's not going to work. You HAVE to go out on a creative limp, put your own creative power at risk. Yes, you have the chord structure of the song, you perhaps have the melodi and some kind of premade agreement on how many verses, choruses, breaks, bridge, and suddenly: OK, you solo! AH!<br/><br/>When something works in music, we call it "the groove" or "it grooves". That's something you feel. There's no way to re-create that groove by playing something exactly the same way as you did when it grooved the last time. But you can record the sesssion and play it back, and if it grooved originally it will still groove whe you listen to it. It's almost impossible to groove with yourself playing all the instruments - listen to a Prince studio recording and then listen to the same song with Sheila E on drums - different worlds.<br/><br/>The jazz trompet player/band leader/composer (and painter) Miles Davis explored this "landscape" extensively in his entire career from the 1940s until his death in 1991. He developed an interestingly technique to stress his band members to perform their best (most creatively). Let me try to explain, if you are still reading at this point <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>When faced with this challenge of soloing for example, in a band, musicians of course use a number of tricks and techniques, just like we do as roleplayers. Musicians practice their skills, they test ideas beforehand, often on their own or when practising, so when they have to perform for real in front of an audience they have something to fall back on. But then, when a solo that should be improvised or original comprises only rehearsed licks and ideas, then it can be a bit, well, bland perhaps. Eddie van Halen kicks out some astonishing short 8-bar solos, fx, but they are rehearsed down to the smallest detail. Great craftmanship and skill, but maybe a bit bland creatively.<br/><br/>Miles Davis solved this in a very straightforward way. He would simply let the musician in the spotlight (the soloist) play himself dry, let him use every single old idea and stored snippet the guy could dig out of his arsenal. And then he would place himself in front of the now stressed musician only waiting for the signal for the solo to be over and urge him to continue. Play on. An magic stuff happened.<br/><br/>Apologies for the babbling <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> and EDIT: crossposted with lots of people <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133330/#Comment_133330" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T14:31:48+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  2:31PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 2:36PM by Jesse.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite><br/>Okay, give me an example of something that you can do or say in a<em>Sorcerer</em>game that narrows down my legitimate creative choices.  Please.</blockquote>\nWithout a greater play context this question is almost impossible to address but I can try.  Let's stick with the man in the woman in the bar because I like the example.<br/><br/>Let me clear that the first roll does not accomplish *nothing*.  As the player of the woman it gives me a really vital piece of information.  The man walks up all flirtation and friendly.  The die roll tells me if the woman is moved by this at all.  It does not constrain her BEHAVIOR as chosen by me but it does give me a new piece of information: is she or isn't she receptive to this guy at all.  I HAVE to take that creatively into account but it's my call on HOW I creatively take that into account.  If I just ignore it all together, I'm an asshole and not a socially functional participant.<br/><br/>So, creatively I have two pieces of information.  I know she likes the guy (as per the outcome of the roll) and I know she's terrified of her boyfriend.  I decide that she's scared of this guy.  He got past her emotional defenses.  She's got to get away before she gets herself or this nice guy in trouble with her boyfriend I have her run away.<br/><br/>Contrast that with what happens if the roll failed.  She's totally unmoved by this guy AND she's afraid of her boyfriend.  So I might STILL have her run away but before it was colored with desperation, and now it's more of a "fuck, you jerk" move.<br/><br/>And that might be sustained through several sub-situation.  For example consider the point where she tries to call the bouncer over.  Let's say the guy's victory dice give out and she actually succeeds in getting the bouncer involved.  The outcome of that FIRST die roll is still in play.  To me that's the difference between a, "Hey don't hurt him Joe, just get him out of here." vs. "I hope you tear his arms off Joe." moment.  Hell if the PC starts getting violent with the bouncer, that initial success might be the difference between her stepping in to prevent it and sitting back and letting the fight ensue.<br/><br/>But it's true that there's no way for you the player to ENFORCE that on me.  If I'm not taking it into account at all I'm being an asshole and not really playing the game.  But it's still my creative call on HOW I take it into account.  And in terms of rules or no rules, I'd really rather have that piece of information than not have that piece of information.  Because at the top of the scene I'm squirming uncomfortably because ALL I have is her fear.  I have no way to judge whether she is turned on or off by the guy's flirting.  When such situations arise it is genuinely emotionally uncomfortable situation for me.  But I either make that call in a vacuum or I turn to the dice which convert my unease into something useful.<br/><br/>Now I'm not a perfect person.  I make bad creative decisions from time to time and I forget things from time to time.  The rules are no substitute for genuine communication.  I have had games where someone has said to me something like, "Dude, she's being kind of hostile.  Did my initial flirting success mean so little?"  And as a socially and creative receptive person my response is usually either, "Oh crap!  I forgot about that!  Sorry, forget what I just said, this happens instead...." OR "No, I haven't forgotten.  I'm getting to something trust me..."<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133341/#Comment_133341" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:19:27+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 3:19PM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay... trying to fit my head around this.<br/><br/>Cause right now, it seems like this isn't a resolution system at all.

All you can do is kill them if they resist enough. Same goes for Sorcerer. Especially considering that all those roll-over victories that you've been husbanding can be pushed into a combat roll at some point if killing is how far you're willing to go.<br/><br/>The difference you're seeing is that in Wicked, you can incrementally hurt someone, through Injury or Exhaustion. Which puts them at a mechanical disadvantage if they choose to resist you some more. Which, I would argue, is the same as having a 9:4 dice mismatch in Sorcerer due to roll over Victories. You're in a weaker position going forward and have to decide how much it's worth it to you. The combat and killing mechanic is right at hand, and we might engage it at any time now when things are not gonna go your way.<br/><br/>Does that shed any light here?<br/><br/>(cross-posted with David)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133353/#Comment_133353" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:39:41+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:39PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 3:40PM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper (emphasis mine)</cite><br/>In the Wicked Age, you can't make anyone give you what you want, either.

They don't even have to roll over to your OWN roll.<br/><br/>That's totally how you mix and match social and physical conflict.<br/><br/>Bob wants to shoot Carl.  Alice pleads with Bob not to shoot Carl.<br/><br/>Alice goes first Bob chooses not to abort and defends with just one die.  He looses but, again, isn't bound to any course of action, so chooses to shoot Carl anyway.  Carl then gets ALL of Alice's victories over Bob as bonus on his defense dice as Alice clearly distracted or moved Bob in SOME hesitating manner.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133361/#Comment_133361" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:46:31+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>So each successive attempt by the target to resist has a fair chance of using up those bonus dice on failures and depleting your advantage.</blockquote>\nThat is my understanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133363/#Comment_133363" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:48:07+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, David, you have it right.

We can use the dice over and over again in the same father-daughter spat, and if the stick gets used three times on anybody, they're out of the game.

But, since the system is engaged in a specific situation, with specific actions taken by the characters, you're not assigning meaning out of the blue. You don't say she's intimidated or drunk without that being established as part of play.<br/><br/>And "has the advantage" is a mechanical thing, but the fictional <i>consequences</i> of the roll are the resolution. That's why we're not just doing pass/fail task stuff here.<br/><br/>The initial roll (the man flirting) is very significant. It provides resolution, and may even be the only roll we make. We don't have to drive to complete, final (or deadly) results in order to get meaning from the resolution system.<br/><br/>"She seems like she's into you, but suddenly pays her check and leaves," is totally conflict resolution. The status quo has changed. Whatever happens next isn't just a do-over or attempting the same task again. What do you really want out of this? becomes a question that drives play in a big way.<br/><br/>Like, "But what I wanted was for her to sleep with me!" Okay. You won the initial roll when you flirted with her. She thinks you're cute. But she is a person with her own mind and goals. She doesn't want to sleep with you. Or, at least, not right now from this interaction at a bar. Now what? Do you want her to sleep with you so badly that you will force the issue? Cajole, dominate, control, threaten or whatever it takes? The system will push us further and further to find out. But, absent the threat of force on some level, there's no mind control. No guaranteed outcome to win with a die roll.<br/><br/>Instead: Action -&gt; Result -&gt; Consequences. New Action -&gt; Result -&gt; Consequences... and so on.<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: And, to move away from the force issue, those victories you won on the flirting contact can certainly be kept for some future scene in which you see her another time and try to make a further connection, in a more normal dating way rather than the immediate conquest thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133398/#Comment_133398" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T17:09:27+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  5:09PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh,<br/><br/>Intent matters.

Because that's the ultimate recourse of any culture - I continue to contend that the degree to which a culture is "civilized" and the degree to which the threat of death is removed from daily life are strongly correlated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133405/#Comment_133405" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T17:38:21+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  5:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intent as it is used here and in Sorcerer operates on the scale of force of action.  Which is not the same as task, we're just talking about small scale conflicts.  That leaves the Uber-Agenda (generally the realm of Stakes) a) mailable and b) often unarticulated.<br/><br/>For example you might go into the scene intending to get the woman to go home with you (that would be the Stakes in PtA or Dogs) and towards that agenda you open with flirtation with the intent to endear her to you.  But as soon as the stuff about the boyfriend comes out you might very well abandon that original idea of trying to get her to sleep with you and move to something else.  Again this often happens silently.<br/><br/>As the situation moves from conflict-to-conflict within a situation what would normally be the Stakes in PtA or Dogs is likely to change rapidly.<br/><br/>This is usually clearer in a fight scene.  The mechanics will only resolve the individual physical clashes but the fight is generally *ABOUT* something else (that would be the Stakes in PtA or Dogs) and that thing can often change a few times over the course of a fight (unlike in Dogs or PtA).  More importantly the narrative details of those physical clashes often reflect what the fight is about and signal when that something has changed.<br/><br/>I don't 100% see it as just an issue of scale, but it is 95% functional to think of it in those terms.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133407/#Comment_133407" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T17:55:22+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  5:55PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 6:08PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intent: I want her to be attracted to me.

After the race that I won, when Joe and I both try to get our classmates to vote for us for class President, I have bonus dice in my roll and Joe doesn't. Did I <i>actually look cooler</i>? Depends on how things go down in the fiction, how people respond -- but we know for sure that I carry an advantage away from our foot race, and that is reflected in the fiction based on how my bonus dice help out (or not).<br/><br/>We resolve the small-scale conflicts which change the situation and lead to different future conflicts where someone might carry an advantage. Do we ever ultimately decide, once and for all, if I'm cooler than Joe? Maybe. But the dice don't tell us all at once. It's over time, over a series of fictional events (affected by dice outcomes) that we might come to a judgment as s group and choose to stop pursuing it via conflicts and dice results.<br/><br/>Going back once again to Wicked: I want to be the hero of the village! Okay, that's your goal or intention here, but do you turn out to be the hero after all? We don't know after the dice hit the table. We only know after many interactions, where advantages are won and lost, and the cumulative fiction (affected by dice outcomes) lets us make a judgment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133408/#Comment_133408" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T17:58:54+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  5:58PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 6:00PM by Jesse.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I have to disagree with you.
