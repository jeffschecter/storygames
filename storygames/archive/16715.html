Does anyone have good advice, or links to threads about running dungeon crawls for large parties? And as a secondary, what constitutes a good adventure for a big mob of zero-level characters?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382221/#Comment_382221" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-13T16:11:47+00:00" title="June 13, 2012  4:11PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2012 4:14PM by nemomeme.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since character creation <i>is</i> quick you might be tempted to do it all at the table.  I don't think I would.  There are quite a few tables to reference with weird dice (d24, d30) so making 21 characters for, say, 7 players, might take longer than you'd like.  I'd recommend rolling up a bunch of templates beforehand and passing them out randomly.  Write down what the Birth Augur does with more detail if needed.  Maybe leave just Name, Alignment and Ability scores blank if you want to retain the "roll 3d6 in order" fun of character creation.  <br/><br/>I've been through an 18 character funnel and a 12 character funnel.  I'll be going through another 18 character funnel before GPNW.  Having that many characters can be hectic for sure.  Minis for a marching order will be a must.  I recommend a rotating caller who is also the same person who touches the marching order minis.  People can override the caller but otherwise you've mostly got one person at a time calling the mini placement shots.  Since the corridors are crowded and everyone pretty much has 1-4 hitpoints, where your mini is at any given time is important.<br/><br/>One thing that constitutes a good adventure for a big mob of zero-level characters is threats that come from the front, back and middle in equal proportions.  Being the first gal into the room shouldn't be the suicidal choice every time.  Sometimes going into the scary room should be the safest place to be.<br/><br/>A potential \xdcbermensch of a 1st level character got portcullis'd to death in the last funnel by being the last guy in the marching order and not getting out of the way in time.<br/><br/>Most of the weapons the characters start with are pretty bad; finding some armor or an actual shortbow, sling, or longsword feels like a nice treasure that might give you a fighting chance out of the hellhole you're in.  Of course, when there are 18 of you, who actually gets to wear/wield it?  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382224/#Comment_382224" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-13T16:23:22+00:00" title="June 13, 2012  4:23PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run Tomb of the Iron God for a pretty big group, and it worked well. It has straightforward and sparse descriptions which don't need too much attention, but there's enough going on in the dungeon that it's not a simple monster motel. It rewards some thinkinf and planning as well as the kind of rolling maul that big parties can become. And it has monsters which can attack from all sides.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382229/#Comment_382229" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-13T16:50:42+00:00" title="June 13, 2012  4:50PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't be afraid to split the party.

High kill count is desirable.  Get two assistants - one to explain the rules to people as they show up, the other to hand out half-way filled in character cards and help people fill them in.  When you die, you go back to the assistants, thus keeping the mumber of people you interface with down.  Put the castle map (micro dungeon) on the back of the character cards - now they are character sheets, maps, souvineers, and business cards/flyers for your work all in one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
