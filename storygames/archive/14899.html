The game was as emotional as any movie I have ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was NOT a perfect storm of elements coming together to create a rare experience. My friends have played several games with this GM where multiple people cried repeatedly. The experience was crafted (part GM skill, part game design), not random.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe used a combination of GM and game design techniques to achieve this. Many of which I would have never expected to be so emotional. The game was like jeepform\u2026 but less intense (which made it more emotional). For example, one technique he used was boredom! There were long stretches of the game that were "boring" from a modern movie perspective. Some of his techniques are detailed in Graham's new book, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thievesoftime.com/news/front-page/stealing-cthulhu/" rel="nofollow">Stealing Cthulhu</a>. The game was a perfect execution of page 38.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have a lot of time right now to go into details but I will later.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, <b>have you ever played a game where you or another player cried*? </b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What caused this reaction? </b><br/>\n<br/>\nAs a complete aside, I feel really lucky. I've had the privilege and fortune to game with hundreds of different people all over the world, many with completely different styles, many out of my initial comfort zone, and I've learned  a lot. I work as a creative director professionally and it's definitely improved my craft.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Cry in a good way. There are dysfunctional ways to make someone cry in a game. That's not what I'm talking about. I mean the kind of crying where someone watching a movie is so emotionally engaged in what's happening that they get caught up in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338596/#Comment_338596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T11:43:10+00:00" title="August 13, 2011 11:43AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 9:06PM by jenskot.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EDIT: </b>The GM who ran our game has asked me to rescind the rule to keep his name anonymous.

Sometimes that makes for stories that echo hard experiences we've had. (2) There's lots of moments of "boring," just like the game that Jenskot's OP describes. Having lulls in the action allow you to just connect with your character, and hear their thoughts. (3) The game is very immersive, and the mechanics are very light and require very little handling time. There's nothing mediating conversations. (4) The game isn't about succeeding at a task; it's about exploring an outlook. When you aren't getting swept away by the success/failure paradigm, you have more energy to put towards empathizing and resonanting.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338637/#Comment_338637" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T17:00:03+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  5:00PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2011 5:37PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did the GM cry?

Don't read further if you want to get the full experience in person.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\n<b>GAME MECHANIC DETAILS: </b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe game was a hack of Unknown Armies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSucceed at tasks if you roll 2d10 percentage dice under a stat or skill. Stats ranged from 40-60%. Skills were 30% or less. If you roll, you will most likely lose. This fact was emphasized. You can tap your traits (Obsession, Rage Stimulus, Fear Stimulus, Noble Stimulus) a limited number of times to manipulate the dice to increase your chance of success. But the more stress you overcome, the more hardened you become, the less emotional you become, the less you can tap your traits to help you. In play, we rarely roll skills till the very end of the game. But we frequently, unrelentlessly, almost immediately roll against stress. Our characters started the game with hardened and failed boxes checked off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen faced with stress, you roll 2d10 under your Mind stat. On average you have a 50% chance of success but you roll frequently (I rolled stress 11 to 13 times). When a stress roll is called, it is against 1 of 5 categories of stress: Violence, Unnatural, Helplessness, Isolation, and Self. And each stress test has a severity associated with it rated from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). When you succeed a stress roll, you mark 1 of the 10 Hardness boxes next to that specific category of stress (say Helplessness). You are then in control of your character to act as you wish. The more hardened you become, they less you are able to use your traits but the less stressed you become when faced with the same source of stress. For example, if you are asked to make say a stress roll against Violence, severity 2 but you have 2 boxes of Hardness checked next to Violence\u2026 you don't have to make the test! Failing a stress roll is when the craziness begins\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nFailing stress rolls greatly differs from the default Unknown Armies rules. If you fail 5 stress rolls in any category, you become broken. This never happened so I don't know the specific consequences of reaching this state but it was always a threat since the GM can ask you to make stress roll after stress roll in succession, you usually have a 50% chance, and there is very little you can do to improve your odds of success. You are never safe! But the effects of failing a single stress roll was unlike what I've experience in most other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailing a stress roll means losing control of your character. You choose 3 options: fight, flee, or freeze. You have 3 seconds to choose one or the GM chooses. Then the GM tells you what happens. If you choose fight, the GM could say you snap, try to punch a police person, and then when you snap out of it you are in jail. If you choose flee, the GM could say you run into oncoming traffic. If you choose freeze\u2026 you don't stand in place, instead your mind shuts down and the GM can do anything they want. And to be very clear, in most cases, when you failed a roll, you were plunged into the worst possible situations imaginable. The GM tells you what you do, and the results of your action. If you choose fight, the GM says who you fight, if you win or lose, describes the immediate consequences, and hands you back control of your character at the worst possible time. You often are in a situation where you are apologizing for something your character did, but it is also something you as a player did not do. And nothing was held back!<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\n<b>SOCIAL CONTRACT: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>NOTE: </b> The GM was intelligent, kind, usually soft spoken, often complementary, patient but strict. When he makes statements, he doesn't ask for approval or consensus. This is ultimately his game. He clearly without hesitation states in a parental / authoritative way what he wants and doesn't want. Many of the players later commented that the GM at times felt like their father was speaking to them (even before the GM played their character's fathers in the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nLoosely paraphrasing the GM's introduction:<br/>\n<br/>\n"This is not a game, this is a movie. A movie like The Ring, The Others, or The Exorcist. I like to run what I call, Twilight Zone adventures. I am the director of this movie, you are the actors in this movie. I pay for this movie and film is expensive. In fact, I pay for it inch by inch so I will be very strict about cutting scenes, saying when and where scenes start, and keeping everything moving."<br/>\n<br/>\n"There are times that I will hand the director chair over to you. When you are the director, you say what happens. Don't ask me if there is a window behind you. If you say there is, then I paid for someone in my prop department to put a window there. You are in control. Describe everything from the perspective of what the audience sees. Tell us what the camera sees, how the camera moves. Tell us where and when we are. Tell us who is there. Tell us what everyone is doing (he made it clear later that we could even tell other players what their characters were doing when it was our scene, although very few people felt comfortable doing this). But sometimes, because film is expensive, I will tell you when the scene cuts and when we need to move on. If you say something that is untrue (I can't remember the example, but say you said World War 2 ended in 1949 instead of 1945), for all intents and purposes it is true in our movie. Just do not contradict something we have already established and do not break the movie's tone. And be mindful of the people around us, we are not alone in this room. You may say awful things but if for example, you see a child in the room, censor yourself as needed."<br/>\n<br/>\n"You don't have to always speak in character but always describe what the audience sees. I will not tolerate making this movie into a joke. And I will not tolerate breaking the tone of the movie. Do not make inside jokes or turn this movie into a parody of other movies. There will not be any explicit sex in this movie on camera but sex can happen behind closed doors outside of what the camera and the audience sees. If you need to use your phone, to talk or text, you may, but do not do it at this table. But feel free to leave the room and come back when you are ready. There will not be any specific bathroom breaks, if you need to go to the bathroom or go get water, feel free to go at any time (and then he gave us very clear, very friendly instructions about where the bathroom and water fountains are)."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Keep the details of your character handout secret but we all see what the camera sees. If someone reveals a secret that the audience sees but our characters don't have any knowledge of, you may ask the person who revealed the secret if there is anyway your character can find out what happened."<br/>\n<br/>\n"I should warn you, I've run this game 13 times now and in 10 of the games at least 1 person, often multiple people cried. This movie deals with sensitive material that often cuts very close to home for many people."<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough there was a warning about many things, there wasn't a discussion about racism, sexism, abuse, different kinds of violence, or any other content that someone might object to or feel uncomfortable with in the game. The GM never said it, but it seemed implicit that he would push us but not too far and some of these uncomfortable topics were used explicitly to make the game feel more "real". He also gave off the feeling, "you can trust me." But there was at least 2 scenes where a few of us were worried, "are we really going there" (I'm not going to go into more detail than that) but the GM never went too far. It felt like Jeepform in this way. Everything about the game actually screamed Jeepform to me.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\n<b>more below... </b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338704/#Comment_338704" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T08:24:36+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  8:24AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>WARNING: </b><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you plan to play Unknown Armies at Gen Con or Origins\u2026 this may be considered spoilers. Don't read further if you want to get the full experience in person.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\n<b>CHARACTERS: </b><br/>\n<br/>\nEvery player had a pre-generated character with a handout filled with backstory written from the character's perspective. The writing was excellent. Every character had their unique voice, concerns, and perspective. The handouts detailed how we're connected to everyone else in just enough detail. Every character had clear motivations, fears, and reasons for those motivations and fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery player hand a giant standing tent card that had our character's picture, name, and outwardly obvious traits written on them on both sides of the card so everyone could see who everyone was playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had smaller tent cards for "fight, flee, freeze" that we could place on top of our character tent cards when we failed a stress roll so everyone knows who was stressing out and how.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were playing teenagers, all in high school, all living with their parents.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\n<b>GAME PLAY: </b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM was soft spoken most of the time in a way that made you lean forward to listen closely to what he was saying. But he would grow very loud when it was appropriate and the contrast was at times startling in a good way<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know to what extent, but the game felt very scripted except for the end (where you had a lot of freedom). Although "feeling" scripted and "being" scripted are 2 different things. I know for example, most of the GM's notes were bullet points. It felt like we were supposed to do specific things, sometimes in specific orders (there were 2 instances where the GM asked us to do things in different orders because it would be better for the movie). This tight scripting allowed the GM to foreshadow in overt and covert ways almost everything that was going to happen (which greatly added to the tension). The game was full of symbolism and feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game always felt real. The GM was a good actor. Everyone stayed in character 90% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM described everything in terms of a movie. When important, he described where the camera was focused and how the camera moved. Everything was described as a scene. He even described title and end credits. And the abstract introduction collage perfectly foreshadowed what was going to happen in the movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM was your biggest fan. In general, your character was made to look positive in some way. The GM was very supporting and complimentary. Additionally, because making skill rolls almost always meant failure, he often would allow you to succeed at anything you wanted to do. You never roll to spot, listen, or research. And in a few cases where a skill was called for, if you roleplayed in a convincing and persuasive manner, you would gain a bonus or he would change his mind and no skill roll was needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a lot of modern horror, you often build up tension, then release it. Build up tension more, then release again. You keep ebbing and flowing upward till you reached the climax. In this game, there is very little release. The game is often very quiet. Sometimes even boring (except the GM is strict about you staying mostly in character, not playing with your phones, or doing anything that would alleviate this boredom). The game just slowly, slowly ratcheted up the tension to a boiling point over 4 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS ---&gt;</b> The game was also an emotional thrill ride with twist after twist. You thought you did something terrible that meant you were all going to die BUT it turns out you were safe BUT your loved ones were the ones who were going to die BUT it turns out your loved one aren't who you thought they were! <b>&lt;---SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS</b><br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we were playing real people with real problems, in a few cases characters had to deal with problems that players or people they know and care about had to deal with in their own lives. Everything was close to home. Very much like Jeepform.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS ---&gt;</b> There was a moment where the big truth was revealed in the form of an NPC telling us a story that was pre-written on 2.5 pages. Instead of the NPC talking, the GM decided that it should shown to the audience as a flash back and we should each take turns reading 1 paragraph from the story. Reading it this way was quite impactful, didn\u2019t feel monotonous (having 1 person speak for that long), and was especially chilling because it changed who are characters thought we were. This was the moment where a few people cried. <b>&lt;---SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS ---&gt;</b> The second moment where people cried was when they had to face their loved ones after finding out the truth. Life and death was on the line in a moment where you could feel your teenage characters "growing up" for the first time as they faced the people they loved who were simultaneously not the people you thought they were BUT still the people you always loved. And give than the GM naturally had a "parental" way of speaking to you the entire game, having him play your parents in a few cases was intense. <b>&lt;---SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe way control worked in the game was a rollercoaster ride. You had a lot of control then no control then a lot of control then no control. You could frame a scene and then all of a sudden you had no control. There were times you roll skills, many times you automatically succeeded, and many times you automatically failed.

I have a few Danish and Swedish friends who've run me through Danish Scenarios. They feel similar to what I experienced at Gen Con. I've also played a few freeform semi-LARP Call of Cthulhu games in Buffalo NY that were also similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key differences (from my experience) are:<br/>\n<br/>\n- My GM at Gen Con understood and fully realized the power of mixing GM driven play, freeform, shared authorship, and game mechanics. The game was at time freeform but he knew how to spice freeform up with just enough light but extremely impactful mechanics. He didn't shy away from any of the tools I've seen in the vast world of RPGs. He didn't seem to have favorites. He was all about using the right tool for the right job.<br/>\n<br/>\n- His pre-generated player handouts were not exhaustive. He was very good at focusing on just enough detail and no more. I've played similar scenarios where you have to dig for the relevant bits. This GM, having run the scenario 13 times kept focusing in on the details with the biggest payoff without losing any flavor.<br/>\n<br/>\n- He relentlessly stayed focused on using the movie metaphor to keep it all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond the above, his games screamed Danish Play to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338835/#Comment_338835" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T07:42:46+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  7:42AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run games of Dogs that reached near similar levels of raw emotion. My goal has never been to push things as far as what I experienced at Gen Con. But a huge difference (one of many differences) between my Dogs games and these games is I use minimal prep. And I think that may be the next step for these type of games. The sacred cow of weeks or months of prep to achieve these affects may need to be challenged.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I prep for Dogs, I use the town creation rules (1 hour) and then I go the extra mile of flavoring up the major NPCs (another hour). I decide which actors are playing them (sometimes a combination of 2 actors, or people I know, mixed together), their motivations, their quirks, their regrets, and something that makes them feel human / relatable / not easy to judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we play a 4 hour game, we make characters together. But the players do not create relationships. Instead, I show them the list of the major NPCs in the town with minor descriptors and everyone must choose their relationships from these characters. Each player must have at least 2 relationships with NPCs that are also connected to other players. And I tell the players to go wild defining these relationships. You can tell me that the NPC I may have thought was an honorable person who refuses to commit violence tried to kill you. Anything goes. Then I leave the table. I tell them for 10 minutes, do whatever you want\u2026 I won't be here to stop you! And I leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that 10 minutes of players forging their own relationship maps is roughly equivalent to the weeks I've seen my friends spend crafting their freeform scenarios. And the players have instant buy in!<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the issue holding back this approach might be that GM and Writer are often 2 different people in these traditions. And scaling down the Writer's contributions, even if efficient, may not be desirable in certain scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338838/#Comment_338838" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T07:55:14+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  7:55AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2011 7:59AM by thadrine.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea of any of my players becoming emotionally invested in anything confounds me.

There are also certain types of relationships that are awkward with Q&amp;A.; If someone is your father you've known your whole life, it may be weird (in some circumstances) that you didn't know beforehand that they were the Steward of the town (although we can get creative and turn those awkward moments into story twists). That said, the Q&amp;A; approach is amazing on its own and can also be layered on top of the pre-play method.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the Q&amp;A; approach in D&amp;D.; I especially love turning mooks into major characters by way of a simple question. "3 faceless Elves step from the brush and rain arrows down on your heads." Fight! "One of the Elf's hood falls back\u2026 you lock eyes\u2026 you know his eyes and he knows yours\u2026 from where?" "I don't know\u2026 I\u2026 Maybe\u2026" "You notice the Elf has a poorly healed scar down his delicate cheek as he chokes back his hate for you!" "I gave him that scar!!!" "You did! It was years ago\u2026 his name is Elias\u2026 you fought outside your sister's church\u2026. Why? What happened? What did he\u2026\u2026.." "He wanted to marry my sister but she refused and he wouldn't give up pursuing her and\u2026." Fight! "After Elias sinks an arrow into your shoulder... he clearly remembers how easily you bested him\u2026 a fair fight will only mean Elias' death\u2026 he runs!"<br/>\n<br/>\nA little bit of that sprinkled into a standard D&amp;D; combat can make for amazing moments that spiral into future encounters. Of course it depends on your players. Some players could just as easily respond with, "I don't care what his name is\u2026 how many hit points does he have left?"<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent approaches to different players!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338846/#Comment_338846" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T08:47:36+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  8:47AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, what do you mean by emotionally manipulative?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I ask is so many standard GM tricks manipulate emotions.

You go to a play and you know that's on the agenda. What is a bad thing, in my opinion, is building a situation specifically designed to evoke strong emotion dishonestly or without that consent and buy-in. I think that's what I'm wondering about, because I've seen motivational speakers work a crowd into a frenzy of emotion to further their own ends and it repelled me. What you describe seems ripe for this, since this guy apparently gets the same reaction over and over regardless of who is sitting at his table. I'm just suspicious! If I signed up for a game session, even one billed as "intense", I would not expect to cry because that's not generally part of the agreement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338879/#Comment_338879" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T11:07:07+00:00" title="August 15, 2011 11:07AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br><br>One way to answer Jason's question would be:<br><br>What things did this GM do that were NOT "standard GM tricks"? <br><br>What kind of tactics did he use to manipulate your emotions?<br><br>One I got very strongly from your writeup so far is the use of the "big shocking reveal", where things are revealed shockingly not to be what you thought they were.

Specifically, if a game is going to include racism, sexism, abuse, sex, sexual violence, violence against children\u2026 I would like to know immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to have a conversation about what people don\u2019t want in the game (I have specific methods I use for having these conversations without pressuring people to agree to things they don't want). And since not everyone knows what they don't want right away or are shy, I would like to have tools that protect them if a game becomes too personal for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn mature games I run now, I have 2 index cards. 1 index card says "Scene" on it and another has "X" on it. If you feel a scene is going too long or you don't want to play out certain details on camera, simply lift up the Scene card. If you don't feel comfortable with certain content in the game, simply lift up the X card. That content is removed, no questions asked (unless we don't understand what needs to be removed). I find these mechanisms keep everyone safe. Granted, in many games, the GM acts as the safety net keeping a vigilant lookout for problems but the GM doesn't always catch everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also my problem with some Jeepform and Nordic games I've played. If I'm in a LARP, we have very specific rules. For example, "no touching." Or if touching is allowed, we make sure everyone knows it before we start. In Jeepform games I've played, people started touching each other as they acted out scenes and some people clearly were not comfortable with this. I was surprised by the lack of pre-play discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, if we are working in an environment with pre-generated characters with dark secrets and backgrounds, I would like players to have the option to opt out of their character if the background includes content they are not comfortable with. If you have been abused as a child and someone hands you a character that seemed straight forward and then as you read the background you realize they have been abused in the same way you have\u2026 I would like there to be an easy way for people to opt out.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted, someone can always opt out or speak out even if there are no easy to use or clear ways of doing so. I've been told by many that the person who says nothing is partially at fault. I don't feel comfortable with that. I know many people who are shy, shut down when confronting certain content, or give in to peer pressure. I'd rather make it super easy for anyone to voice their discomfort and feel empowered not to have to go through an experience they don't want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this comes from having run too many to count games for hundreds of different people all over the world. I've made mistakes. It's hard. But I think there are things we can do to improve the experience for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338889/#Comment_338889" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T11:39:58+00:00" title="August 15, 2011 11:39AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [x-posted with Paul T and John]<br><br>I'm also really curious about this. If you'll forgive me John, I'm going to riff off your account on what I hear that would make me reluctant about this style of play. Let me know if I'm out of line. I should also add that I'm in no way doubting the motives of the GM whom I'm sure is an excellent person!<br><br>Firstly, that rollercoaster between  choice and choicelessness. The choice - the fact that it's a rpg and not just a story - makes it hard to retain emotional distance as you might in even the most moving film, where you're more likely to feel empathy and identification rather than a direct involvement of your own identity. But the stretches of choicelessness, the automatic failures etc, ensure that you basically have to surrender to this other figure. Having someone else in charge of your destiny for four hours is going to do something for you. (This may be very typical of many rpg sessions, but this one seems notable in the amount of preassigned emotional content)<br><br>Inhabiting a father-figure role in addition... well, I think this adds up to very much an authoritorial control figure (being nice and making others look good - when it doesn't fuck with your own agenda - is a classic way to maintain high status). The fact that this is then used to hit at family issues - common to everyone, often deep and undealt with - makes this a pretty heady mix.<br><br>I'm into Augusto Boal's work - I recently took a 3-day workshop on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Boal#The_Rainbow_of_Desire:_The_Boal_Method_of_Theatre_and_Therapy._.28London:_Routledge.2C_1995.29" rel="nofollow">Rainbow of Desire</a> - so I'm familiar with the use of theatre and story to explore and maybe deal with emotional issues. The thing I love about Boal's work is that although it depends on a strong facilitator, the exploration isn't led by an individual but by the group as a whole - everyone is a 'spectactor' (a term which resonates with a lot of the new wave of design, in my opinion!). Everyone is there to provide emotional support to the 'protagonist' and there is a chance to debrief at the very end. And ultimately, the resolution of the emotional scene returns to the individual - it's all about the chance to visit these emotional challenges and find new ways to approach them. <br><br>So I guess I'm unfairly comparing this rpg session to a very different thing. I find it helpful to sharpen what this kind of play seems notable for: a process that gets players to submit to an imposed emotional experience that cuts deep.<br><br>Anyway, those are my thoughts. I like my emotional delving, but I like it empowered and involved. This seems a different flavour entirely. Let me know if I'm off-base, or if I've touched on any differences that ring true.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338892/#Comment_338892" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T11:47:32+00:00" title="August 15, 2011 11:47AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2011 11:52AM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Call me wrong, but it sounds to me like the GM gave a very clear heads up about the emotional intensity present in the game and an invitation for social contract buy in.<br><br>He said that 10 of the 13 times he's run it, one or more players has cried.<br><br>To me, that's a huge huge combination of fair warning and invitation to come on board with him.

For example:<br/>\n<br/>\n- "If you think about it you would\u2026" or "If you love me you would\u2026"<br/>\n<br/>\n- [Make a statement that assumes something] [ask a question that pressures you to accept this assumption as fact]<br/>\n<br/>\n- Or using emphasis to codify commands within requests: When do you want to <b>go home</b>?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Or turning people against each other to artificially create forms of peer pressure to get what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Or asking fishing questions to trip up people into revealing personal info they don\u2019t want to share and then use it against them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could probably list several dozen examples without even going into using sound, eyes, and body language to manipulate. But I don't think this GM was doing any of the above.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think the GM masterfully used the game's content, mechanics, roleplaying, control of the gaming environment, his own ability to be simultaneously kind and strict, the constant player loss and gain of power in play, materials that helped us immerse into our characters who were vulnerable teenagers, his ability to come off fatherly (which is the case in all the games I played with him, it just happens this was a game where he was also playing people's fathers), sound, imagery from movies most of us have seen, and more to create a very emotional experience. Manipulative? Yes. So is a lot of GMing. But I don't think he crossed the line (or at least my line). Although as I mentioned, I would have liked more disclaimers and tools for opting out of content in game.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing up I had 2 friends who were manipulated into joining cults. I was shocked how people I cared about and knew to be intelligent would join a cult where they seemed transformed into different people. I've since read countless book after book (and been to a few seminars) to learn how people manipulate others in such perverse manners to ensure it wouldn't happen to me and it wouldn't happen to the people I love.

Perhaps two small anecdotes could suggest general environs and methods to achieving the investment necessary to feel rather than act--isn't that the crux? Most RPGs don't give you the space to really feel, because "what do you do now" is always hanging overhead?<br><br>Both anecdotes come from times of such space or lack of freedom (motivation? pressure?) to act:<br><br>Fantasy boffer LARP: Rolling battles lead to an empty campsite that we are told is "filled with corpses of the villagers", the people of my liege lord (and good friend in-game). The battle moves along--scores of people chasing the loot and XP (and re-rolling in as new adversary NPCs)--but he and I just stop and look at each other and we KNOW the other is thinking, "what the fuck? Just because we can't see the carnage, it's left the mind?"<br><br>We start to "pick up" the corpses, sorting them for burial, as we hear the shouts and laughs fade away over the ridgeline. We "bury" them; taking the better part of an hour (let's face it: no one is so into LARP to dig a mass grave for several score people and just refill it!).<br><br>We sit at his "gates" (the porch of the main cabin for that campsite) and just weep. Losing it, big time.<br><br>Not much later in the day, my character is so "drunk" trying to kill the pain that I can't (i.e. don't choose to) fight well enough and am killed. That PC "pulled a black stone"--the first in the LARP--and was no more. Permadeath. I knew it could happen, and didn't care--my PC wouldn't have.<br><br>That was possible because of the time taken, the space (just Eric and I and our mutual trust) and being willing to FEEL. I'm tearing up again, now, just remembering (and missing Eric, too, I suppose--haven't been in that group in years).<br><br>Cthulu Live at Dragoncon, with a VERY solid group of organizers: This one is harder to summarize in a meaningful way, but let's just say that the final scene is ON and the PCs have failed and it's Game Over For The World. People are trying to fight, screaming, etc... but one of the women organizing it (and playing a key NPC) and I are, in-game, lovers finally reunited. She is pregnant, we are unmarried, and death is about 30 feet away, mowing through the "acting" (not in the performance sense, in the "I try to shoot it!" sense) PCs.<br><br>I take her hands, we kneel together, and  murmur to each other about our love, and our sorrow that our child will die without ever being born. A near-dead priest sanctifies our vows with his last breaths. Tears on all sides of that "micro scene."<br><br>Again, not acting (in the "take action) sense, in full trust (because of neigh-professional-improv organizers), allowing the REAL horror--impending loss of an only-just-recovered loved one, death of an innocent; not scary lighting and impressive props--to be embraced, comprehended, and felt.<br><br>[It might have helped that I kind of started to fall for the actress, too, but that's beside the point, I think.]<br><br>----<br>Space, trust, and time left room for internalization. Give a Method Actor that kind of fuel, and he'll cry like a little girl.<br><br>My two best gaming moments ever. The tears were orthogonal--LIVING the moment took it beyond a game, and probably shaped me in some small ways, too.<br><br>*sigh* Going to go be in the sun, now. A bit verklempt....                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338918/#Comment_338918" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T13:15:49+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  1:15PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sort of derailing, but simplifying the discussion here. How often do the words, "Right people. Right situation." come into play whenever we discuss the perfect storm of gaming elements. For years I've always wanted to run a game or play in a game with this kind of emotional investment. My favorite movie of all time is Shanghai Triad... if you've not seen it the emotional apex of this film is angst-ridden and debilitating. Todd Solondz is another of my favorite directors. Just hammering home the discomfort.<br><br>Anyway.<br><br>I've been gaming since 1981 (that's right, I'm that old) and in that time, 85% of my gaming experiences have been with people who think zombie movies are good. Which is a fine flavor for some. But I don't watch zombie movies, let alone play games where killing zombies for 90 minutes is exciting. Sadly, the only people who can stand to be around me tend to be people who enjoy bad movies. Which leads to a lot of game sessions for me where the IDEAL is way over there and I'm playing over here.<br><br>So. In closing your honor, I think these perfect storm scenarios will always be derived by surrounding yourself with the right people.<br><br>ASIDE<br>I have a samurai game I'm making. If you know me than you know I've worked on all four editions of a particular samurai game. I know samurai. I know how to write samurai fables, etc.<br><br>My game is deep (and I hope meaningful), about a family of samurai dealing with the guilt of murdering their lord. But that doesn't stop guys from showing up at a convention game and fart during play before calling out "safety." Oh yeah. True story.<br><br>Did I mention I was really really jealous of John playing this game without me?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338938/#Comment_338938" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T14:56:25+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  2:56PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2011 2:59PM by Vernon R.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your story of gaming is pretty typical of gaming in general Jim, but it's obvious that something more is going on with the game originally referenced.

This GM straddles the line well between kind and strict. He firmly establishes his rules in regards to table behavior (no calls at the table, no making jokes of the material, he is the 'director') and character/player behavior (you will get the opportunity to frame some scenes/add details, no correcting anachronisms, etc.) <br><br>While I don't necessarily know that for long term play, this rigidity on the part of the GM would work for me, but for a con game, it's great. By being stern at the beginning, he establishes a feeling of safety from the other players, a feeling of being able to safely explore things without someone farting away your moment. <br><br>Now, these structures may not appeal to everyone..I know that at certain Cons, I already implicitly trust the attendees in that way, just by virtue of the nature of the games. (What I mean is, games that deal with mature/difficult subjects in their very nature). But I think, by taking a directorial (or dictatorial <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) approach, this GM heads off any questions of player agency, authorship, safety and just lets the players be free to play.<br><br>Also, I'd like to add that I've played games with this guy that are more "action" oriented (like, little to no character exploration at all) and have still had an absolute blast. He is a great GM and whenever people at Cons ask me which games to try and get into I, begrudgingly...(they may be taking my spot after all) point them his way.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338952/#Comment_338952" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T16:42:53+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  4:42PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>I think your story of gaming is pretty typical of gaming in general Jim, but it's obvious that something more is going on with the game originally referenced.

It happened this march, when I played my game <i>The Dreaming Crucible</i> at the Gomestorm convention with one old friend, and one new one. The other players didn't cry, but were very supportive and present with me in that moment.<br><br><b>What caused this reaction?</b> Well, <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/a-piece-of-myself/" rel="nofollow">I blogged about it,</a> like I do, but in brief:<br><br>So, as the Dark Faerie player it's my duty to play harsh influences on a troubled teenager, both in the real world and in Faerie. Lisa, the Hero player, chose a Seed from the book about an angry father chewing out a sullen son, and it was job to frame that scene. I  fished around mentally for a "hook" for playing the dad, and grabbed onto some mannerisms of my own angry father as a basis. As we played that scene, I ended up playing him more and more as <i>my</i> Dad, and when the boy Trevor came back home from his Faerie quest, the strength, bravery and forgiveness he showed his father caused me to just break. We called scene, I explained what I'd been dealing with, and started crying. Hugs all around.<br><br>I didn't set out to engineer some sort of catharsis for myself. I was just saying what I saw in the moment, what I felt was true (this is a rule of the game, in fact). And the truth was that this dad was my dad. I knew exactly how to play him, because I <i>knew</i> him. And the simple and pure way that Lisa described Trevor's forgiveness resonated with me, because things with my dad had seemed so <i>complex</i> and he died with so much unsaid between us. It felt heart-wrenching and wonderful to dredge all those feelings up and giving a new level of closure to them before putting them to bed again.<br><br>Supportive and thoughtful players were definitely key. Even though I'd just met one of them, they both bought into the "I Will Not Abandon You" foundation of the game in a way that told me it was safe to go there, even before I knew what "there" we were going to.<br><br>*          *          *<br><br>I've had a few "almost-cries" in games; times where events moved me but I didn't quite break into tears, just misted up. I think this is far more common for me, not because I'm afraid to cry or be vulnerable or what have you, but because I'm trying to control myself for the sake of the roleplaying. <i>Especially</i> in a game where the material is moving and meaningful, I don't want to break the spell by having to bawl, recover myself, and dive back in. So I'm going to restrain my outward reaction at least enough to continue playing, because we've just gotten to the good stuff!\n<ul>\n<li>I played two games with Vincent Baker when he came out to the Gamestorm two years ago (<a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/tragic-trajectories/" rel="nofollow">again with the blogging</a>). I discovered Vincent has a way, in person, of really inhabiting pained NPCs in such a way that whey that character is in agony, you <i>feel it</i>. His voice catches, his eyes get dewy, and your heart aches for that character. At least mine did. And my own character (especially in the Dogs game) was particularly in sync with the NPC's emotions. I didn't cry, but very nearly.</li>\n<li>At Go Play NW two years ago I played Montsegur 1244 with John Aegard and others (and, you guessed it, <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/montsegur/" rel="nofollow">blogged about it</a>!). There were a couple of aspects of that game that brought me to near-tears. One was <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12217&amp;page=1#Comment_278451" rel="nofollow">the unfolding story of the boy Amiel</a>, and how we who were playing the soldiers were taking him under our wing, and inadvertently crushing his child's soul in molding him into a soldier. By the end of the game the boy Amiel was gone, replaced by a hollow, self-denying martyr. It was agonizing.<br><br>And the other, closer to home theme that wrenched my heart was the Captain Pierre Roger (my primary character) and his dead, lifeless marriage. Right from the start the creeping separation between him and his wife Philippa (played by Susan, I think) was apparent, and it only grew. he was shut out of her life entirely, and their newborn son, finding comfort in the arms of Arsende the Harlot, but longing for intimacy with his family. This matched up, symbolically, NOT in actual details, with some difficulties my wife and I were having, and helped me to recognize and address that.</br></br></li>\n<li>I <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=31553.0" rel="nofollow">played another Dreaming Crucible game</a> with Lisa from the first example, and her friend Alex. It got darker than any other Crucible game has, at least any that I've played. <b>[TRIGGER WARNING</b>] Lisa chose a Seed that implied some heavy abuse or threat of abuse, and we established a situation with a creepy uncle as a houseguest who keeps trying to get the young girl to get drunk, loosen up and "have fun" with him. In the Faerie journey, in the course of saying what we each saw and following the fiction, I ended up, as the Dark Faerie, with the unpleasant duty of describing a negative outcome that could only be the spirit-rape of the girl by the shadow-form of her uncle. So I did, in a brief sketch of detail that, I hoped, focused just enough on the emotional tone without being too graphic.<br><br>Nobody quite lost it, but we were all pretty stricken, needing a moment, etc. And after the game we talked a bit to decompress. In the end, I think the trauma of that scene served to heighten the triumph when the girl stood up, unbroken, before her Faerie adversary and to her uncle in the real world. We didn't know that at the time, though. The Crucible does not ensure a happy outcome. There was no sense of "this will be OK because she'll get to overcome it in the end." We were just following where the story led with honesty.</br></br></li>\n</ul>\nIn none of these cases did I or the other players go in with the intention of provoking those specific emotions. But I think we DID go in with the intention of approaching some serious shit with vulnerability and bravery. And magic happened. So yes, it's a "perfect storm" sort of event, and not something reliably duplicable <i>per se</i>, but it's the kind of thing you CAN steer toward by fostering a certain intentionality and openness.<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338986/#Comment_338986" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T00:39:08+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 12:39AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as John's mystery GM goes, I'm intrigued and would like to try this game, but I will admit I'm a bit off-put by his particular brand of intentionality, as you've described (I read most of the description, but not the SPOILERS! parts). I would never say I'm <i>suspicious</i>--you're reporting that the situation was non-abusive, and that's enough for me. But I find it difficult to engage with emotional vulnerability when someone's holding themselves apart from me rather than being right there with me putting their emotions on the line.<br><br>There's a significant strain of classical GM advice that's all about "making" the players feel this and that. "I'm running a horror campaign, how can I make the players really feel scared?" "The PCs keep killing off all my NPCs! How can I make them care about them?" "I've got this tragic arc in mind for the game's climax; how can I make the players really invest in how sad it is?"<br><br>There's a functional question at the core of these kinds of inquiries, which is "how can we foster emotional investment at the table?" But it's encrusted with so many assumptions, about power dynamics, GM-as-performer, etc. that it's nearly impossible, in my experience, to really address the issue of functional, mutual techniques. It tends to be more about tricking the (other) players to feel emotions, just like you trick them into following a plot hook and so forth.<br><br>When I <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/whats-your-trajectory/" rel="nofollow">asked on my blog</a> for people to share character trajectories that personally move them, this guy Kevin responded, "On rare occasions I have actually brought tears to the eyes of my players when I endangered a NPC that they\u2019ve come to enjoy during a Game. I consider it the highest complement to my story line when I can manage it but save the attempts for important twists in the gaming."<br><br>I asked him if he'd ever had his own emotions engaged that way as a player and he was like, "uh, no." It definitely seemed like something that GMs do TO players.<br><br>Sounds like this guy did well at putting the assumptions and techniques out on the table. That's great! Far better than trying to slip the emotions in without the players noticing or whatever. My own instinct would be to explain expectations and warn about emotional subject matter, but stop short of saying "most people cry at this game," since that would seem to weight the results toward that. But whatever! Transparent social contract is good!<br><br>I still feel a little weird about the whole thing because, as I say, I want all the players, including the GM, to be right there with me in vulnerability-ville, not not holding back and orchestrating the experience. The vulnerability of a GM comes from a <i>different place</i> than the vulnerability of an ordinary player--that of having to <i>put pressure</i> on characters we care about, rather than responding to pressure--but it's still vulnerability. In my Dreaming Crucible examples above, I was playing the role of adversity-provider, but I was very emotionally involved; providing that adversity was <i>agonizing</i>, and I had to fight to not flinch from it.<br><br>So, I dunno. It sounds like his setup requires a very specific manner and method, and he's got it down pat. I wouldn't ask him to alter that. I just wonder how I'd feel playing under those conditions.<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338988/#Comment_338988" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T00:47:41+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 12:47AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with John's OP: yes, a "perfect storm"can come up, with players A, B, and C; and such and such just-right scenario and situations. That's trivially true, right?<br><br>That's why I thought my APs were useful. One with a friend, another with a stranger; one built out of a mere plot point, one out of ephemeral encounter; one at a long-running private game; one at a con. I thought it valuable to find the commonalities. Neither involved "GM techniques" nor manipulation of the players nor an uninvested provocateur.<br><br>Time. Space. Trust.<br><br/>With no time to feel, pressed to act... Won't happen.<br/>With no space to be within oneself... Won't happen.<br/>With no trust in those who will see... Won't happen.<br/><br/>If we can all play with this consummate GM, we don't need to discuss anything.<br/>Is there anything to discuss about this subject when we play with ANY GM... Or no GM? In any system... Or outside of a game's system?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm missing the thread...?                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

He firmly establishes his rules in regards to table behavior (no calls at the table, no making jokes of the material, he is the 'director') and character/player behavior (you will get the opportunity to frame some scenes/add details, no correcting anachronisms, etc.)<br/><br/>While I don't necessarily know that for long term play, this rigidity on the part of the GM would work for me, but for a con game, it's great. By being stern at the beginning, he establishes a feeling of safety from the other players, a feeling of being able to safely explore things without someone farting away your moment.<br/><br/>Now, these structures may not appeal to everyone..I know that at certain Cons, I already implicitly trust the attendees in that way, just by virtue of the nature of the games. (What I mean is, games that deal with mature/difficult subjects in their very nature). But I think, by taking a directorial (or dictatorial <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) approach, this GM heads off any questions of player agency, authorship, safety and just lets the players be free to play.<br/><br/>Also, I'd like to add that I've played games with this guy that are more "action" oriented (like, little to no character exploration at all) and have still had an absolute blast. He is a great GM and whenever people at Cons ask me which games to try and get into I, begrudgingly...(they may be taking my spot after all) point them his way.</blockquote>\nNoam, thanks so much for posting these thoughts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338997/#Comment_338997" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T06:37:24+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  6:37AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I may have cried once in a LARP. But they weren't tears of me being upset, they were tears of my character being upset. I was riding that wave of emotional intensity, the same way you might enjoy a nightmare or a horror film.<br/><br/>I've certainly caused other players to cry (although I couldn't say what kind of tears), notably in a very LARPy game of Call of Cthulhu in which we were encouraged to play out scenes rather than describe them. One occasion was when being insane and near catatonic, the other was when I caused another player to stab me in a sacrifice to save everyone else. The game was set in an asylum and we all thought we were mad. Actually most of the characters weren't but mine certainly was. It was a very emotionally charged game as much stress was brought to bear upon the characters (and hence players).<br/><br/>I almost caused someone to cry in a roleplaying excercise at work. We were playing dealing with difficult staff. One person would play the manager, the other the difficult member of staff. Most of the time the training went like this:<br/><br/>Manager: there's a problem.<br/>Member of staff: yes there is.<br/>Manager: here's how you can change.<br/>Member of staff: OK.<br/><br/>That didn't seem useful so when it was my turn to be difficult, I was difficult. I played a member of staff who would habitually come in late because of drinking the night before. I was obfuscatory and glib. The manager just didn't know what to say, became extremely frustrated and ended up almost crying and almost shouting at me. We just pulled back in time. It certainly made the training more interesting but I don't know if it was any more useful, because she wasn't ready for it. It was probably a bit evil of me.<br/><br/>I don't think I've had tears in Dogs although Fort Lemon has certainly provoked strong reactions, especially as you pile misery upon misery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339019/#Comment_339019" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T10:51:19+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 10:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember wanting to cry on three different occasions during roleplaying games, but one... i don't really cry and two... i didn't feel safe.<br/><br/>And I think the safety issue is a lot bigger than the "i don't cry" issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339025/#Comment_339025" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T11:12:19+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 11:12AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Time.

I\u2019m the GM who ran the game that jenskot posted about. Via this post, I request jenskot to rescind the rule that my name not be mentioned in the thread so that I can properly introduce myself. Until then, I\u2019ll follow the rule, like everyone else. I\u2019m all about the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you tell I haven\u2019t figured this Whispering thing out?<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve never before inserted myself into an online discussion of one of my games -- and the Interwebs are littered with them -- out of fear that it would inhibit the free expression of players\u2019 opinions. I\u2019m here for two reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I have to admit that I\u2019m disconcerted by some of the speculation about my motivations for \u201cmaking players cry.\u201d I assure you that I don\u2019t take any of the speculation personally. But I\u2019d hate for a potential player to one day stumble across this thread, deduce who I am, and conclude that she doesn\u2019t want to play in my games because she thinks my intent is malevolent. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo let\u2019s make speculation unnecessary. Ask and I\u2019ll tell. I have no secrets. In fact, if you reread jenskot\u2019s detailed description of my adventure, you\u2019ll spot many elements that are mentioned in the thread entitled "Traditional RPGs GMing best practices." Most of the techniques I use are well established. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to beg your patience, though. I\u2019m a stranger to this forum, and I don\u2019t know your conventions, such as when it\u2019s appropriate to start a new thread. I also don\u2019t know any of what I\u2019ll call the \u201cvocabulary of indie game theory,\u201d so please forgive me if I misspeak. Be patient and guide me, and I\u2019ll happily follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and for the record, I am also extremely flattered by many of your comments. Thank you. I confess to a tinge of regret that I\u2019ll, without a doubt, shatter the mystique that this thread has woven around this Mythical GM. I hope you won\u2019t be too crestfallen to discover that I\u2019m just a regular dweeb.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second reason for posting is that I don\u2019t want to become known as \u201cthat guy who always makes people cry.\u201d I\u2019ve designed (or co-designed) and run 48 tabletop RPG scenarios and five LARPs. I\u2019ve run pulp, high fantasy, cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, and horror, which is admittedly my favorite genre. Players have told me that most of my convention sessions are lots of fun -- especially the later ones, as I\u2019ve improved my GM skills. I like to think that now, all of my scenarios invite the players to immerse themselves in the game, to whatever degree they feel comfortable. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game jenskot played in is my only scenario that has consistently empowered players to express emotional reactions that they might not normally express at a gaming table. But the scenario is just a catalyst. I believe David Artman aptly explained the elements that allowed the reaction to go to completion, to continue the chemical analogy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, your observations have made me realize I have not provided an adequate opt-out mechanism for players who find that they\u2019re getting uncomfortable. I\u2019ll correct that deficiency immediately. Thank you all for bringing that to my attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my original point was, I run lots of stuff that doesn\u2019t make people cry! And players tell me those games are fun, too -- like DorkThought did above. Thanks very much for chiming in, DT. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I\u2019m here. Hi. If the depth of this discussion has already been plumbed, that\u2019s fine. But if not, I\u2019ll open the floor to questions. Let\u2019s start with, um \u2026 you, in the blue shirt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339347/#Comment_339347" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T21:15:12+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  9:15PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 9:19PM by jenskot.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rule rescinded!<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to Story Games Todd!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was bombarded (in a good way) with whisper after whisper asking who you were and where people could play your games.

My name is Todd Furler, and it's an honor to be here.<br/><br/>John, your description of the game was quite accurate, and extremely thorough. If I remember anything differently and it becomes relevant to a conversation, I'll chime in.<br/><br/>David, the single most important thing that the players do in a typical UA game, mine included, is making stress checks for their characters. And by "make," I mean "attempt," not "succeed at." UA is all about stress, and it has elegant mechanics for quantifying and handling it. As jenskot pointed out, I won't ask for a skill check unless the character is in a stressful situation. So in a very general sense, even my skill checks are stress checks.<br/><br/>In a typical four-hour UA scenario of mine, a character will generally make about a dozen stress checks and one or two skill checks.<br/><br/>So I would say that most of the players' interaction with the game consists of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor your character's stressors to see if the current situation triggers any of them. Each character has three specific stressors on his character sheet.</li>\n<li>When you or the GM decide your character is stressed, make a stress check for your character.</li>\n<li>If the stress check fails (which it automatically does, if one of the three predefined stressors was triggered), decide your character's response at a very high level (fight, flee, or freeze). Then sit back and watch the train wreck.</li>\n<li>When none of the above are happening, contribute to the story.</li>\n</ul>\nLet me know if I've misinterpreted your question or if you were looking for something else.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339374/#Comment_339374" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T03:26:24+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  3:26AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made a player cry.

I still am, a little, if only because you've built this finely tuned machine that returns consistent emotional results.

I trust John and don't think you are up to no good, though, just something I'm not entirely familiar with.<br><br>I facilitate Montsegur 1244 pretty regularly, and that game has a very heavy and emotionally wrenching tone more often than not. I've played very intense Jeepform games as well (John's right about the lack of expressed boundaries in Jeep play, which is a cultural artifact I suspect). And I've written games engineered to be affecting, but in each of these cases, outcomes are entirely player dependent. One group might get all emo while another charts a different, less emotionally invested course. <br><br>So a question - what are you doing with (or to) the <i>player dynamic at the table</i> that drives this particular game toward predictable emotional territory?

Todd's games are routinely hard to get into \u2013 and becoming moreso now that word of mouth is the way it is<br/>2. Nevertheless, I've been savoring his Unknown Armies games since Origins 2001 (with the adventure about the CDs that drove everyone insane), and <i>telling everyone about them</i>. Then my friends all want to get into his games while we're at Origins and so forth, compounding the "problem."<br/>3. John plays in one of his UA games at GenCon 2011, and realizes immediately this stuff is brilliant, but doesn't want to share it with the world on account of Point 1 above<br/>4. Nevertheless, John <i>has</i> to say <i>something</i> about it, so he does it behind a very thin veil<br/>5. Many people on this forum have played in Todd's games (Jared, Nick, myself, dozens of others) and recognize immediately what's going on<br/>6. Meanwhile, I thought I'd alert Todd about this (based on the intensity of the discussion), and he winds up joining the SG forum<br/>7. Now slots in his games will become a coveted commodity by the SG clique as well, as we use our limited tools to dissect "how they work" etc.  Boo.<br/><br/>Oh well.<br/><br/>Anyway, to Todd's technique (sorry, to embarass you!):<br/><br/>Like he said, he draws from the book of "Traditional RPGs GMing best practices." \xa0He's organized, focused and deliberate.  More to the point, he's interested in two major things: A) keeping the spotlight shifting around his matrix of 6-7 characters as they encounter the well-conceived plot twists / random Stress-check failures virtually built into his scenario and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> ensuring the characters have enough interiority so that the players comprehend the full ramifications of each twist as it comes.<br/><br/>He's got, like, a check-list in front of him of the various events that'll transpire (all the Story Gamers shout in unison: Railroading!)<br/>BUT it's really no different than a Front in <i>Apocalypse World</i> \u2013 the pressure keeps increasing, building to a climax as the Front advances, usually involving a single dice roll or critical decision taken by everyone in the party. It is a highly effective formula for experienced role-players looking for a smart Character Simulationist scenario.<br/><br/>That being said, there was at least one instance of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer" rel="nofollow">griefer</a> dude (who incidentally played in my wife's Panty Explosion game with the same play-style) who was deliberately obstinate and misogynistic in one of Todd's Origins UA games back in 2007 or 2008, and that didn't go so well.  So there has to be a level of shared maturity at the table.<br/><br/>Most of the time, most convention GMs assume you're a gomer off the street ready to engage with his/her fiction.  Todd makes you feel like a reasonable, rational adult player, so that then your characters can be reduced to quivering piles of self-pity by the end...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339416/#Comment_339416" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T07:59:19+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  7:59AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome, Todd!<br/><br/>I look forward to your answers, and please don't feel shy about "not knowing the vocabulary of indie game theory". That's entirely unnecessary!<br/><br/>I have my questions, too, but I'll wait a little, so as not to pile on.<br/><br/>I think this thread will receive a lot of attention, mostly positive, but also some suspicious or distrusting, because of this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>It seems to me to be a "done right" example of a style of play that many indie RPG fans have soured on because it's so frequently done wrong</blockquote>\nTo many of the people on this forum (possibly including myself), "The GM made us cry" is associated with stories like the lovely one on YouTube of that GM who explains how awesome a GM he is because he had the paladin of his female player sent to hell and raped repeatedly until she cried.<br/><br/>Now, it's pretty clear from both your testimony and John's that this is not at all the case here. Still, to some readers it's hard to imagine a different way. Many of the people drawn to "indie games" have always wanted that kind of gameplay but never achieved it, so it's a kind of white whale for them. <br/><br/>So, you'll have to be patient with "us" too!

I can see why Unknown Armies is a good choice for this type of experience!  But I'm guessing that monitoring stress, making checks, and choosing reactions isn't the whole story.  That may be the whole story in terms of interaction with the game engine, but there's a layer of <i>how</i> a player does it that I think is important.  If I play and go through the motions, rolling and deciding without much caring, I doubt I'm contributing much to the overall experience for the group.  Whereas if I'm demonstrating a lot of emotional impact, whether it be through yelling, crying, or just well-chosen description of the subtle actions of a shaken character, then I bet I'm really helping make the game a good one.<br/><br/>In a way, my main responsibility as a player is to allow myself to be affected* and to express it.  To lend resonance to the events of play via sharing my character's reactions in a way that connects with the other players.<br/><br/>Your GM techniques** and the UA system then provide a setting in which most players can in fact do that.<br/><br/>What do you think?

I can easily see how that scene would be moving.<br/><br/>There's only one time I recall crying as a player in an RPG. It was a game at my friends' house. We were starting up a Mage campaign and, after we finished creating our characters, the GM asked us to narrate a scene introducing our characters.<br/><br/>My character was an engineer who designed medical equipment for a living. I had decided that in my character's background, he had had an identical twin brother who died as a the result of a car accident. So my introductory scene was my character sitting in his brother's hospital room shortly after the accident. My character realizes that he's had a hand in designing about 25% of the equipment that's connected to his brother's battered body, and yet there's absolutely nothing he can do to help his brother now. As I was describing my character's helplessness, I suddenly and quite unexpectedly began to cry.<br/><br/>It immediately made the other players uncomfortable, which made me uncomfortable (as did the embarrassment of not seeing the tears coming), so I squelched it and ended the scene.<br/><br/>My gaming friends at home are great people, but they're not comfortable with such displays of emotion. I think it's because they can't tell if it's the character or the player who's crying.<br/><br/>I should also mention there's this one game I can't run without crying. (Guess which one?) I admit that I try to hide that from the players, usually with little success. Players at my table generally haven't batted an eye if another player cries. But my perception is that it's different if I cry. It throws some folks way off balance, I suppose because I project such a strong presence as the GM. I guess it would be like hearing the pilot of your plane crying on the intercom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339545/#Comment_339545" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T16:09:56+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  4:09PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Three questions:<br/><br/>1.

After you handled it, did it ever happen again? What did you do then?</blockquote>\n1. Sure. I\u2019ve never had anyone do anything egregious, like try to destroy our movie, but transgressions occur. Probably the most common one is someone getting carried away and starting to tell a humorous out-of-character story during one of the most serious scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>2. First, I need to talk a bit about what you call the social contract. I get the impression that for most of the people here, your social contracts are negotiated. For a convention game, mine is not. Mine is dictated. It amounts to \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do and how we\u2019ll do it. Sign here, metaphorically speaking, and we\u2019ll get started.\u201d<br/><br/>That probably sounds harsh to you. I have many reasons for doing it that way, but that\u2019s probably grist for another thread. For now, it would help if you just accept the following:\n<ul>\n<li>The convention supports me in this approach. I am responsible for <i>absolutely everything</i> that happens at my table. I\u2019ll fulfill my duties. In return, I expect your cooperation.</li>\n<li>By comparing myself to the director of the movie, I set the expectation that I want and need the players\u2019 input, but I\u2019m the one in charge of the overall project.</li>\n<li>But I don\u2019t have to be a dick about it. My humor tends to be self-deprecating. I treat the players respectfully. I introduce them to each other at the start of the session. I try to memorize players\u2019 names and address them by name throughout the game. You get the idea.</li>\n</ul>\nWhen somebody runs afoul of the contract -- we\u2019ll use our example above of the out-of-character story -- I say, gently but firmly, \u201cI need you to stay in character\u201d or \u201cI need you to pay attention to the tone of the movie.\u201d As far as I can remember, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever had to do.<br/><br/>Bear in mind, this is my response to transgressions of specific behaviors I identified at the start of the session. I don\u2019t expect players to read my mind. If someone does something that I think is counterproductive, but I didn\u2019t cover in the contract, I\u2019ll usually ask what\u2019s going on. It might be something important in the real world, and that always comes first.<br/><br/>3. Occasionally. When tension builds in a horror game, players frequently turn to out-of-character humor for a little release. I\u2019ll allow some of that. But if it interferes with the movie, I\u2019ll repeat my earlier admonition (\u201cI need you to stay in character\u201d). I\u2019ve never had to escalate my warnings, for example, by getting louder. Often, the second occurrence will be policed by the other players.<br/><br/>Now, everything I wrote above is my aspiration, and I can usually come very close to it. But every once in a while, I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I overreact. I\u2019m working on raising my professionalism to the same level as my preparation.\n<blockquote>My wife and I GM a lot for a wide variety of people (we manage a local gaming community that reaches over a 1,000 people). We're always looking to pick up new tricks, find new inspiration, and expand our palate of GM techniques.<br/><br/>In our household, we've coined the phrase. "GMing the Todd Furler way\u2026 gently, patient, fair but strict and direct."</blockquote>\nCriminy! I've got something named after me. Just like Mr. Heimlich.<br/><br/>I really have no idea how well these techniques will work with a random assortment of players. I seem to be blessed with top-notch players on a regular basis. (Perhaps because of the whispering campaigns that Evan talked about?) Whatever the reason, they make my job really easy.<br/><br/>FYI, I've gotten a lot of mileage out of being direct. In two recent adventures, including the one you played in, I've said "Cut! OK, this next thing that's about to happen is the Maguffin. It <i>has</i> to go off. If you think your character would try to stop it, you'll have to come up with an explanation of why that attempt fails. Ready? Action!"<br/><br/>No player has ever fought me on doing that. In fact, the results have been some truly memorable scenes.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339568/#Comment_339568" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T18:36:49+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  6:36PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Evan, you wrote:<br/><br/>&lt; blockquote&gt;7.

I\u2019m pretty sure I break just about every indie rule there is.<br/><br/>And I don\u2019t think analysis is a bad thing, as long as it doesn\u2019t happen at the game table while the game is running. If you want to play and analyze afterward, as jenskot did, that\u2019s great. Or if you want to watch (but not play) and analyze in real time, that\u2019s OK, too.<br/><br/>Just don\u2019t try to simultaneously play and analyze at my table. I need you to be \u201call in,\u201d and our movie comes first.<br/><br/>Your summary of my technique is pretty close to the mark. I do want to comment on this:\n<blockquote>He's got, like, a check-list in front of him of the various events that'll transpire (all the Story Gamers shout in unison: Railroading!)<br/>BUT it's really no different than a Front in Apocalypse World\u2026 </blockquote>\nI know nothing about Apocalypse World. Let me tell you what\u2019s in that check list so that those who are interested can make a fair comparison.\n<ul>\n<li>The back story that leads up to the adventure, including a timeline of everything of significance.</li>\n<li>A list of scenes that I expect to put into the movie. Some of the scenes contain elements that are mandatory (clues, foreshadowing, etc.). Others are there as contingencies.</li>\n<li>A bulleted list of the information that\u2019s necessary for me to frame each scene.</li>\n<li>At the end of the document, there\u2019s a page that describes a possible way, in either game-mechanics or story terms, of how to conduct the climactic scene.</li>\n</ul>\nThat\u2019s it. Jenskot guessed that my list contains actions that I expect the player characters will take. Nope. Other than in the introductory scene, the PCs aren\u2019t even mentioned in my GM notes. I start each scene (except possibly for scenes a player calls for) and then step back. I spend the rest of the scene reacting to the players. When the point of the scene has been made (and every scene has to have a point -- I pay for the film by the inch), I cut to the next scene.<br/><br/>And thanks very much for your observation on how I treat my players.

As it was I get a little choked up, but was embarassed to:<br/><br/>A game of <i>Mountain Witch</i> run by Judd Karlman where my samurai had killed all the children of a village because of the displeasure of the daimyo. When he climbed Mt. Fuji, the children haunted him the whole way up - whispering in shadows, touching his hair while he slept. The other samurai thought he was completely insane. We reached the climax of my character's Dark Fate or whatever it's called, and he was confronted by the ghosts of the children. I said, "Okay, that's it. He kneels and prostrates before them, and I think they tear him apart. He's dead," and Judd said, "No, you are going to roll, and if you succeed <i>they forgive you</i>." I succeeded, and it still makes me tear up to remember it. Judd described the children coming forward and laying their hands on my samurai's head and then disappearing. And after that the samurai became this awesome badass force of good.<br/><br/>I've told that anecdote probably a dozen times on this forum, but it's still probably the most powerful moment in any game I've played.<br/><br/>I have other ones but not a lot of time.

Here's how a session runs, from my perspective.<br/><br/>As you can tell from John\u2019s earlier descriptions, my player briefing makes it clear that I want the players to participate and contribute. Focus on making our movie. Always keep the audience engaged. But don't <i>become</i> the audience: Don't start talking about how this scene reminds you of an episode of <i>Seinfeld</i> or telling us about the fantastic steak you had last night.<br/><br/>Then I give the players their character hand-out. One of the things I love about Unknown Armies is that when you finish reading the hand-out, you <i>know</i> your character. You know what he cares about and what he hates and who he\u2019s best friends with. So you\u2019ve got a character you understand and can sympathize with.<br/><br/>After I teach the rules, I describe the opening credits and the scene that runs behind the opening credits. Then I frame the opening scene and say, \u201cOK, you\u2019re all in the parking lot, waiting for the drop-off. I need the movie audience to see the tension. And this is where you make your first impression on the audience. What do you want them to learn about you right away? We\u2019ll start with you -- tell me exactly what the movie audience sees.\u201d I\u2019m very active in the first scene, until the players start to get comfortable with their characters. Then I can pull back.<br/><br/>Because the game mechanics are both lightweight and infrequently invoked, the players can on focus making a good movie rather than making a good die roll.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie continues the pattern. I keep the camera moving from player to player, so that everyone\u2019s engaged. I\u2019ve designed the scenario and the characters in tandem, so that I can ensure each has hooks into the other. Sometimes the player characters push the story forward; other times, the story (or nonplayer characters) push the PCs forward.<br/><br/>None of the scenes have a predetermined ending, but every scene has a purpose (find the clue, talk with Bob, foreshadow the storm, whatever), because I hate scenes where the players have no idea what to do. There\u2019s something or someone that <i>will</i> interact with the characters in each scene. When I feel the audience has seen enough, I cut to the next scene.<br/><br/>One thing we haven\u2019t discussed yet: I believe that everyone understands movies. Even if you don\u2019t know what a jump cut is, everybody knows, through constant exposure to the medium, how movies are supposed to work. Once they get started, players quickly figure out how to tell the story in terms of \u201cwhat the audience sees\u201d rather than \u201cwhat I do.\u201d And we all know that movies invite you to become emotionally involved with them. I live the movie analogy in my games, and I think that\u2019s a big part of what makes my games accessible.<br/><br/>So, to summarize, the things that I think keep the players involved are:\n<ul>\n<li>Sympathetic characters that feel like real people, with real relationships and real problems.<br/></li><li>An engaging story that\u2019s internally consistent (because plot holes drive me nuts).<br/></li><li>Every scene has a purpose and something that will interact with the characters or that the characters can interact with.<br/></li><li>Aggressive control of pacing.<br/></li><li>Milking the movie analogy for all that it\u2019s worth.</li></ul>\nI hope that's more helpful.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339782/#Comment_339782" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T17:19:16+00:00" title="August 20, 2011  5:19PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2011 5:22PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hooray, welcome, Todd!

Not a bad one per see, but some people will opt off my games because of it when I announce I'm going for a "serious game".<br/><br/>Reading this whole thread has been rather fascinating. There's a lot in common between what is being described, and the way I run those games:<br/><br/>- Clear warning at the start ("Well, this time/tonight I'd like to go for a serious one" has become the ritual sentence). I describe with relative precision what they can expect from the game (one game about racism left a couple players rather... bitter, so I make it a point to be very precise from the start now). I demand a certain level of commitment to the game. We decide on a a safe-word (again something I would never had thought of until the first time I had a player cry. We ended up in my kitchen baking.a cake and making coffee, trying to lighten the mood). <br/><br/>- I use a very controlled environment. Rules are often tailor made (though drawing from a common pool - anyone who's played with me knows most of the tricks and will quickly adjust to the particular combination used) to generate the kind of tension I want (well hopefully at least... practice tend to differ from theory). Characters are premade. I frame every scene. I try to keep the control of pace at all cost  (reading Todd's "Aggressive control of pacing" made me actually realize that this is exactly what I do, though I had never thought about it that way).<br/><br/>- At the same time I give almost complete control of what happens during those scenes once they've been set. Once the scene is set, I only react.<br/><br/>- One thing I noticed: I'm a really bad actor, so I mostly stick to very neutral modes of expression while in character. Most of my work is done via descriptions. While I would say it makes me a rather dull GM for certain types of games, for those I think it actually contributes to the impact.

I couldn't imagine I'm the only GM who's gotten this kind of response from players. <br/><br/>Not counting "The Haunting of Devon Court" (the adventure that started this thread), I recall two other adventures of mine where players have cried, but they were one-offs -- one player, one time each. I can say with certainty that in both of those cases, the players chose to involve themselves emotionally with the story.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emeraude</cite>I describe with relative precision what they can expect from the game (one game about racism left a couple players rather... bitter, so I make it a point to be very precise from the start now).</blockquote>\nI absolutely agree with being up front about what the movie's about. But what if a sensitive thing is a secondary (or teriary, even) element of the adventure? For example, I've sketched out next year's UA adventure, and the description will carry a warning similar to the following: "A real-world hate group is a small but signficant element of this adventure. Through their characters, players will be exposed to some of this hate group's rhetoric."<br/><br/>But if one of the player characters in this adventure has something sensitive in his background -- physical abuse, for example -- would you also reveal that to all the players at the start of the game? I confess to being torn on this.\n<blockquote>- One thing I noticed: I'm a really bad actor, so I mostly stick to very neutral modes of expression while in character.

I like playing my NPCs. (Don't confuse that with "I like my NPCs." I enjoy playing them, but I have no emotional attachment to them. As a GM, I can't afford to -- you never know when your players are going to decide to off them.) After jenskot's game, one of the players paid me a very high compliment when she said that my protrayal of each of the PCs parents clearly came across as a different person. That's always one of my worries -- that all my characters will sound alike.<br/><br/>But I think there are times when your way might be better. I've seen that some players find it jarring when one second I'm playing an NPC who's tearfully begging a PC for forgiveness, and then instaneously transform into an even-voiced GM who says, "I need a stress check from you."

What constitutes me doing a good job, or a bad job, of this?</blockquote>\nIn my opinion, David, there's no such thing as a "bad job." <br/><br/>Bear in mind that I always start the movie by describing the opening credits and the scene that runs behind them. This scene -- I think it's called the teaser, in movie parlance, but I'm not certain of that -- serves two purposes. First, it establishes the theme for the movie by introducing or foreshadowing some of the major elements. Second, it serves as an example of the kind of descriptions that the players will be able to use when they're in the spotlight.<br/><br/>Now, if a player really grasps the movie analogy, that's great. You can spot those folks quickly: Their scenes will start with descriptions like "The shot opens with a close-up of the bell over the door -- and it's a real brass bell, not something electronic. As the door opens, it jostles the bell. The camera tilts down to show me entering the room."<br/><br/>A player who doesn't grasp the movie analogy will say, "I enter the room." That's not wrong. I wouldn't criticize a player for doing that. Sometimes I'll ask a question like, "What does your facial expression tell the audience?" to try to help loosen the player up or because the player's description could be taken in any of several ways. But it's not uncommon for a player to have to play more than one game with me before the full power of the movie analogy sinks in. <br/><br/>The most common "correction" I'll give, if you want to call it that, occurs when a player asks me a question, like "Is the window open or closed?" My usual answer is, "You tell me." If the player has something cool in mind, the last thing I want to do is squash it by telling him or her that the window is in the wrong position.<br/><br/>When a character is in the spotlight, the player has full control over what he or she wants the shot to convey. There's really no wrong way to do it. <br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_339925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339925/#Comment_339925" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T01:01:45+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  1:01AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2011 3:03AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>My manipulative psychodrama sensor is pinging. Obviously I wasn't there but it seems really strange that the same emotional state gets reached over and over again.</blockquote>Nothing strange about it. It is a natural development in role-playing games; with a great method and a skilled GM you may go there with your game, regularly. It is based on the fact that people are quite similar. If we are given the chance to engage in an emotional theme, and it is presented with care, most of us will. Some themes will make us smile or laugh, while other themes will make us cry. Having a role-playing game do this to us is as natural as having a movie doing it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The way control worked in the game was a rollercoaster ride. You had a lot of control then no control then a lot of control then no control. You could frame a scene and then all of a sudden you had no control. There were times you roll skills, many times you automatically succeeded, and many times you automatically failed. You had power then no power.</blockquote>This mirrors my experience too. Working with rpg-methods within the classical paradigm (GM and players), and steadily aiming for deeply engaging drama, I've seen that the amount of control the player have over his character must vary. No man is an island, and so all men must be susceptible to outside influences. Hanlding full control to the players all the time, makes it harder for them to identify with the character. As the character loose control the player looses it too, and thus he/she is invited to walk in those strange shoes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite>Because the game mechanics are both lightweight and infrequently invoked, the players can on focus making a good movie rather than making a good die roll.</blockquote>That's an important premise for this kind of game-play. The mechanics are one of two main parts of the game-method, and should be kept light to keep room for the other main part of the method; <i>the dialogue techniques</i>. Volume, pacing and inviting leadership is strong elements in the techniques. Todd seems to be having those in abundance.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite>None of the scenes have a predetermined ending, but every scene has a purpose (find the clue, talk with Bob, foreshadow the storm, whatever), because I hate scenes where the players have no idea what to do. There\u2019s something or someone that<i>will</i>interact with the characters in each scene. When I feel the audience has seen enough, I cut to the next scene.</blockquote>Great to read this, Todd! I totally agree with you.<br/><br/>My advice when lecturing GMs: <i>Focus on the scene at hand. Go there with the players, and put their characters in the center of action, or reaction. Frame it, open it for interaction, and feed it. And try to finish it on an energy peak. The scene should be: framed - fed - finished. Keep focus! Vary the pace!</i>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite> I believe that everyone understands movies. Even if you don\u2019t know what a jump cut is, everybody knows, through constant exposure to the medium, how movies are supposed to work. Once they get started, players quickly figure out how to tell the story in terms of \u201cwhat the audience sees\u201d rather than \u201cwhat I do.\u201d </blockquote>I do not use the movie analogy myself, but I find that having players take to the cut-and-jump techniques is farily simple, after a while. It takes longer with experienced players (them having learned other ways of doing it), and is easy with new players (they really listening in on what I say, and doing exactly that). We take turns framing scenes, and may jump minutes or years ahead from scene to scene, all as it suits our game. Doing this is part of the new method in my game <i>Fabula</i> (standard fantasy, published 1999, Norwegian), so it is done by all GMs of the game. And they all get results with it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite> the things that I think keep the players involved are:<br/><br/>Sympathetic characters that feel like real people, with real relationships and real problems.<br/>An engaging story that\u2019s internally consistent (because plot holes drive me nuts).<br/>Every scene has a purpose and something that will interact with the characters or that the characters can interact with.<br/>Aggressive control of pacing.<br/>Milking the movie analogy for all that it\u2019s worth.</blockquote>Good list!<br/><br/>I have led a lot of role-playing games that has made players experience strong emotions in symphony with their characters. It is not what I do on a weekly basis. Most games I lead are easy-going. All of them have traces of the emotional engagement you find in deeply moving games, but with less intensity. Still: I do try to create the deeply moving interaction on a regular basis. <br/><br/>Last week I had a table of 6 players cry (and so did I), when a baby boy was found next to his dead mother. The tears came when the aunt of the boy picked him up, and recognized him as the child of her sister. It was easy for me, as a GM, to let the emotions flow from there on, and easy for the players to do likewise. We made it into a moment of shared beauty and love, even if it was a tragic moment.<br/><br/>We relate to such situations; the words <i>mother, aunt, father, sister, brother</i> and so forth, is full of emotional power. By tapping into that power our interaction may grow into beautiful experiences. That's when we learn the most from our games.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing, Todd! I have really enjoyed reading this. It mirrors the things I do, and my GMs do, and feels like a very natural thing to do, when heavy mechanics don't burden you no more. I believe we are moving into the realm of "less is more". My gaming is about having simple game-elements combine with the players intuition, to make complex drama. I suspect your gaming is there too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339954/#Comment_339954" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T08:50:45+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  8:50AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2011 8:53AM by Emeraude.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite><br/><br/>I absolutely agree with being up front about what the movie's about. But what if a sensitive thing is a secondary (or teriary, even) element of the adventure? For example, I've sketched out next year's UA adventure, and the description will carry a warning similar to the following: "A real-world hate group is a small but signficant element of this adventure. Through their characters, players will be exposed to some of this hate group's rhetoric."<br/><br/>But if one of the player characters in this adventure has something sensitive in his background -- physical abuse, for example -- would you also reveal that to all the players at the start of the game? I confess to being torn on this.</blockquote>\nPersonally, I'd warn about anything which I believe might upset people. Just recently, a friend of mine ran into a very bad episode trying to run John Wick's second Curse of the Yellow Sign entry. Turns out one the player had lost a friend due to a drugs situation uncomfortably similar to one of the subplot in the scenario. I don't have details, but as far as I understand, things got ugly.<br/><br/><br/>I've personally come to the conclusion that the withholding of information is never a good thing. So I try to make things as transparent as possible.<br/><br/>That game about racism I talked about was made after I read an incredible Malherbe text in which he describes beasts in a field... only to have you realize at the last line it's humans he's been talking about, presenting you with the squalid living conditions of the peasantry of his time. From that trick I designed a Cthulhu game where players got in the role of gentry slave owners, right before those rebelled.<br/><br/>Only I ever described the slaves as I would beasts of burden, never even hinting at them being humans.<br/><br/>When I saw the  first player coming to the realization that the "mysterious unaccountable events" which had been occurring on the property had one simple explanation,  just as I thought the payoff was coming he burst into anger.<br/><br/>He was right of course, I had built the whole game on a cheap manipulative trick, and shouldn't have.<br/><br/>And at first, I thought it meant that particular scenario was just not meant to be played, as if the trick was all there was to it. But some years down the line, I replayed it with another group, and I just warned from the start: "This game is going to be about racism. *You* are going to play the racists. Slaves will be abjectly objectified." One player opted out. All those who stayed thought it was an incredible experience.<br/><br/>One thing I've come to understand is that the warning's purpose is twofold. Of course, it allows people who feels like it to opt out. But what it also does is draw the Huisingan magic circle for those who  chose to stay. It makes them willing to have those things happen, and willing to make them happen.<br/><br/>All that to say that, well yes, personally, I would warn players about the physical abuse. And I personally think the game would be better for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339961/#Comment_339961" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T09:22:44+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  9:22AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2011 9:28AM by David_Berg.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Todd,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite>Now, if a player really grasps the movie analogy, that's great. You can spot those folks quickly: Their scenes will start with descriptions like "The shot opens with a close-up of the bell over the door -- and it's a real brass bell, not something electronic. As the door opens, it jostles the bell. The camera tilts down to show me entering the room."<br/><br/>A player who doesn't grasp the movie analogy will say, "I enter the room." That's not wrong. I wouldn't criticize a player for doing that. Sometimes I'll ask a question like, "What does your facial expression tell the audience?" to try to help loosen the player up or because the player's description could be taken in any of several ways. But it's not uncommon for a player to have to play more than one game with me before the full power of the movie analogy sinks in.</blockquote>\nHuh.  Well, it doesn't seem productive to <i>criticize</i> a player for bland narration, but I would <i>absolutely</i> say that's doing a bad job.  And I think your question about facial expression implies that you agree that there's a better way to play it.<br/><br/>Contributing fictional details is important in this kind of play.  And I think your example is no accident: contributing fictional details that <i>communicate character emotion</i> is <i>especially</i> important in this kind of play.  Agreed?<br/><br/>I realize now that I shouldn't have asked about "when I'm in the spotlight".  The more telling case is when the GM is narrating, and hits me with something to react to.  I assume that, as above, it is important that I react in a way that engages the audience via the medium of the fiction.  Vivid description, emotional tone of voice for in-character speech, etc.<br/><br/>Is all this correct?<br/><br/>Here's why I'm asking.  I have a lot of friends who are averse to trying this play style, and yet, from what I know of their tastes, they would love it <i>if only they knew what their role was.</i>  I don't mean in terms of rolling dice or taking turns or having one character in a GMed game.  I mean, "What am I permitted and required to do that <i>other people at the table will care about?</i>"  <br/><br/>In Play Style A, I bring the awesome (and am recognized for it) by authoring clever plot twists.  In Play Style B,  I bring the awesome (and am recognized for it) by seeking out moral quandaries and making bold choices to address them.  In your Unknown Armies game, how do I bring the awesome?<br/><br/>If I could tell my friends, "Do <i>this</i>, and do it well, and the other players and GM will appreciate it," then I believe they would be much more open to trying games like your UA game, and much more successful at them.  This style of play does not give them the tools and agency they're used to, so I want to be very clear with them on what agency they <i>do</i> have.<br/><br/>"If you are good at / enjoy X, you will kick ass at this game!"  It's something most of us want to know for a new board game before we try it, and I think new RPG play styles are no different.<br/><br/>So, Todd, do you think we've identified that element of player performance as well as we can for your UA game?  Or are there other things that a player can and should do to enhance the play experience (and be appreciated for doing such)?<br/><br/>Sorry for the slew of questions!  I'm just pretty excited right now about removing what I see as a significant barrier to more people enjoying playing this way.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339966/#Comment_339966" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T09:37:49+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  9:37AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just adding a different voice to the discussion.<br/><br/>I have never cried during a game and I have no desire to. I don't trust anyone (at least in gaming) with the ability to touch those parts of my personality and my life. I don't play games to explore the dark side of humanity or my own personal issues. I play to have fun, to tell fun stories, and to socialize. <br/><br/>If I sat down with this GM and got his spiel on the rules of the session and the likelyhood of people crying, I would politely excuse myself from the table and the game. It holds zero interest for me. <br/><br/>That might seemed clipped and I don't really mean it to be, but it is exactly how I feel. I really think my gaming agenda differs greatly from a lot of the other people on these boards. Of course, I also don't watch movies that evoke that kind of reponse either, so it is just something about the way I'm wired. <br/><br/>Having said that, it's been an interesting thread, and I was curious about some of the techniques the GM used. Overall, though, the discussion has just convinced me it's nothing I'd want to be part of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340036/#Comment_340036" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T13:46:43+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  1:46PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is fascinating.

I suspect this is where the 'paternal' feel is coming from.  When someone breaks the rules he's set forth, he calls them on it (rather than just letting the game take on, say, a goofy vibe), and soon everyone can trust that, yes, this game is actually going to happen like this, so it's worth putting some energy into it.<br/><br/>The other thing is the lack of OOC emotional outlets.

Although you may not use the movie analogy, the idea of cutting directly to the next important thing (scene), no matter how much later it may occur in the movie\u2019s chronology, is a standard practice in filmmaking. So it sounds as if we\u2019re doing pretty much the same things -- and getting pretty much the same result.<br/><br/>Emeraude: Your advice is excellent. You\u2019re right; it\u2019s potentially destructive (to relationships, to someone\u2019s self-esteem, to a GM\u2019s reputation) to risk hurting someone by tossing an emotional grenade into the lap of someone who may be vulnerable. To grenades. OK, bad analogy. But I take to heart what you\u2019re saying.<br/><br/>Merb101: I fully respect your position. I wouldn\u2019t warn players about the content of a game if I didn\u2019t support their option to bow out. No harm, no foul.<br/><br/>Fuseboy: One of the reasons I rarely play RPGs at conventions is because so few GMs state their expectations up front. If you and I are players in a horror game, and you\u2019re trying to make it campy horror, while I try to make it serious horror, at least one of us is going to have less fun than he hoped for. Almost everything I do in a game, including gently but firmly enforcing my expectations, is born of a bad experience I had as a player. After each time, I swore the oath that one frequently hears from the owners of pets and children: \u201c<i>Mine</i> will be different!\u201d<br/><br/>Nathan: You\u2019re absolutely correct. \u201cThe Haunting of Devon Court\u201d is the only scenario (of 50+) in which players have consistently cried. My Unknown Armies adventures are more emotional than any other games I run, but even so, the players don\u2019t usually have any problem remaining emotionally detached from their characters. Devon Court is a thing all its own.<br/><br/>Can you elaborate on what you mean by \u201ccatch and release\u201d? <br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340097/#Comment_340097" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T19:18:06+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  7:18PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2011 7:21PM by Will_GM_for_Food.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Huh.

But it's unquestionably true that some people add more to the movie than others. Sometimes it takes more than one exposure to me for a player to understand what power I've handed him, so I try to be patient with everyone.\n<blockquote>Contributing fictional details is important in this kind of play.

What a player does when the GM is narrating is important to me as feedback, but I'm more concerned about what the player does when he's on camera to make ours a better movie. What follows is a list of concepts that I want a player to grasp, and some sample behaviors for each concept. And these are things I ask for, no matter what kind of RPG I'm running.<br/><br/><b>Capture the magic of the medium.</b> Use the movie analogy to tell your story in ways that you can\u2019t in other media. For example, use:\n<ul><li><i>Cut scenes.</i> Narrate a scene that only the audience can see. Perhaps it\u2019s your character\u2019s flashback. Or maybe a scene that you envision, that your character doesn\u2019t even know about.<br/></li><li><i>Camera tricks.</i> I once started an adventure with a cut scene of the main villain doing something evil. But in the entire cut scene, the villain had his back to the camera. So when the PCs finally met him later in the adventure, they didn\u2019t know who he was, even though their players could visualize exactly what he had done at the start of the movie. Players are encouraged to use similar tricks when they narrate a scene.<br/></li><li><i>Suspense.</i> Your character looks into the box and the audience sees the look of awe on her face. She closes the box without showing the camera what\u2019s inside. The audience wants to know <i>what is it</i>?</li></ul>\n<b>Focus!</b> Don\u2019t use my expensive film on something the audience doesn\u2019t have to see. \n<ul><li>Understand what can be done off camera. The audience doesn't need to see <i>everything</i>.<br/></li><li>Every frame of the movie should work toward conveying something important. Sure, there can be a scene of your character and my character just talking. But what do you want that conversation to convey the audience?</li></ul>\n<b>Give the audience a reason to keep watching.</b>\n<ul><li>In drama, the audience should cringe when your character is presented with difficult choices. <br/></li><li>In pulp, the audience should gasp when your character is in danger.<br/></li><li>In cyberpunk, the audience should wonder who you can trust. <br/></li><li>Don\u2019t make the GM do all the work. You can help make these things happen by coming up with some of the situations that make the audience care about your character.</li></ul>\n<b>It\u2019s all about the audience!</b>\n<ul><li>You have a cool secret on your character sheet? Great. You\u2019re the only one who knows about it. How are you going to let the audience find out about it?<br/></li><li>Your character has used a gun to settle his last three conflicts?

The more telling case is when the GM is narrating, and hits me with something to react to.  I assume that, as above, it is important that I react in a way that engages the audience via the medium of the fiction.  Vivid description, emotional tone of voice for in-character speech, etc.</blockquote>\nContributing fictional details is exactly what I'm looking for. What a player does when the GM is narrating is important to me as feedback, but I'm more concerned about what the player does when he's on camera to make ours a better movie.<br/><br/>Argh, sorry, I was unclear!  I didn't mean "What do the players do while the GM's mouth is moving?"  I meant, "What do the players do when given a moment to respond, but <i>not</i> given the full <i>you're in charge</i> opportunity from the GM?"<br/><br/>Anyway, what I really want to know now is <b>which</b> of the things on your list (the one you just posted) I get to do <b>how frequently</b>.<br/><br/>I am surprised by the prominence in your list of directorial decisions, as I thought each player would get very few opportunities to make those.  <br/><br/>Player spotlight scenes are [total scenes] minus [GM-steered scenes] divided by [number of players], right?  That sounds like a tiny fraction of the total play time.<br/><br/>Do players get to narrate cuts, flashbacks, character-revealing content, etc. when they <i>haven't</i> been explicitly handed a spotlight scene?<br/><br/>If not, I would assume that players have much more frequent opportunities to <i>make the audience cringe or gasp</i>, via a quick action or line of dialogue.  Is that accurate?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David<br/><br/>P.S.  I love your list, and, for what it's worth, I look for similar things across many games too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14899/4-out-of-7-cried" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14899/4-out-of-7-cried" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14899/4-out-of-7-cried/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14899/4-out-of-7-cried/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14899/4-out-of-7-cried/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14899%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14899%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>4 out of 7 cried - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14899/4-out-of-7-cried/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="4 out of 7 cried - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14899/4-out-of-7-cried/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="All quotes are from David's post above.

I was unclear! I didn't mean "What do the players do while the GM's mouth is moving?" I meant, "What do the players do when given a moment to respond, but<i>not</i>given the full<i>you're in charge</i>opportunity from the GM?"</blockquote>\nAh, now I think I understand why we're struggling a bit with this discussion. Our wires are crossed.<br/><br/>The only time I take control of a character is when that character fails a stress check. Under all other circumstances, the player is free, and encouraged, to be the director of his own shot or scene.\n<blockquote>Anyway, what I really want to know now is<b>which</b>of the things on your list (the one you just posted) I get to do<b>how frequently</b>.</blockquote>\nWhenever you're on camera and I don't have control of your character because he failed a stress check. That's why I don't ask a player, "What do you do?" I always ask, "What does the audience see?" That's your queue to direct.<br/><br/>Things get a little challenging in ensemble shots, because it can be hard to identify the owner of the scene. But if you think about it, rarely in a movie do you really see everyone on camera at the same time. The camera usually bounces from character to character, so each character owns his shot, even if he doesn't own the whole scene.<br/><br/>Many times, a simple shot is a perfectly efffective shot, so players tend to be sparing with the kinds of techniques I described in my list. But they're actually available to the player any time he's on camera. If I or another player have a different technique in mind, we'll briefly discuss our ideas, figure out which we like best, and reshoot the scene if necessary.\n<blockquote>Player spotlight scenes are [total scenes] minus [GM-steered scenes] divided by [number of players], right? That sounds like a tiny fraction of the total play time.</blockquote>\nI don't think it's as small as you might imagine. I only start each scene. After that, I jump in to play an NPC, describe an event that occurs, or call for a stress check based on something I heard or saw. If none of those things are happening, I stay in the background.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's still a traditional RPG, in that the GM probably talks about as much as all the players combined. The actual amount that I talk depends upon whether the scenario was designed to be plot-heavy or role-playing heavy. I'm embarrassed to admit that most of my scenarios are the former because I like a robust story. But any time I find myself frequently stepping on role-playing, the following year is likely to have a role-playing-heavy scenario.\n<blockquote>Do players get to narrate cuts, flashbacks, character-revealing content, etc. when they <i>haven't</i> been explicitly handed a spotlight scene?<br/><br/>If not, I would assume that players have much more frequent opportunities to <i>make the audience cringe or gasp</i>, via a quick action or line of dialogue. Is that accurate?</blockquote>\nYes, if I'm the owner of the scene, players can take the spotlight from me and insert content. If another player owns the scene, that player has veto power. If the nonspotlight player wants to add a significant amount of content or something that will have a very high impact,  and it occurs during someone else's shot or scene, I often ask the nonspotlight player to get my or the spotlight player's attention first because whoever's directing may be on a roll and want to control the timing of when the new content appears on screen. But entering or leaving a scene, saying something in character, dictating the actions or words of a minor NPC -- things of that magnitude are available to all the players at all times. Except when they're under the effect of a failed stress check, that is.\n<blockquote>P.S. I love your list, and, for what it's worth, I look for similar things across many games too.</blockquote>\nThanks very much, David. In my pulp games, I give <i>huge</i> amounts of directorial authority -- far more than the examples above. Pulp lends itself well to that sort of thing.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340327/#Comment_340327" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T09:55:16+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  9:55AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

So if in one scene, your character runs into a his arch-enemy the bully, and I call for a skill check when you try to get away and the roll fails, your character is in a bad way unless somebody comes to your aid. <br/><br/>If you're a disciplined player, you'll use your directorial authority to most effectively elicit sympathy from the audience while your character gets the snot beaten out of him, rather than to try to engineer a miraculous escape. In the meantime, if another player has already sent his his character to come to your rescue, I have no reason to prevent that from happening -- but I'll control the timing of when the rescuer shows up. So yeah, I guess I do sometimes limit the players' directorial power for a specific effect. Perhaps that's what John was talking about.<br/><br/>Hmm. I'm coming to the inescapable conclusion that there are a lot of things that I do unconsciously when I'm GMing. It's entirely possible that all of this analysis I've been offering is just hokum, based on a flawed perception of how I think I run a game. <br/><br/>Anyway, like many other GMing techniques, the success of this one is strongly influenced by the willingness of the players to tell a moving story, rather than a story in which their characters overcome all adversity without breaking a sweat. I think that by reinforcing the tone of the game, I help make it clear what types of things the audience should expect to happen to the characters. This, in turn, makes it easier for the players to allow such things to happen.<br/><br/>Oh, and to answer your question, I'll call for a stress check as close to the stressor event as I can. Often, that's immediately after the stressor. But if a failed stress check would interrupt the flow of the scene and not significantly add to the story, I'll usually delay the check until the end of the shot or the scene. For example, if I can tell a scene will have several stressful interchanges in it, I'll usually call for one stress check at the end, to kind of cover the scene as a whole. That's what I would do in the scene you described above, where you're trying to build up to something.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340406/#Comment_340406" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T22:27:01+00:00" title="August 24, 2011 10:27PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent!  Let me see if I can synthesize this.  Players do more expressing of their character than they do meaningful authoring of anything outside their character (they can't control what NPCs do, right?), but their tools for expressing their character are extensive.  Method acting is cool, but so is describing camera movement, inserting flashbacks or cuts, and introducing content that helps you get at what you're expressing.<br/><br/>The plot, the backstory, the world logic, the NPCs, the other PCs -- none of these are up for grabs.  What my character does in the midst of a stress response isn't either.  My character's screen time is dictated by the GM.  But within the province of my non-stress-crazed character, I have a lot of flexibility and options for how to show them off when they're on screen.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the most important thing for me to do in play is to express my character in the ways important to the audience of this movie.  This audience isn't interested in how badass, clever and effective my character is, so it's a waste of my time and energy to problem-solve on their behalf.  What the audience wants to see is how the unfolding plot affects them.  Whatever cinematic tools are best for communicating that should be invoked with gusto.<br/><br/>Does that sound accurate?  I may still be biasing this toward my initial expectations, so don't hesitate to correct me!  But your distinction between changing the <i>story</i> vs changing the <i>telling</i>, and your example about evoking sympathy during a beating rather than avoid a beating, are perfectly in line with my first inklings.<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David<br/><br/>P.S.

I think equally important is the passive, or should I say <i>receptive</i> side.  Caring about the plot is pretty key, right?  "What's going to happen next?  What old questions will it answer; what new ones will it pose?  What's the ultimate reason why all this is going on?  How will this all come to a point of resolution?"  (And the the more active, "When the resolution comes, will I be able to sway it?")  The players need to get into the story, to invest in following its twists and turns.<br/><br/>Your skill as a storyteller may make this natural and easy, Todd, but it's still important to me to note it.  If a given player has no interest in using their convention time to be audience to someone else's story, I think this probably isn't the game for them.  Right?<br/><br/>So, to sum up: it's vital to express your character, it's vital to absorb and care about the GM's story.  It's probably also important to invest as audience in the other players' expressions of their characters.  Hmm.  For players, that may about cover it!<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>John, I'd be happy to hear your take too.<br/><br/>I think I could effectively pitch this to players...  Todd, I get the sense that you're good at eliciting buy-in even from people who didn't fully know what they were getting into, so this may not concern you too much.  I think it could be a big help to a lot of other groups and GMs, though, so I appreciate you working on it with me!<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_340682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340682/#Comment_340682" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T21:28:39+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  9:28PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>If a given player has no interest in using their convention time to be audience to someone else's story, I think this probably isn't the game for them.</blockquote>I believe any role-playing game is better for having its players recognize that the "story" is something they share in creating, and that sharing is dependent on them all taking part in, or observing, the scenes.<br/><br/>It's not like you are an audience to the scenes of others; you are more like the script writer looking at one scene for inspiration and possibilities in the next.

I don't think I've cried before during any tabletop rpg, but I rarely cry during movies, and the few times I have have been right after break ups. Big fights or break ups with people I love are pretty much the only time I cry, really. I have however cried from online roleplaying but I think that was largely due to some problems I've had with that medium. The times I've been brought to tears all involved always IC muck style rpgs where something in the story either created a huge rift between a character my pc was close to or just plain killed one of us off. Part of what hit me hard was the tragedy in the story but another big part would be realizing that my only connection to this person I enjoyed playing with was through the game, so by losing the in character relationship our actual relationship was effectively cut off, making it difficult to seperate my character's feelings of loss from my own. I've been hit pretty hard by finding out someone I wanted to play with but didn't know yet had their character killed off or otherwise removed from play due to a traumatic event too. I think the frustration of trying to keep up with people who were online a lot more than me was sometimes part of it, where between two of my sessions my character's best friend or whatever went through a whole story arc that led to cutting them off from whatever plot or character development I had been working towards with them. Another part of it must also be that I have privacy in an online situation where in person I don't want to make everyone else uncomfortable, but those added elements coming together seemed essential to pushing me far enough to cry.<br/><br/>By the same token similar situations hit me hard in tabletop games, but usually only in longform games where I've had time to grow attatched to characters and at worse I tear up. A random and meaningless, nonconsentual PC character death often bothers me a lot too, as a similar combination of the in game tragedy, not being able to continue to play scenes between my character and theirs anymore, and the player of the character who died arbitrarily (unfairly in my mind) losing their agency to impact the fiction. Probably another reason that bothers me is my first experience with roleplaying, where the GM quickly killed me and my friends characters off within a few minutes after I failed a dex check to not spill my beer on an overpowered NPC.<br/><br/>Part of me is jealous of people who talk about crying in tabletop games, partly because I wish I was that good of a method actor, and partly because I wish I had the courage to allow myself to express emotions that openly. The other part of me is glad that it's easy for me to seperate my feelings from the fiction for the most part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436174/#Comment_436174" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T12:25:23+00:00" title="August  1, 2014 12:25PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've cried dysfunctionally five or six times (because of problems with the group or with values or limits), but \u201cfunctionally\u201d (e.g. the game produced an intended, valuable emotional response) like somewhere between three to five times. Once recently in a GM-less AMAZING game with some people who I hope read Story-Games. We played band members who lived together and had strong emotions about everything. The band\u2019s name was \u201cOh, Coco\u201d. For those who were in that game, get back into my life and let\u2019s play some more games!<br/><br/>I\u2019ve also cried over character death combined with rude players \u2014 not sure which category that falls into. It is \u201cfunctional\u201d that the game created such a bond to the character that I missed it and dreamt about levels yet to come. But it was dysfunctional in that the tense situation was aggravated by a tasteless player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436200/#Comment_436200" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T14:11:16+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  2:11PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly, my first thought when I read the original post was "this is unusual???", but then I realised I've been totally spoiled by Fastaval.<br/>That's not to say every game I've run there has resulted in tears, (the writers of several lighthearted comedies would likely be rather disappointed if they had) but every year, out of the 8-10 games I run, at least two will result in tears.
