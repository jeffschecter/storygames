I'm still working that out.  So far I've only played with Robin, though once I'm done with my beginning of the day web stuffs, I think I'll try Rose (planning on working my way through the girls from youngest to oldest).<br/><br/>One thing that's interesting to me so far (and which possibly makes it an odd thing to discuss on Story Games) is that there's no real story.  Or at least not an explicit one.  Everything is so goddamn surreal and symbolic that it's almost completely up to the player to assemble any story there might be in his or her imagination.  I mean, for my part, I'm fairly convinced that absolutely nothing in the game is literal or real.  The whole thing seems to be a metaphor for something (some people seem to think that something is probably "Life" and I'm not sure I disagree).<br/><br/>The game is Slow.  This shouldn't be a surprise, given that the designers specifically call it a Slow Game (in caps like that too, though I've never heard that term applied to anything else before.  maybe they coined it?  i don't know.).  This can be kind of frustrating sometimes (but I think that's mostly due to what I'm used to with games) but when I'm able to just chill out and get into the experience, it's also kind of cool.<br/><br/>The game does an absolutely fucking <b>fantastic</b> job with atmosphere, in my opinion.  My favorite example of this is what happens if you run while in the woods.  Normally the camera sits behind your girl.  You can see her whole body and straight in front of her.  If you run, the camera pulls back and up, meaning that you can barely see in front of her at all, but mostly are seeing what's behind her.  Plus, as you continue to run, the screen darkens with weird patterns and you start to hear the girl's heartbeat.  It does a great job of capturing the feeling of running headlong from some unseen predator, heedless of what you might be running <i>toward.</i><br/><br/>I first played it on Thursday, I think.  I did a safe run with Robin and followed The Rule.  I stayed on the path, went right to Grandma's house.  And it still creeped me the hell out.  The next day I did a "successful" run with Robin, though it took me two tries (be warned that even if you save the game in the forest, when you start again you'll start from the red room.  it'll save the items you found, but you can't pick up exactly where you left off).  I've found that, unlike many more traditional video games that I like, I'm not feeling compelled to keeping playing this until I'm done with it.  So I've been liking to fire it up, play it for like an hour, then leave it and come back the next day or later on.  That might just be me, though.<br/><br/>So, that's what I think so far.<br/>I'd like to hear your thoughts, Andy, once you've played it.  I may have more to say once I've been through it with another girl or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oreso" title="oreso"><img alt="oreso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oreso">oreso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199303/#Comment_199303" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T11:07:43+00:00" title="March 29, 2009 11:07AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.
