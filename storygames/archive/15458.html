The priorities here:<br/>1) main object (here, a dagger) needs to pop, boom, right away<br/>2) card type needs to be obvious (in this case, a Treasure Card, as indicated by the title plate, background, and gold coins at edges)<br/>3) rules need to be easy to read for a player with the card on the table right in front of them<br/>4) overall game aesthetic is a combo of (a) old-timey and (b) fun &amp; exciting<br/><br/>How do you all think these are working along those lines?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.shrikedesign.com/treasure-demo1.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.shrikedesign.com/treasure-demo2.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/>Other thoughts also welcome.<br/><br/>The game itself is a quick-to-learn 2-player tactical game.

What size are you printing the cards? I'll need to print out an example card to know how well the font style, size, leading, and kerning work.<br/><br/>2. Is the example rules text above the longest it will ever be? If not, how long is the longest rules text in the game? Right now the designated space looks like it can accommodate 50 characters depending on word length. Is the longest rules text longer than 50 characters? If yes, would the rules text background expand to fit more? How would that work?<br/><br/>This might interest you:<br/>- <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/5-graphic-design-and-typography-tips.html" rel="nofollow">5 Graphic Design &amp; Typography Tips For Your Card Game</a><br/>- <a href="http://illuminatinggames.blogspot.com/2011/11/communication-design-in-boardgames.html" rel="nofollow">Communication Design in Boardgames</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350510/#Comment_350510" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T05:58:35+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  5:58AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I've played Ghost Pirates and it's fun!

Primarily, everything has the same weight, so the eye doesn't know where to go.  That brown background has an overwhelming range of contrast in comparison to the other visuals.  Is that wood table?  Brown sky?  Drop the contrast on it; maybe try blurring it. Your key element, the Dagger, doesn't seem to have a white.  In fact it looks like nothing has a white.  The gold coins are also sort of the same value as the "white" fields for the text blocks.  If you drop the value on the brown and on the coins you'll have better read for the text and image.  love them or hate them, drop shadows might be your friend here, but sparingly.<br/><br/>Secondly, type.  the decorative typeface works well for the field at top but is mostly not readable below.  The sheaf of papers strewn under the type could be extended across the width of the bottom of the card which would give you more room.  I would try a second typeface for the rules.  Specifically a sans-serif that was designed to be read at a small point size.<br/><br/>Most importantly, it looks like a fun project.  Have fun with it.  Oh, and move back to New York soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350530/#Comment_350530" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T09:19:21+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  9:19AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything Double King said!<br/><br/>Are the above backgrounds standard to each card or card type? <br/><br/>There are several online color scheme generators to help choose complimentary and contrasting colors to differentiate background and foreground elements:<br/><br/>- <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/" rel="nofollow">http://colorschemedesigner.com/</a><br/>- <a href="http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html</a><br/>- <a href="http://www.colorsontheweb.com/colorwizard.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.colorsontheweb.com/colorwizard.asp</a><br/>- <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/#create/fromacolor" rel="nofollow">http://kuler.adobe.com/#create/fromacolor</a><br/><br/>I like <b>colorschemedesigner</b> because it gives you the option to view your color schemes from the perspective of different forms of color blindness (click Colorblind on the top right).<br/><br/>But <b>kuler.adobe</b> lets you choose color schemes from sampling images. <br/><br/>Some of these tools only give you hex or RGB color values but you can use Photoshop to convert to CMYK.

Holy shit.  Great stuff, guys!<br/><br/>I've been unsure how much tweaking/dissolving/destroying the artist's <b>background</b> was kosher, but it sounds like Tim's down, so, sweet.  I hated the way it was fighting the other card elements too.  Killing the contrast and adding texture: definitely.  Darkening is less good; I had some earlier demos that were deemed too gloomy.<br/><br/>Eric, great call on the <b>whites</b>.  I actually quite like yours; what technique did you use for that?<br/><br/>As for <b>bottom text</b>, more real estate is fine, larger type is fine, more tracking/leading is fine... but I'd like to avoid cold sans-serifs if at all possible.  <br/><br/>As for <b>text size</b>, specifically:<br/><br/>I think that overly large text gives a kid-friendly, cartoony look to cards, and Tim has told me he'd rather not have that.  Readability is paramount, but beyond that, I'd rather keep it on the small side.  <br/><br/>As for readability, my experience with business cards has been that anything that's borderline too small to read on a screen has been easily readable when printed.  Accordingly, my original demos above would read just fine in print.

I'll have to get the final word from Tim on that.  <br/><br/>Thanks for the links!  <br/><br/>Kuler is my friend.  I'm not used to not being the artist, so I've been laying off certain things.  But ultimately, anything that helps the cards will be considered!<br/><br/>That color blindness thing is spiffy.  I actually often start my designs in black and white, though I didn't for this one.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I really pumped up the saturation and contrast on the nameplate and coins so they'll pop from across the table.</blockquote>Nice!  "The Treasure Cards are the orangey ones!" is a nice option too.  Didja recolor the nameplate with Curves, Levels, or just straight Hue?\n<blockquote>I felt like the background was still fighting with the treasure item, so I scaled it back even more (and added an old parchment texture and some foxing around the edges).</blockquote>Is that foxing simply some big black brushstrokes with 0% Hardness, drop shadows on off-screen elements, or something else?  <br/><br/>I'm torn on the darkened edges, honestly.  They help make the card look deep and all the foreground elements pop, but there's just a wee bit of a closed-in, viewport effect that I've been trying to avoid (thus the lack of borders).  Also, dark edges won't play well with the cards for the pirate ship, so I'm caught between deck consistency and card-type differentiation.\n<blockquote>I also gave the item and the coins a very slight outer glow, in darkish brown, set to soft light to pop them out even more.</blockquote>Excellent.  I'd tried some outer glows, but good call on the soft light and the brown.  Thanks, and thanks for explaining!\n<blockquote>And, since this is<i>Ghost</i>Pirates, I made an ectoplasmic blue version for good measure. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>Hey man, I'm all for sticking my little skull drawing in wherever I can!

That's the most important one to distinguish from the Treasure type.  I do have some more Treasure and Ship Deck cards that are getting close.  I'll post some more when they're ready.<br/><br/>Again, thanks, all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350635/#Comment_350635" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T22:16:42+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 10:16PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And it's funded!

I get the not liking dark.  A mixture of desaturation and adding some sort of noise effect should create enough separation between the main elements and the background.<br/><br/>- re whites: what technique?  just contrast and dotting the metal elements with a soft-edged brush in PS.<br/><br/>- i think i used Helvetica because it was there.  Harper's is more friendly (Gotham?).  It's an eternal debate between flavor and readability and legibility.  There are a bunch of humanist sans faces that aren't cold like the 60s/70s era faces (again Harper.)  But the more specialized you get into that the more expensive your budget.  Fancy type faces are generally designed as Display Fonts which means they aren't meant to be reproduced as body text.  I don't know that i'd try to match anything specifically to your display type; but if you want to go with a serif typeface for the info; maybe marry it to the body copy used in the rules book?  Or pick something mundane that won't draw attention to itself: Times, New Century etc. (cheap, readable and somewhat invisible.)<br/><br/>- designers like small type.  humans hate small type.  for the cards, i wouldn't recommend going below 11pt on anything.  Of course, this will vary some based on the nature of the type\u2013but you're going to want to be able to read it at arm's length or exposed in public space.  Your printer may not be able to get great blacks and/or the line screen might not be super fine which means that small type will become mushy.  Best to err on large and easy, your gamers will thank you.<br/><br/>-ps. no frayed scroll icons?  look at you bucking convention!<br/><br/>x<br/>e                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350645/#Comment_350645" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T23:49:51+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 11:49PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; you're going to want to be able to read it at arm's length or exposed in public space<br/><br/>Really, what you should just do is, like, print out a set of prototypes and try playing the game in a dimly lit restaurant &amp; bar.
