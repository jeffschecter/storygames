A character's play ends with death; but the character's<i>impact</i>does not, because during their lives, characters create artifacts, texts, and spells, as well as teach apprentices and ponder magical theory. So, "the character's story continues after death" in a sense.<br/><br/>I guess what I was getting at by cross-posting that here is something like "if a character makes real impact on a game-world (shared fiction) during life/play, then what are the possible implications on play of the dead character?"<br/><br/>I guess that's a little farther afield than what you had originally meant by this thread, but I think it's potentially valuable. If you play a "generational" game, like<i>Pendragon</i>, then in what sense are you playing a series of characters, and in what sense are you playing a "meme", mutating through generations? In games like that, ideas (spells, tomes, instructions; or in<i>Pendragon</i>, specific traits and tendencies) are transmitted between individual characters, forming a continuity.<br/><br/>Sorry for how sloppily-presented this idea is. It makes sense in my head.</blockquote>\nSo, what I'd like to discuss is how realistic this is. In a game where you play multiple characters who are inheriting traits, setting, or other trappings from each other, are you in some sense playing a meme? What mechanics would strengthen memetic play? Is it better to spell such play out explicitly, or just let it happen?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211500/#Comment_211500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T18:01:02+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  6:01PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the concept of playing a meme is a cool one. <br/><br/>As for mechanics, I think something like a Spirit of the Century style aspect that had to do with the meme and applied to all characters in that legacy would be cool. <br/>Although I think this sort of play can "just happen" as well, like if one of your characters goes out (not necessarily dying) in an awesome way and they inspire future play, but that sort of thing doesn't necessarily carry and mechanical bonus.<br/><br/>Man, I can't believe I got through that post without a single reference to internet memes.

How about a game where each player is a historian in some great city-state in the "future" who has studied one of the pillar virtues of the Utopia and they "narrate" the stories of the bearers of those virtues from the beginning of the world until the formation of their Utopia as kind of a "bragging rights" contest?<br/><br/>"As the Scholar of 'Defense of the Weak', I can say that the great hunter Fran-Lo was the first to take up the mantle of the Defender.

Each Age will bring a new group of meme-carriers and the ending result shapes the Utopia we imagine the tale-spinners in.  This had a shade of Judd K's SotC idea of adding aspects to the world.  Each Age, the hero will add some aspect based on what they do (assigned by the other players) that their service to the cause brought to society.  Slowly, you build the idea and the concept you embody - maybe with a pinch of a "revisionist history" destiny point mechanic ("you are wrong, Lang-Si, despite what was written by some sages, was not scarred in the fire, it was instead her scribe, Achel...").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211527/#Comment_211527" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T19:45:18+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  7:45PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>Ah, I assumed each character took up the same cause as the previous one.

So it could be something like your example, but it could be the same cause as well.

I like the idea of a whole campaign being nothing more than a retelling, with potential for "transcription error". I think it would be fun to create some kind of structure that exists at the start of a campaign and each session of play mutates that idea somehow, and each session is a generation. It would be exciting to see where the idea ends up. So if the first session began with "power corrupts", then at the end of the session, the players would weigh in on how that idea had been modified or embraced, and maybe after five or six generations, you end up with "power must remain in the hands of the wise"; and then five or six more turn the idea into "the wise cannot be trusted, unless they are checked by the mighty". Something like that.<br/><br/>It the original form, I was thinking of the "meme" in a less-specific way; in <i>Pendragon</i>, for example, you play a bloodline, which is not a meme per se, but within the context of the game, it is a concept which spans generations and can be seen to be a cultural entity that can be seen to replicate. Also in the sense that in <i>Pendragon</i> traits like "Hate Saxons" or "Piety" are literally inherited. Similarly in <i>Ars Magica</i>, the PCs are the residents of a Covenant and a Tribunal, and those bodies are made up of memetic ideas that can likewise be transformed as the Covenant (and its residents) age, and are passed to the next generation of apprentices.<br/><br/>I wonder in what way the memetic elements of "bloodline" or "Covenant" can be extracted mechanically for a "meme-playing game"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211618/#Comment_211618" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T09:30:37+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  9:30AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 9:30AM by Josh Roby.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>I do like the idea of playing a group of serial defenders of an idea as it travels thorugh time and mutates to something that stands as a golden pillar of some society.</blockquote>\n[self-pimping]<br/><br/>This is pretty much exactly what <a href="http://kallistipress.com/2009-03-04/agora-v302-beta-playtest-opens/" rel="nofollow">Agora: how shall we live?</a> is about.

You have four ideals, which are ideological statements used as traits, that define what you and your people believe; those ideals get slowly mangled through play, and when you hit endgame you're a different people than when you started.<br/><br/>[/self-pimping]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211630/#Comment_211630" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T10:30:38+00:00" title="June 11, 2009 10:30AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of literally playing a character who was influenced by your previous character.
