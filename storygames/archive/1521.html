                    I hear a lot about these zealots that (supposedly) make up the vast majority of people who use and study Forge-ish theory.  Apparently the zealots tell other people that they don't understand their own play, say that mainstream games have never reached an audience, and base their entire foundation of thought on the certainty that the last digit of Pi is 6.<br/><br/>Are there really that many idiots out there?  Or is it a self-perpetuating meme?<br/><br/>I have a theory that it's the latter:  Folks who don't understand theory, or who understand it and don't want to hear it, denigrate the entire exercise with a broad <i>ad hominem</i> argument.  They select (or, I suspect, <b>invent</b>) behavior of the most extreme kind, then widely disparage the entire endeavor of theory by pointing to that extreme behavior and saying "Theory is the realm of extremists."<br/><br/>Further, given how few of these extremists I see around (and they really do seem, to me, to be a dying sub-species) and how very many people use the "Theorists are crazy!" argument, I don't see how the numbers can work out in terms of all those people having been personally affronted by theory-nutjobs.  I believe that the idea of the theory-zealot has made the jump from being an accurate description of existing trends (like "Hey, if you're hiking watch out for mountain lions ... one of 'em damn near bit my hand off!") to being a self-reinforcing legend ("Hey, watch out for Big Foot!  I heard about a guy whose cousin's co-worker's fiance ran off with that hairy casanova!")                </div>

                            Who says that zealots are the vast majority?  I'm not sure I've heard that anywhere.<br/><br/>The zealots do exist, I've seen the whole "you don't understand what you enjoy in play" thing tons of times, but the fact that the zealots are vocal doesn't make them a  majority.  That said, it would be weird if there were no zealots, it's the internet, there are zealots for everything.<br/><br/>These idiots IMO are out there, that doesn't mean there's a lot of them.  But, pretty much by definition zealots shout louder, so if you get a dozen guys in a thread supportive of theory who think it's useful and one guy who somehow has self-identified with it then that one guy will probably generate more posts and definitely more offensive posts than the rest put together.<br/><br/>It's just an internet thing.  Put it in another context, if we're discussing movies then there will generally be quite a few guys who prefer indie film to mainstream - but it only takes one asshole to say that mainstream movies are for the slackjawed masses for all the indie film fans to get tarred by association.<br/><br/>That said, if you're referring to my posts in the other thread I was trying to talk about what I thought were self-defeating posting habits that I have seen used, I don't think I said they were how the majority of theorists posted.  I wasn't making any comment about the theory at all either way, good or bad, just about how one might undermine attempts to explain it.  My points in that thread were intended as constructive and were in no way hostile to theory or theorists.<br/><br/>I've been in threads where people have been told, in all seriousness, that they did not understand what they found fun.  In the last year as it happens.  It's partly why I no longer participate in theory threads in fact, I found nothing useful was being done because the moderate proponents got tired of being shouted down and the zealots were pointless to talk to.  I don't think the guys saying that are the majority, but they do turn up and it just gets too boring to continue.  The other reason I stopped participating in theory threads was to avoid being those guys for the theory proponents, since I am unpersuaded by the theories but they don't need to hear that every damn time either.<br/><br/>That said, I don't recall seeing anyone saying that theorists were crazy, so just as I missed those perhaps you've missed the ones where some folk went a bit too evangelical?                        </div>

You started an rpg.net thread on that, but I don't think anyone could point to anyone actually saying that either.<br/><br/>Seriously, where does anyone ever say that theorists don't play?  I've seen people say that not all theorists play, I can think of at least one regular theory poster that I'm pretty sure doesn't, but nobody that I know of is saying that theorists generally don't play.  It's a straw man.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Are there really that many idiots out there?  Or is it a self-perpetuating meme?</blockquote>
I hate to dwell too much on it, but I still see that it's clearly both. It is a self-perpetuating meme (Or Pundit-perpetuated, in his dark corners of the net).<br/><br/>It is a self-perpetuating meme. And yet, people who discuss theory regularly use techniques or ways of conversation (usually academic) that aren't compatible with something as informal as an online chat. Also, I used to be ambivalent on the matter, but more and more I'm thinking, "If you can not explain what you mean by TERM X or PROCESS Y in, say, 3-4 SIMPLE sentences, then there's a problem." (maybe with the explainer for not "really knowing it", or with the theory itself for being in such a vague state).<br/><br/>I see this a lot.<br/>1: "Actually, it sounds like a classic case of X".<br/>2: "What's X?"<br/>1: "Read these three threads over here, A B and C."<br/><br/>Sure, some theory builds upon other theory and all that, but in the end the theories or explanations or "what's wrong with X" or "what's awesome about Y" CAN, with effort, be summarized in a bite-sized knowledge pill, but for some crazy reason no one bothers to do so.<br/><br/>This in particular is offputting to "normal folks" who just want a simple term definition. <br/>1: "I don't know about X. Can someone tell me about it?"<br/>2: "Sure, there's a lot of good work done on that very topic in the following discussions: A, B, C. Also, it would help if you gave an example of what you THOUGHT was X, and I'll tell you if it was or not."<br/>1: "Uh... nevermind."<br/><br/>Person 1 *does* want to know about X. They just don't want to have a Masters' Level Thesis understanding of it. They want the Glossary Definition. Rarely is it given.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

The image will always get talked about. Always.<br/><br/>So if these zealots are a small minority, and nobody is claiming that they're important, why do they always get so much face-time?<br/><br/>For the same reason.<br/><br/>Let's say there are a dozen interested parties on the thread.  Two are pro-theory nerds who will argue that theory will help deworm your cat, two are anti-theory nerds who will argue that theorists are armchair gamers who hate people having fun.  The rest are either mildly pro or mildly unconvinced or haven't taken a view yet.<br/><br/>Who will post most?  Who will produce the heat and the light?  Four posters, the zealots on each side.  As they do so, they will piss off the moderate guys on each side who will therefore become more zealous themselves.<br/><br/>And then each group brings out a bunch of tired arguments that make no fucking sense at all.  Ron hates gamers, poster x doesn't understand his own fun, all that crap.  I really don't think I've seen the theorists don't game one anywhere much (though maybe I just haven't noticed it, it seems silly anyway as spending five minutes on the Forge would show the vast majority of them do), the zealot argument I suspect just hasn't registered with me.  But just as those who are seeking to explain theory sometimes use fuckwitted methods to do it so sometimes those who are trying to explain why they consider theory to be flawed use fuckwitted methods to do that.<br/><br/>Thing is, the thread here was about how people sometimes missell theory, I promise you I could just as easily list a load of things people do in challenging theory that are just as counterproductive.<br/><br/>That and the brain damage/child abuse thing really antagonised a lot of people, I think that single handedly screwed any chance of meaningful discussion for some time yet to come.

Actually, I see it a lot. People assume that theorists are ivory-tower academics who talk about theory and don't actually play games. Seriously, comments to this effect are EVERYWHERE at like RPGNet and the like.  Sadly, in a few cases (Jack Spencer, some other folks who lived in the Forge Theory forums and no where else) they were right. But in the majority, this is not true. And yet, the image remains.  I think it just has to do with a perception of ivory-tower academia in general, which people simply apply to people who treat RPG theory with academic discussion.<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>Also, Tony, IIRC the other day at RPGNet you were comapring someone's unwillingness to try X ("new gaming styles"? I forget) as the same thing as when your 5-year-old child says they don't like a kind of fruit they never have or whatever. <br/>Sure, it may be true in a sense, but the comparison that is seen by the audience is "Hey, this theory guy just compared "people who don't try theory" to "5-year-old children". What the fuck? This guy is a zealot of the worst kind!" There are other comparisons that could have been brought up, but comparisons like the above, while they look innocent, cause people to do a double-take. And of course folks like Kyle aka JimBob rubs his little weenie with glee as he jots your comparison down into his "anti-indie notebook", to be thrown into unrelated threads at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>When meaty word-fists are unleashed without thought of consequences, "enthusiasts" get labelled "zealots".<br/><br/>Edit:
<blockquote>That and the brain damage/child abuse thing really antagonised a lot of people, I think that single handedly screwed any chance of meaningful discussion for some time yet to come. Possibly for years.</blockquote>
Yeah. Again, see JimBob's gleeful weenie-rubbing as he trolls, snipes and tanks threads that are in an way remotely related to the Forge. He wouldn't have the ammo if we didn't give it to him.<br/><br/>Then again, not a lot of people pay attention to him anyway, but still he's like a "fly on honey", when we could have had "honey".                        </div>

Jack is the person I always think of in terms of theorists who don't game, and there were quite a few in the Forge theory forums which was partly why I thought Ron quite correct in closing them down, but in terms of people currently actively discussing theory it's basically just Jack isn't it?  I can't think of anyone else I know of currently actively involved in theory who doesn't play?<br/><br/>I think this thread may have been sparked by my use of the term over-zealous in the other thread.  I wonder if Tony read that and saw zealots instead, they're not the same thing.  We can all be over-zealous at times, often quite inadvertently.  Odd as it may sound, being over-zealous does not necessarily in this context make you a zealot.                        </div>

Absolutely true. Problem is, there's the issue of perception: Some folks paint "us" as Zealots. Which raises the question by Tony:<br/><br/>1) Why?<br/>1a) Is there credence to this claim?<br/><br/>And mine:<br/><br/>2) How do we fix that perception?<br/>2a) Is it worth fixing? (probably not actively)<br/>2b) Are there things "we" do that perpetuate that perception?

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>And of course folks like Kyle aka JimBob rubs his little weenie with glee as he jots your comparison down into his "anti-indie notebook", to be thrown into unrelated threads at the drop of a hat.</blockquote>See, Andy, that's where I don't see the whole symmetry that Max/Balbinus is arguing for here.<br/><br/>I do not see any theory-zealots gleefully caressing their metaphoric crotch when an enemy of theory says something stupid.<br/><br/>In this one thread, yeah, I'm asking "Hey, why is it that there are so many of those who reject theory who are using fuckwitted arguments?"  And <b>that</b> is exactly symmetric with those who say "Hey, why is it that there are so many of those who embrace theory who are using fuckwitted arguments?"<br/><br/>But, seriously?  Even among the theory zealots, I haven't seen somebody come into a theory discussion and "just mention" that ... fuck, I don't even know ... somebody accused me of supporting date-rape, right?  I seem to recall that.  I could "just mention" that in a totally unrelated thread, as an <i>ad hominem</i> attack on folks who dislike theory, but the idea doesn't even occur to me.  From what I can see, it doesn't even occur to ... pretty much anybody.  Nobody on the pro-theory side of the fence is stockpiling that sort of ammunition.<br/><br/>Or are they?  I totally accept that they may be doing it, and I've missed it.                        </div>

                            It's not symmetrical that way, that's me explaining my point badly.  The two groups do different dumb things.<br/><br/>The anti-theory crowd fuck up by going needlessly ad hominem.<br/><br/>The pro-theory crowd fuck up by talking to people instead of with them.<br/><br/>Not all in either case, but those are the key problems I think.  I know I cited two and two, but that was just because that's how the example struck me, usually on rpg.net I think it's more three or four core anti-theorists and one or two zealots, that said the damage each does to the debate is much the same as they both render it valueless.<br/><br/>The other non-symmetrical bit is that people unpersuaded by theory who are not zealots tend not to post on it at all.  Thus in a thread arguing theory some of those pro-theory will go over the top, most of those against who are posting will go over the top - a bigger proportion, as the guys who are into theory but aren't too zealous will still post to contribute while those who are unconvinced by theory but aren't too zealous most likely aren't reading the thread at all.<br/><br/>Thus the majority of theory opponents posting will be zealots, while most likely early in the thread the pro-theory zealots will be a minority.  Given time of course it does go to parity, as everyone who is not a zealot will have given up on the thread.                        </div>

                            I'll add that people who are happy with their gaming don't typically introspect enough to make any kind of generalizable theory for them to compare your assertions to, so if you're posting somewhere with a lot of happy gamers, your reception will be very different from if you post in a place full of bitter folks who can't find a group that's doing what they like.

You note how many people have been drawn into <i>thinking less of Ron</i> because he said a stupid thing that's been used as ammunition against the community?  You note how the ammunition-stockpiling turns theorists themselves into censors of theory?<br/><br/>This tactic that I see practiced against theorists ... it is not meant merely to win the argument of the moment.

                            Tony,<br/><br/>I think the only thing I'd add that isn't in your post is the feedback cycle.<br/><br/>Why do people get so virulently opposed to theory?  A variety of reasons, but one reason among them is because they've been talked down to a few times and got annoyed.  <br/><br/>So, the patronising is part of what produces the hostility, I'm not saying that's ok or not ok, but I think it's true.  There are other reasons, the ugly baby one I've posted about before, but one reason is that if someone has an interest in theory but gets talked down to they become hostile, and sometimes if it rankles enough they then can't leave it alone and take the battle to the next thread.  Being talked down to is kind of personal to the recipient after all.<br/><br/>But yeah, some of the anti-theory guys are trying to silence the theory guys.  That sucks, but it isn't and never will work.<br/><br/>The thing always to remember, as I said in the other thread, is you're not posting to explain stuff to the guy baiting you.  You're posting to explain to everyone else.  If generally you keep your cool, the odd crappy analogy won't make that much difference.  Put another way, I thought your five year old analogy was a terrible one, but I have seen enough of your stuff that I didn't let it bug me because I know you're a reasonable guy.  A history of reasonable posting will carry you over one bad example.<br/><br/>To sum up, it may seem to you that it works, but I don't think it does.  People who find the theory useful are using it and producing great games, and the games are the whole point after all.  As long as it helps people produce the games, the rest is noise.                        </div>

                            Well, let me offer this perspective, as someone who has little appreciation of theory:<br/><br/>Listening to someone talk about theory -- whether or not they shade over into full-on zealotry -- is like my experience (as an atheist) of listening to someone talk about how they've been Saved.  I tend to find it tiring, and at worst, outright contentious... and even though I'll participate in such a conversation on a surface level, if it starts to really delve, I get an allergic reaction and attempt to reject it, push it away.<br/><br/>I don't think my experience is all that unusual for a lot of people who feel they don't want or "get" the theory, and I think it goes a long way towards explaining why people might paint even well-intentioned theorists with a "zealotry" labelling brush.                        </div>

Being a theory abuser myself, I wanted to comment to this.  I see a lot of theory acolytes out there, who are like walking Big Model FAQs (or Threefold FAQs, or...)  From my point of view, they wind up being enough of a noise-source that I shy away from starting any forum discussion that would fall under the Big Model, because I know there'll be a welter of close-but-not-quite pat answers to my question.  Josh's recent questions about bangs and illusionism strike me as a perfect recent example.<br/><br/>Josh: So, explain to me how I can use Bangs without using Force to get to them.<br/>(The right answer: Big Model Force is not what you think it is.)<br/><br/>(Six different) Big Model Acolyte(s): The difference between Bangs and Illusionist "choices" are that with Bangs, the GM doesn't have anything worked out ahead of time.<br/><br/>...which is really just missing quotes and an attribution.<br/><br/>The lasting harm is that people <em>who are mildly interested</em> in the audience (i.e. who might otherwise participate) are repelled from these discussions by the the overwhelming noise of pat, dogmatic answers, which don't really educate anyone and tend to make what should be reasonable discussion read like a flame war.                        </div>

                            Here are five different sophist tricks which, if I see employed in a debate, will  piss me off and  convince me that the other party either has no real strength in their position, is a jerk, or is mimicking someone else's ideas and presentation<br/> <br/> * Referencing extensive, obscure source material and refusing discussion until that has been absorbed, thus creating a barrier of entry <b>and</b> elevating the status of the source material artificially.<br/> * Using difficult to penetrate jargon, and dwelling on definitions rather than touching upon the point, thus deflecting legitimate questions.<br/> * Establishing definitions and then declaring any discussion of the definitions to be inappropriate, because the definition is 'clear,' ignoring whether or not it is appropriate.<br/> * Declaring that any argument about theory has "already been had" and, if pressed, referring back to that extensive, obscure source material, thus dodging legitimate questions perpetually.<br/> * Lantern hanging, which is to say, framing the weakest part of your argument in the premise and establishing debate about a secondary point, forcing participants to either concede the premise or refuse to participate, which may or may not be desirable depending on the secondary point.<br/><br/>My response to these tactics, and others like them, remains the same across politics, religion, gaming and many other fields.  These are, in short, warning signs that the other party is not looking for debate, but rather is looking to spread the good word.<br/><br/>How applicable this is to the matter at hand is, no doubt, something people will disagree with me about.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

The GNS guys have won the theory wars, I don't think that makes it any more right than any other theory but the proponents of GNS have not in the main been silenced and IMO will not.<br/><br/>I appreciate when you're bogged down in some godawful thread getting ripped up because some guy somewhere else three years ago said something shitty it may not feel that way, but each time a small number of folk go away persuaded and none of that silences the main proponents of the theory, the games.                        </div>

                            For what my anecdotal evidence is worth - <br/><br/>This is one of the reasons* I don't tend to post stuff about theory.  It's not due to lack of interest, it's because whenever I come out in favour of something vaguely forgish I tend to get buried under responses treating me like a zealot advocating a much wider position.  It's kinda difficult to just dip a toe in without getting bogged down in irrelevant arguments.  It's like the problems discussing wikipiedia - you can want to drown it in your love-fluids or you can want to burn it to the ground and shit on the ashes - you're not allowed to have an opinion in between.<br/><br/>So, yeah.  The problem certainly exists and, intentionaly or not (I'm not convinced this is actually the intended goal of anti-theory speak), it <i>has</i> largely silenced me on the topic.  I just find it too difficult to maintain a conversation on the subject.<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 60%; font-size: 60%;">*The other reason being that I put my foot in my mouth far too often when I try to make unconditional statements about stuff.</span> </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I hear a lot about these zealots that (supposedly) make up the vast majority of people who use and study Forge-ish theory.  Apparently the zealots tell other people that they don't understand their own play, say that mainstream games have never reached an audience, and base their entire foundation of thought on the certainty that the last digit of Pi is 6.<br/><br/>Are there really that many idiots out there?  Or is it a self-perpetuating meme?</blockquote>
There are idiots everywhere, Tony.  It's fundamental to human nature.  I'm sure that there are that many idiots in and out of theoretical circles.  There are those on the side of theory that take their nugget of knowledge and bash people over the head with it.  As Ms. DiFranco says, "Any tool is a weapon if you hold it right."  And there are those (RPGPundit, fr'ex), who take the mob rule mentality and declaim that since the majority of game users either don't use or don't really need theory that theory is therefore useless.<br/><br/>The theory is beside the point, really - it's human nature to mistrust those who would exert authority over you, even in a very intangible way.  Theory is authority - its main purpose is to say 'I understand what you're doing' - most people just add '...better than you do.' to the end of that statement, whether it's meant or not.
<blockquote>Further, given how few of these extremists I see around (and they really do seem, to me, to be a dying sub-species) and how very many people use the "Theorists are crazy!" argument, I don't see how the numbers can work out in terms of all those people having been personally affronted by theory-nutjobs.  I believe that the idea of the theory-zealot has made the jump from being an accurate description of existing trends (like "Hey, if you're hiking watch out for mountain lions ... one of 'em damn near bit my hand off!") to being a self-reinforcing legend ("Hey, watch out for Big Foot!  I heard about a guy whose cousin's co-worker's fiance ran off with that hairy casanova!")</blockquote>
They're a dying breed mainly because there's no one place that they can hold court, now that theory is <i>verboten</i> on The Forge.<br/><br/>For myself, I try to be as open and non-zealous as possible.  Non-judgement and non-valuation is the key, here.  Evaluate the play, not the players.                        </div>

Are you serious? Of course it works. It probably doesn't work on Tony, but you can bet it works on a whole bunch of other would-be posters who want to bring up some theory, and then remember what happened to the last guy who did that. <br/><br/>I know that you're trying to cast yourself as the emminently reasonable person in this discussion, but if you're going to pretend no harm is being done on one side then you might as well go both ways and say that nobody is ever affected by being talked-down-to by some pro-theory person. Except that, as you point out, they are -- they hold grudges, it affects their postings, etc.  Why you think pro-theory people are immune to fallout from bad social treatment and anti-theory people are not is unclear to me.                        </div>

And that's *here* and on The Forge (the enclaves?)<br/><br/>Question: If it turned out that the number of people being turned off to theory because of the condescending attitude of a few was far, far greater than the number of people not posting theory threads because of the heated nature of them would that make a difference?

                            Tony asks:<br/>
<br/>
Are there really that many idiots out there? Or is it a self-perpetuating meme?<br/>
<br/>
There are some people who sometimes look like idiots to a casual glance.  I probably spent the first 6 months I was reading the Forge thinking that a good dozen people were arseholes.  Not because of how they behaved to me, because I saw interactions with other people, revolving around theory, that I interpreted as rude, patronising, mean, dismissive, childish or bullying.  In time, I came to realise that they were clever people, with interesting ideas, who were usually nice and funny and so on.  But there seemed to be a culture of communication strategies that were wildly open to misinterpretation and didn't cast the participants in a good light.  Sometimes they can look a lot like zealots.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that this explains all of it, or even most of it.  But any discussion about how a group appears should consider what that group does that impact on how others perceive them.<br/>

<i>Are there really that many idiots out there? Or is it a self-perpetuating meme?</i><br/><br/>I can already see the meme happening in this very thread:  Posts about how "I've seen the whole "you don't understand what you enjoy in play" thing tons of times", "theorists talk to people instead of with them" and "Read these three threads over here, A B and C." None of which I encounter very often, if at all. <br/><br/>In theory discussions I think there's a lot of people reading what they want to read, or maybe what they expect to read. Anti-theory folk read a condescending attitude in the posts of theorists, theorists read a confrontational attitude in the posts of anti-theorists.<br/><br/>Example: Joshua's thread was called: <b>Explain to me how Bangs are not warmed-over Illusionism</b><br/><br/>In Judson's words:<br/><i>(Six different) Big Model Acolyte(s): The difference between Bangs and Illusionist "choices" are that with Bangs, the GM doesn't have anything worked out ahead of time.</i><br/><br/>How's that not an appropriate answer? Why is this an example of the condescending attitude? I don't see it. I didn't read any talking down to Joshua in that thread, but here it's already used as an example twice.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>[T]he only way I can think to make it relevant is if you feel that a tactic that is consistently and deliberately silencing people based on their beliefs is<i>not a big deal</i>, so long as it is possible for people to get around it, even a little, even if it's a constant grinding effort.<br/><br/>Is that what you think, or am I reading too much in?</blockquote>I thought of a more generous way to read this ... you could also be saying "Hey, yeah, this<i>sucks</i>. It sucks hard. But it's not the end of the world either. You guys rock, and you're getting the message out anyway, and that's something to feel good about even in the face of the rest of this bad stuff."<br/><br/>I'm sorry I didn't see that interpretation earlier. I'm a bit worked up on the subject, and while I try to rein it in, it does make silver linings hard for me to spot.<br/><br/>Exactly, that's also my point that I think I didn't get over clearly to Ice Cream Emperor.  I'm not saying nobody is being silenced, I'm not saying that it doesn't matter or people don't get hurt, I'm saying that overall you (collectively) are getting the message out anyway and that means overall you (collectively) are winning.  I'm saying although it sucks and is bloody frustrating and can be extremely shitty you are nonetheless getting your (collective) message out there and that is something to be pleased about.<br/><br/>I'm not pretending nobody gets hurt or upset on the pro-theory side, I'm not saying that (I don't think I said it anywhere in this thread actually or anywhere else).  I'm also not saying that nobody gets silenced or nobody gets unfairly demonised.  I'm also not trying to paint myself as the eminently reasonable guy while sniping at the theorists as Ice Cream Emperor rather uncharitably suggested.<br/><br/>To use military analogies, you can lose battles but still win the war.  I don't see it really in those terms, but it is a fruitful analogy because that's what's happening.  Sometimes battles get lost, some guys get hurt or silenced, but overall the war is getting won and the word is getting out there.<br/><br/>I mean, don't overplay the military analogy because it's a bit of a dangerous one, but I still assert that the theory guys are not being silenced (collectively) and the knowledge of the theory is growing.  Individual theory guys might shut up or get flamed into oblivion or get too upset to bother continuing and that is not ok, but as a group the theory guys are not being silenced and I do not think they will be.<br/><br/>And Ice Cream, I didn't say pro-theory people were immune from negative fallout.  That would be inane in a thread the purpose of which in large part is to discuss the negative fallout on the theory guys.  You clipped my post in quoting me, the previous sentence that you didn't quote used the word overall which I think made it fairly plain I was making a general statement and later on in the same post in another bit you didn't quote I talked about how the GNS guys had "in the main" not been silenced.  It's only by selective quoting you had me making a blanket statement, and I don't think that was particularly fair.                        </div>

Actually, what happened was that I responded to your earlier post immediately, without reading through the rest of the thread -- which had already included some back and forth on this, where you used the "overall" statement. Which is totally my mistake -- I had a rather visceral reaction to the original statement, which to be fair did not include any qualifiers other than context, and I posted without reading further along.

                            I often think that when people say things like "Theorists never play anyway", it's more a cry of frustration than an argument. <br/><br/>They're frustrated, I think, by a lot of very academic, technical language, which seems alien to the idea of playing for fun.<br/><br/>So, although Tony's sort of right to say:
<blockquote>Folks who don't understand theory, or who understand it and don't want to hear it, denigrate the entire exercise with a broad ad hominem argument.</blockquote>
I'm not sure they're <i>trying</i> to argue. The fact that they don't want to hear it is the interesting point: it's a reflection of how inaccessible the theory seems to them. That inaccessibility, I think, would be a problem worth addressing.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>[Edited last paragraph so it made more sense]                        </div>

Because if you are then we'll have to have words.<br/><br/>But if you're just saying "Yes, those people are EVIL, and in the fight against evil Levi has shown us a good strategy," then yeah, I'm right there with you.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think that in our laudable desire to concentrate on the useful, good things that we can do we've forgotten to be <b>outraged</b>.  Will being outraged directly help us communicate our points better?  No, it will not.  But it might well help us not to feel alone amidst a sea of enemies.  It might help us to realize that things are difficult not merely because we fail to live up to our own full potential, but because some people are deliberately trying to silence us.  It might give some of us, who have been long silenced, the courage to speak up.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd like to see more people take the practical knowledge of how to craft a post so as to communicate rather than inflame and combine it with the community spirit to say "When (not if) I get unfairly slammed for daring to speak out, I will not be alone.  I am right to speak out, even if I receive vitriol in return."                        </div>

                            JD:  Actually, yes I do think there are people like this.<br/><br/>I said, long ago and far away, that I did not believe that <i>just because person B is offended at what person A does</i> that automatically means that person A is in the wrong.  That, in short, sometimes people get pissed off at you, even when you're right.  If there is no <i>other</i> factor (like, things that are against the law are still against the law, of course) then it's legitimate to say "Hey, I know you're upset, but I did what I think is right."<br/><br/>People have willfully chosen to interpret that as me saying "Anything is permissible!  There is no morality!"  When I say "That's not even vaguely what I said," they respond with "Nuh-uh!  I don't care what you say NOW!  There's no way that you can deny the rightness of my interpretation of your meaning!"<br/><br/>They have said that I condone racism.  They have said that I condone date-rape.  They have said these things to my face, and then when I told them they were wrong they went and said the same things in different discussions of which I had no part.<br/><br/>I am, as a direct consequence, currently engaged in correcting someone who felt like saying that Forge-theorists condone date-rape.  I wasn't even in that discussion, I just happened upon somebody working hard to perpetuate the meme.<br/><br/>How's that sit with you?  Am I entitled to some outrage, or should I do my zen meditation and remind myself that they're simply following the god of their own enlightened conscience?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What the fuck??? You actually think there are people like this? Seriously. Deep breaths.</blockquote>
There are: There's probably under 10 such people in the world (ie "On The Internet"), but at least half of them are very vocal/repetitive. It's really such a small amount of people that it's hardly worth bothering with. And yet, it'd still be nice if there were none. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I guess the Internet is a big old place and there's always going to be someone somewhere who falls into whatever category you can think of, therefore the only way to solve the issue is stay off the Internet.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Am I entitled to some outrage, or should I do my zen meditation and remind myself that they're simply following the god of their own enlightened conscience?</blockquote>
Hmmm.....   Neither?<br/><br/>I mean, you want to get full-on outraged, feel free, it's your right.  You've been provoked, to be sure.  Oddly, I think that if someone does that to you in in a gaming discussion, the best way is to pull out one of Ron's basic full-stop things - the "I have no interest in the conversation you're trying to get me into." thing.<br/><br/>What to do when they snark on you or yours in conversations you're not even in, I dunno.  I tend to thank them for the free advertising, myself, but that's me.                        </div>

                            It honestly would make me feel better on a <b>lot</b> of levels.<br/><br/>First, yeah ... name recognition.  But more importantly, if they'll name me then they're only attacking <i>me</i>.  People can say "Wow, that Tony guy sure sounds like a jerk!"  That would mean that by going out and posting theory I'd only be making <i>myself</i> a target.  But as it is, the folks who spread these distortions (and the legions who eagerly believe and retell them) are going after <i>my friends</i>.  They are making my words into a weapon that they then turn upon everyone.<br/><br/>I'm not cool with that.  I totally agree that posting in a calm and rational manner is still the way to go, and that's what I do (as much as I can), but I'm also going to own this outrage and draw strength from it, rather than shove it down into my gut and let it sink its claws in.                        </div>

Yes and no...<br/><br/>Yes, it's an asinine process (For anyone playing the home game and not quite keeping up or not believing that the process exists, see also: "Brain Damage").  Yes, it's meant to smear theorists as a whole.<br/><br/>No, in that what they're attacking is a fiction.  It's a strawman.  And they're kicking his highly-stuffed ass up one side and down the other.  But there is no such thing as a theory hivemind.  People thinking about RPGs in a theory-type way, so far as I can see, have unqualified agreement on only two things:<br/><br/>1. RPGs are fun!<br/><br/>2. Jungle Speed, also fun!<br/><br/>...And I'm not sure that everyone agrees on the second one.<br/><br/>I find that crediting and defending *their* stawman is an exercise in time-wasting.                        </div>

Yeah, it's a big problem.  It's one of the issues with online discussions.  It is kind of hard to footnote, since there are thousands of messages scattered around which come out constantly.  Whereas in pre-Internet debate, you'd instead have longer articles which appear in magazines or APAs.  I try to footnote, but it's still really common to generalize.  <br/><br/>i.e. You get broad statements like <i>X people</i> think traditional gamers are deluded fools in the land of broken wheels, or <i>Y people</i> think system doesn't matter and railroading is the right way to get story, etc.  <br/><br/>I think one approach is to break the perception the variety of theories and theorists.  i.e. The authors of the Turku manifesto are pretty from the Forge folk, etc.                        </div>

                            Levi:  I'm not so much worried that people are hurt directly by the attacks on the strawmen.  It's not like I fear that there are some closet race-baiters (or whatever) out there who are going to feel hurt that their secret shame has been revealed.<br/><br/>But when people see how their words can be turned into that sort of slander against them it makes them <i>not want to offer their words</i>.  And that's sad for everyone.  I don't like seeing my words used to pound home the message that nobody should expect justice or honesty.

Hitler was cited as an example of someone with high Charisma in the 1st Edition DMG (red devil variety).  Since the example was a positive one, it generated a lot of controversy.  If it had been 'Hitler is an exemplar of someone who eats kitten for breakfast', it wouldn't have been that bad.<br/><br/>In retorspect, a poor idea.

Awesome!<br/><br/>And to address Judd, I think that the identity politics are certainly part of it--but there are a few other things I would cite:<br/>1. A generally positive energy (not coming from a place of focusing on dysfunction)<br/>2. Not being prescriptive in broad strokes (saying this or that game is bad or good or even better or worse)<br/>3. Treating people with respect--even people with whom he 180-degrees disagrees and who aren't always well spoken.<br/>4. No covert agenda I can discern.<br/>5. Being vocal about aspects of theory he doesn't like or disagrees with.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's a lot more and these may not even be the most relevant ones, but they are the ones that come to mind. Levi doesn't come off as either a dedicated iconoclast nor as someone who's "drunk the kool aid." I think that's responsible for a lot of positive conversation.<br/>-Marco                        </div>

Right now, it sounds totally like rubbish to me; can you spell it out for me?" - and he will, and he can do the same to me should it be necessary.<br/><br/>See, that took a while for me to actually do; to come at him as a person instead of a 'personality'.<br/><br/>I don't ever want to discover that I've become a 'personality'.<br/><br/>Please don't make me into one.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Call Me Curly</cite>I'm just saying-- not<i>all</i>bitter grumbling is unfathomable troll-spew.</blockquote>
That thread's about what I received when I posted a couple of game ideas Back in the Day.  After being schooled in the Official Process (of which there's a lot more these days), I was bombarded by questions formed in Forgespeak: "Do you explore your Premise through Color, or have you simply given the Ephemera extra weight in the Gamist frame?"  Absolutely none of it was <i>hostile</i> or <i>rude</i>, but it was still <i>off-putting</i>, because I was being asked to step into (and/or embrace) the Forge paradigm in order to get some feedback.<br/><br/>Since I don't have any real use for the Forge paradigm or GNS-centric help, I was out of luck and went on my merry way, taking what I could from what I'd gotten.<br/><br/>But that's why I've only posted ... 8 times, and not since almost exactly four years ago on the Forge, despite being very much interested in the kinds of stuff it advocates: the Forge is like a foreign royal court.  It's a perfectly nice place, even hospitable.  But if you don't speak the language or know the customs, it's a confusing, frustrating and tiresome place to try to enter.<br/><br/>Which, taken in a broader context, is what the anti-theory backlash is about: instead of explaining to folks how theory helps them (in plain language), then mentioning that this is X Theory: Blah Blah Blah, a lot of people are smacked directly with hard theoryspeak and then expected to follow up.  Put another way: if your first reaction is to send someone to the Forge Provisional Glossary (or any similar document), you're probably not being a big help.                        </div>

The fact that one guy is making a bad, fallacy-ridden argument <i>does not</i> mean that the argument the other guy is making is a good one.  They can both be wrong.<br/><br/>Which is part of why fallacious argument makes discussion worse for everyone:  If I go in and address an <i>ad hominem</i> attack, it takes time and focus away from actually making my own point.  It makes the discussion <i>about the discussion</i> rather than about the subject.                        </div>

You can go check out my "One Simple Thing" series of threads on RPG.Net ... not only do I not use theory-speak, I rarely rise above words of one <i>syllable</i>.  I consciously say it in english that should be clear to anyone with a third grade education.<br/><br/>That series of threads?  That's where people have grabbed the quotes that they twist in order to say that I support the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>So yeah, saying things in simple english is a vital thing.  It helps you communicate.  But it doesn't mollify the people who hate the theory on principle, and it doesn't shield you from their tactics.<br/><br/>I can't say <i>for sure</i> that this isn't a case that they were so distressed by their initial encounter with complex language that now they're soured forever, no matter how simple the language they see theory presented in.  But frankly?  I don't care.  If they had a bad experience and decide that they're never going to let go of it, even in the face of better experiences later, that's just stupid.                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I really liked your one simple thing threads.  Sometimes the thing seemed really obvious to me, but each time at the beginning of the thread you said some people would find that and they should move on, so I did and that was cool.<br/><br/>And then sometimes it wasn't so obvious to me, or it seemed obvious but turned out to be slightly different than I imagined.  I got value from those, partly because you communicated so well in them.<br/><br/>So I'm genuinely sorry you got beat up over them, but that was still good stuff and perhaps selfishly I'm still glad you did it.

                            Kuma, thanks for the Hitler reference, I've been wondering about that for years.<br/><br/><br/>Now, regarding this stuff:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Call Me Curly</cite>I come to this discussion having just minutues-ago read<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17074.0" rel="nofollow">this shameful old Forge thread,</a>in which Ron Edwards mouthed-off to some new guy.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Call Me Curly</cite>Here's a more subtle, more commonplace<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21718.0" rel="nofollow">example.</a>. . .[snip]. . .But everything he says, he's told he's doing it wrong:   He's violating forum rules. He's not specific enough. He tries to use Power 19 and is told Power 19 isn't good for soliciting feedback.  He tries to play-along with Forge-talk, and is told that his layman's understanding of GNS is all wrong.</blockquote>
Whoa, now. In the first case, yeah, Ron came down a bit too hard, but I think only because the poor dude was a completely new poster (not that that's not an important concern, treatment of new Forge posters is key to this thread). If he wasn't new, Ron's post was basically just "who, you're TOTALLY not getting it, and really I'm getting tired of his particular misconception coming up again and again," which is legit for Forge discussion with "regulars." The Brain Damage thing, well, Ron's said that he really did not get that "Brain Damage" is a juvenile insult among younger folk, his generational equivalent being "retard," and I'm inclined to believe him. (I must be on the cusp, I heard both "retard" AND "brain damage" growing up.) So that bit may be ill-concieved, but not really jerky <i>per se.</i><br/><br/>But that's controversial, and I agree he was hard on the guy.What I really take issue with is the next one.<br/><br/>I read the thread, and I don't see what you're describing at all. What I see is a guy coming on the Forge, posting "hey, I'm designing a game, it's about X, here's a link to the rules, any advice?" And I see, very legitimately, a couple of guys very gently and helpfully (as in, "that's nbot enough to go on, tell us more about the game," not "You're posting wrong, go away!") pointing out where his post is too vague to allow for any real criticism, and suggesting information he can provide to enable them to help him. And so far, he <i>still</i> hasn't given them much to go on, but it looks like dialogue is proceeding fruitfully if slowly. I mean, he <i>isn't</i> following forum rules, and he <i>isn't</i> being specific enough, but the two guys are being patient and inviting and sticking it out to help the guy. I really take issue at this thread being held up as an example of what's <i>wrong</i> with the Forge. If this kind of behavior is indicative of what a lot of people don't like about the Forge, it stikes me that a lot of people must be really hard to please.<br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite>That thread's about what I received when I posted a couple of game ideas Back in the Day.  After being schooled in the Official Process (of which there's a lot more these days), I was bombarded by questions formed in Forgespeak: "Do you explore your Premise through Color, or have you simply given the Ephemera extra weight in the Gamist frame?"

See, again, I don't get it. I can't speak for <i>your</i> experience, Kuma, but the thread in question shows the <i>opposite</i>: It's the new guy who brings up the GNS terms (and yes, he DID get them wrong), and the guys tell him, don't worry about that, it probably won't help you right now, just state your design goals in real everyday terms. So, as with Curly's comments, it seems like the Forge is damned if it do, and damned if it don't. It can't use jargon, and it can't not use jargon; it can't be brusque and off-putting, and it can't be friendly and down-to-earth. What CAN it be?
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite>Since I don't have any real use for the Forge paradigm or GNS-centric help, I was out of luck and went on my merry way, taking what I could from what I'd gotten.</blockquote>
No real use? For starters, it could be of use in communicating with this particular group of people better and finding out what they have to offer your understanding of design and play. Which, if it's not worth it to you, fine, but then, you went willingly to that site, you know? It's like going to a Freudian analyst, then dismissing his analysis because you have no real use for Freudian psychology. And then complaining that he was unhelpful. If there's a community that practices a particular intellectual discipline, is it any surprise that you find it unhelpful if you can't be bothered to learn the discipline? (Or disagree with it, or whatever. No judgment here of WHY you don't value the discipline, just asking: OK then, are you surprised?)<br/><br/>I guess I'm just wondering, where's the controversy? I can't really find a way to frame the objection that doesn't sound like "Those guys that practice a discipline, it's so annoying that they practice that discipline!"<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            I think the difference is that Tony is using hyperbole in a non-confrontational context.  He isn't bearding a critic and throwing hyperbole at him, he's using it as part of an internal discussion as it were.<br/><br/>Hyperbole to make a point doesn't bother me much, hyperbole as a technique in a dialogue to do down the other guy does.<br/><br/>Plus I like Tony, people I like are more likely to get a pass from me, that isn't consistent and I don't defend it particularly but generally I care more about whether I like someone than whether they're right or not.  I'm loyal, but amoral, in that regard.<br/><br/>More seriously, observer bias.  I like Tony, thus I read his stuff with a friendly eye.  Were I to read it without that, perhaps I would read it differently.  We all have our biases.<br/><br/>Melinglor, let's not get into the brain damage thing here.  I know you didn't raise it, but I find the argument that it's ok as a term if you don't know teenagers use it as an insult pretty laughable.  I struggle to imagine a context where referring to someone as brain damaged would not be seen as insulting, I was quite unaware that it was an insult in a particular demographic and I still think it's pretty fucking offensive.  Is this really the thread to get into that?  For what it's worth by the way I merely thought that absurd, my objection to that thread was primarily to the child abuse analogy, which I have no intention of discussing further here but which for a variety of reasons I thought was a repulsive analogy and which I thought John Wick quite properly called him on.  I feel able to say, to put it bluntly, that there is no fucking scenario on Earth in which being abused as a child is comparable to being taught to play Vampire.  The experiences and the effects are quite distinguishable and drawing a parallel is internet fuckwaddery of the highest order.  One can sensibly draw a line under it and move on, but I don't think it can really be defended.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Call Me Curly</cite>How is Tony's use of hyperbole in describing the charges made against theory-heads <b>any different</b> from<br/>critics' use of hyperbole in describing the actual behavior of theory-heads?</blockquote>Hey, quick question for clarity:  Do you think that when I say, for instance "People accuse theorists of supporting the Ku Klux Klan" and "People accuse me of advocating date-rape" that I'm just making up crazy examples?<br/><br/>Because every single such example I've used is something that people have literally and repeatedly said.  Just FYI.<br/><br/>So maybe you're describing something else I've said as hyperbole, in a way that I'd totally agree with ... or maybe you think that my descriptions <i>must</i> be hyperbole, because nobody would <i>actually</i> say the things that I'm quoting them as saying.  I'd sort of like to know which is which, if that's not too much bother.                        </div>

Amen to that.   <br/><br/>I am exquisitely aware that Ron Edwards does his level-best, with herculean endurance, to improve a hobby that's often stagnant, indifferent, miserable, petty, ungrateful, ignorant... <br/><br/>Subsequently, Ron (and Vincent, Luke, Clinton, Ben, Tony, so many others) are often faced with the lose-lose choice between:<br/><br/>1. Not doing anything at all, because that would be the only choice which would silence <i>all</i> critics.<br/><br/>2. Doing something which requires a judgement-call: a decision to displease some observers in order to further a greater purpose.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>So, as with Curly's comments, it seems like the Forge is damned if it do, and damned if it don't.

Uh...  <br/><br/>Some people want fancy words.  Some don't.  Some people want brusque; some want down-to-earth.  No matter what tack is taken, someone will *always* be offended.<br/><br/>That, in and of itself, isn't the problem.<br/><br/>The problem is people coming in, that have heard scurrilous bullshit, and are posting to the Forge as some kind of "I'll give it a chance, but they better treat me right, or I'll walk." - they are <i>prepared</i> to be offended, and thus they naturally take offense.<br/><br/>If you go to a community with the attitude of being 'charitable' to it, you've already done a disservice to both the community and to yourself, and it will only get worse unless you can resolve it yourself.<br/><br/>I know this, because I've been guilty of it myself a couple of times.                        </div>

If you look back, he equated theory-zealots with bigfoot, something people refer to as having been seen out there but which nobody can point to directly.<br/><br/>I think he's wrong as it happens, I think they do exist (zealots, not bigfoot), but the analogy was of zealots to bigfoot, not critics to bigfoot-believers.                        </div>

It's cool, although on reflection it would be ironic if I had silenced you on the topic...<br/><br/>That's not my intent, you seem like an ok guy and I may agree with you on some stuff and disagree with you on other stuff but please don't let me put you off posting anything.

                            Tony,<br/>It's clear the date-rape thing really got to you. Let me see if I can clear it up here:<br/><br/>1. Just because someone considers something a "game" doesn't make any behavior not prohibited by "the rules" okay. It's a rather extreme example, yes--but you have, IMO, an extreme stance on the matter so to get your agreement there--and there *is* agreement there, it has to be extreme.<br/><br/>2. You have an unspoken raft of rules of behavior (like everyone else on the planet) you blame people for not following (the slick frat-boy date guy has a different set, of course). Again, it's an extreme example because you have an extreme position (IMO).<br/><br/>That telling you straight out that I'm not accusing you of supporting date-rape (here, previously here, and there a few times) doesn't seem to work, I conclude that your emphasis on explict communication to clear up a group's social contract is some kind of irony.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I disagreed with you in a few of the Simple Thing threads as well--such as the first one where in you brought the idea that the speaker is being intentionally deceptive (a liar) into a situation where I do not feel it is warranted.<br/><br/>Disagreeing with that (and we sort of settled it--although your final take was that figures of speech are 'lies,' IIRC--something I do not believe would really piss off your friends as you have it doing in the first OP) is not the same as hating theorists or hating theory.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

I'm pretty sure I agree with you more than Tony with respect to the competition argument, but I don't think that this particular thread is the place to hash out who is right.  I'm not sure that anyone would mind if you dropped it into another thread, though.                        </div>

                            Lantern hanging is actually something out of politics.  It was most clearly illustrated in Chris Matthew's Magnificent book of political advice, <i>Hardball</i>* as a piece of advice: "Hang a lantern on your problem" (though I suspect, like much in the book, it's sourced from somewhere else.)<br/><br/><br/>It's a pretty simple idea in execution.  Do you have some issue that you do not want your opponent to bring up because it reflects very badly on you?  Well, he's going to, so the only way you can short circuit that is if you shine a light ("hang a lantern") on the problem yourself.  This allows you to "control the message" and when done right, it can move beyond mere damage control to turning those problems into assets, or into highlighting your assets.  As an extra bonus, if you do it right, anyone who subsequently brings up the issue looks like they're being petulant or mean spirited because you already stepped up on this.<br/><br/>Consider a job interview.  You have a candidate who is lacking in some key skill, and that's probably going to tank his likelihood of getting the job.  If you are the one who brings it up, or it doesn't come up, there's no way you're going to hire him.  However, if he brings it up, and puts it front and center, and uses it as the launching point for why that skill doesn't matter for one reason or another, his odds go up.  Why? Well, he's had a chance to make a pitch that he would not otherwise have done so, and on an emotional level it's hard not to respect his courage for going out on a ledge like that because, on a purely instinctive level, we recognize that pointing out our own flaws is kind of scary. <br/><br/>This latter point is part of why this gimmick works so well on the internet - pointing out your own flaws online _is_ easier than doing it face to face, but still produces an emotional payout.<br/><br/>One of the most pointed examples of this was in the second Reagan/Mondale debate in the 1984 election.  Reagan had done miserably in the first debate, and had seemed very out of it.  In the intervening time, that performance had raised the question of whether Reagan was perhaps too old for the job, and that that was starting to tell.  When the second debate began, it opened with a question about the needs for endurance and clarity in the job, but Reagan was ready: "I will not make my age an issue in this campaign.  I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth an inexperience."  He knocked it out of the park.  It was funny, it was a 10 second sound bite, and it killed the issue (and at that point, Mondale's chances) dead.<br/><br/>So, I should note, the tactic itself is no better or worse than any deflection - it is equally valid for moving past spurious issues and on to the heart of the matter as it is for skipping past substantial issues and onto fluff.  As such, it is not the use of the tactic which bothers me (though it will always ping the radar when it happens) so much as the misuse.  The question is always whether the issue the lantern's been put on is a real one or just a distraction.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>* The quality and success of that book is why Matthews got a TV show and went on to become a b list celebrity.  He's never matched it, but <i>Hardball</i> is the closest analog to <i>The Prince</i> in a western democracy you're going to find.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Melinglor</cite><br/>So, as with Curly's comments, it seems like the Forge is damned if it do, and damned if it don't. It can't use jargon, and it can't not use jargon; it can't be brusque and off-putting, and it can't be friendly and down-to-earth. What CAN it be?</blockquote>
This is straying from the point of the thread, so I'm going to bring it back: Theorists, if they're going to be any help to people, need to popularize what they're rabbiting on about, using theory to help people with specific problems, but not framing it in jargon.  That can come in a paragraph at the end.  And to direct this a bit towards Tony - yes, there are folks (like you) who take the time to do just that.  But more often than not, I've seen Forgites appear (outside of the Forge) as standard-bearers of the Big Model, unable or unwilling to go easy or take their time.  Part of the reason that GNS is such a hot-button issue on RPG.net is that there's a long history of Forge folks popping over when a GNS thread comes up to hand out corrections and deal theory from on high, instead of just using the Big Model to help, say, a GM who feels like he's always railroading.
<blockquote>If there's a community that practices a particular intellectual discipline, is it any surprise that you find it unhelpful if you can't be bothered to learn the discipline? (Or disagree with it, or whatever. No judgment here of WHY you don't value the discipline, just asking: OK then, are you surprised?)<br/><br/>I guess I'm just wondering, where's the controversy? I can't really find a way to frame the objection that doesn't sound like "Those guys that practice a discipline, it's so annoying that they practice that discipline!"</blockquote>
I was already familiar with GNS when I went there - I was trying to decide whether or not the discipline had merit.  I liked the designs of other people who hung out there (I was very interested in Universalis at the time), and I wanted to see if some of that mojo could rub off on me.  Instead, I got rubbed the wrong way.  In a way, that was liberating because I've gone off and worked up my own theories, which are helping me immensely.  (I have no evidence that they're helping anyone else, yet.)<br/><br/>My main point is this: The Big Model (at least by observing the constellation of people around it) is something that you have to <i>believe in</i> and accept as being true before it can help you.  It seems like either you buy into it completely, or you get nothing out of it.  I don't think theory should work like that, necessarily.  Theory should be able to generate processes and models that people can use, whether they're familiar with the underlying theoretical substructure that generated them.<br/><br/>You shouldn't have to competely understand the Big Model (or the AGE Model) to benefit from either of them.                        </div>

                            This conversation is getting difficult for me, for several reasons.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite>But more often than not, I've seen Forgites appear (outside of the Forge) as standard-bearers of the Big Model, unable or unwilling to go easy or take their time.

First reason, if we're going to keep talking about "those people," I have no way to address that. You and (most)everyone else is acknowledging that Tony, for instance, is a reasonable and accessible theory-purveyor, and I've outlined my own jargon-lite approach elsewhere, which was applauded. These OTHER people, these zealous Alices who "deal theory from on high," I don't know them. I can't address them. I don't know how prevalent or infuential they are. But, (and I mean this, I'm not just throwing up my hands) I may simply not have wide enough expereince in RPG forums to participate in this conversation, and if so, that's fine.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite><br/>I was already familiar with GNS when I went there - I was trying to decide whether or not the discipline had merit.

Instead, I got rubbed the wrong way.</blockquote>
The second reason is that I'm getting mixed signals. Your earier post, Kuma, didn't indicate that you were already familiar and trying to evaluate. It sounded more like you didn't want to learn the theory ("no real use for the Forge paradigm") and so gave up on trying to get feedback from that site.<br/><br/>In any case, my larger point in my past post was that the thread quoted by Curly was NOT like your "drowned in jargon" experience. It was the opposite. Yet Curly cites it as an example of "Forge posting gone wrong," and you chime in that it's like your own negative experience. And since the meat of this thread seems to be in pointing to positive and negative examples to back up claims, I must insist that the thread in question is about as positive as could be. The posters there are doing exactly what everyone here says they want: for Forge theorists to lay aside jargon and engage people in real-people, accessible terms.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite><br/>My main point is this: The Big Model (at least by observing the constellation of people around it) is something that you have to<i>believe in</i>and accept as being true before it can help you.

I'm not sure what to make of this. Yes, tehory's value is in utility. And I do think that a lot of Big Model concepts work fine in isolation, especially the Social Contract stuff about clear and constructive communication. But on another level, no theory that contains any "if A, then B" kinds of statements are going to be useful to someone who doesn't accept "A." To that person, "B" is meaningless gibberish, because "A" is faulty. Or maybe they DO accept "B" as a legitimate phenomenon/practice, but since they don't believe in "A" as a cause the steps they take to bring about "B" will be completely different. So yeah, you may have to accept certain propositions before the Big Model will help you. What's so surprising about that?<br/><br/>Other stuff:<br/><br/>To Levi, regarding the "charitable" approach: Complete agreement. I'm not sure if you're trying to say this contrasts with my POV, but if you are, I'm not seeing it.<br/><br/>To Curly, I comepletely agree that these people (and anyone else who puts their work/thought out there) are not above scrutiny. But I don't really think that constructive and reasonable critique is what this thread is about.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            OK, looking back, I can see what you were going for (though the post did <i>start</i> with discussion of theory jerks, not well-intentioned-misguided-approach-theory-guys). But I contend that the responses in the thread are mischaracterized in your posts. "A bunch of canned answers," "processed, instead of answered". . .I just don't see it. You said in the previous post that "He gamely jumps through a whole bunch of Forge hoops, and still doesn't get feedback on his game."  I don't think that's true. He did get feedback, or at least start to. What I'm seeing is a guy coming in with an impossibly vague question, and a couple of guys (when they <i>could</i> have just said, "hey, that's against the rules*, beat it!") taking the time to try to narrow the inquiry down to something specific enough to GIVE feedback on. If you want to liken it to the "customer service runaround," imagine getting a customer service call asking, "tell me how to use my computer." "What do you mean, sir, what do you want to use it for?" "Oh, anything, I just want whatever advice you have about using it general." From that angle, I see the two posters as gamely jumping through <i>his</i> hoops. It's too bad he hasn't continued, it sounded like things were proceeding pretty constructively. I didn't find their responses "canned" at all. Are they similar to the questions they would probably ask of <i>anyone</i> who posted such a broad feedback request? Sure, but it's just part of a necessary narrowing-down process.<br/><br/>I don't think this is just a tangent or beating a dead horse, because this is central to the whole debate: what standards Forge folks are held to (and while we're at it, what standards <i>they</i> hold folks to). If the thread in question is held up as a problem, even from a "look at it from his point of view" angle, I have to question the reasonableness of that standard. The Forge in its turn upholds standards of posting on its site, and I suppose it's those that are being objected to, or at least pointed to as the source of newbies' off-putting. But I don't think the standards are unreasonable. Maybe my standards of discourse (especially the internet variety) have raised since I came to the Forge. At one time, I would probably have been likely to post a "Here's a link, what do you think?" query. But the standards are absolutely necessary for what they're doing over there. And I don't think they're hard or unreasonable at the bottom of it: post with a purpose, ask specific questions, respond with grace and substance. Take this example. The guy A) did not read or honor the rules for that forum, stated clearly and succinctly: "If you're starting a thread here, then it's very important for you to make specific inquiries and to raise specific points - don't post a ton of material and ask "what do you think," because it won't help much" and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Being asked to tell them something more specific about his game, it took a couple of passes before he got to something sorta-specific (at which point he got feedback), and even then he still doesn't say anything about how the game works. He wasn't asked to live up to a bunch of impossible standards or read and digest a metric ton of Theory, or drowned in jargon. He was just engaged as helpfully as possible, and it didn't take. It's too bad, but I don't see how his perspective (feeling "ripped on," etc) is especially valid.<br/><br/>I know you haven't yet weighed in on whether the "problem" should be fixed, but <i>do</i> you have an opinion on how James and Joshua could have handled things differently in that thread? What would non-off-putting-to-newcomers Forge dialogue, in your view, look like?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>OK, looking back, I can see what you were going for (though the post did<i>start</i>with discussion of theory jerks, not well-intentioned-misguided-approach-theory-guys). </blockquote>
Well, the opening post suggests that there aren't (many) people behaving badly in the name of theory and that it's pretty much all ad hominim attacks by theory-haters. So it's not clear what, if anything would be broadly acknowledged as bad behavior by "theorists" in this thread (and who are they? Everyone on this board? Everyone with a named theory? Everyone who believes some aspect of GNS? We don't even know that).<br/><br/>In these terms, the original post is both indeterminant and impossible to address. If some posts that have been viewed as widely offensive by people who'd probably fall in the "theorist" category aren't seen as bad-behavior (and I'll reluctantly offer up the Brain Damage thing as an example) then it poses the question of what, if anything, a potential "theory zealot" might do to give people a negative impression of RPG theory.<br/><br/>While I'm sure that most people wouldn't claim nothing *ever* has been done in the discussion of RPG theory, if the general feeling is that there's zero reason whatsoever for any rational person to get a negative vibe from some of the prominent discussions, then I would say that by the same reasoning (albeit on the other side) applies to anyone who says that 'anti-theorists' (who are they? Maybe JimBob--but, you know, when I read him, he talks like a theorist ... same for the pundit ... within his limited sphere of discussion) who might say they are simply reacting to offensive stuff 'theorists' say.<br/><br/>So long as everyone is happy with the dialog it's fine to assume that all the negativity in theory discussions come from some anti-theorists who are on a rampage against right-thinking theorists (or that all all the negativity comes from evil theorists who are interested in destroying the hobby or whatever nonsense you want to suggest) but it sure won't fix problems of the negativity.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            This conversation seems like a lot of what the media does these days, analyzing itself for how it affects other things like politics.<br/>
<br/>
I think that everyone involved is human, and that everyone has failed at one time or another. Except for Levi - all praise the most high priest of honest communication! Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I'm fortunate enough to be both obtuse and thick-skinned. That's not to say I haven't been drawn offsides by this in the past. But I try to keep out of it as much as possible. Because it's not something that has a solution. Saying, "Act better!" to the public isn't going to do any good, frankly. Even if you do happen to be able to prove that they're doing something wrong. Especially when they're within their civic rights to do that thing.<br/>
<br/>
The anti-intellectualism aimed at theory is not unique to RPG theory, but exists everwhere in which debate occurs. Just let it go. Give people more credit, and assume that they're seeing through the BS.<br/>
<br/>
Tony, you create a false dichotomy with the "Use my anger or swallow it and let it claw at me" statement. It is actually possible to just let things go. Take a deep breath, let it out, and let the anger go with it, and focus on something else.<br/>
<br/>
Because, in the end man, you haven't been raped. You haven't even been defamed largely. You've just been involved in some heated debates.<br/>
<br/>
Marco, despite being wrong about a lot of things (I kid, because I love), has always been an earnest debater. If he's using radical tactics to make his point, he's doing nothing more than Ron does with "brain damage" and "child abuse." I actually think that both Ron and Marco are fine using this tactic, but, then, I know both of them. That is, it doesn't offend me in the least, but I completely understand why it inflames others.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think they do it intentionally. I use such tactics occasionally, but I'm timid in comparison to Ron and Marco here. Probably.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, Marco is no Pundit (for better or worse). :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, anyhow, this comes up once in a while, usually in reverse, starting with "Forgies are uncomfortable making people!" And, in the end, it always seems to boil down to the same thing. I have to apollogize for being an asshole, and make the specious claim that I'll try to do better (apparently I haven't improved).<br/>
<br/>
So, OK, sorry to have been a bastard, and I'll do better next time.<br/>
<br/>
There. Now hopefully somebody on the other side will feel better?<br/>
<br/>
No?<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the moment of solipsism. But I see a lot of effort and angst happening here, and all I keep thinking is that it's not doing a lot of good. Sometimes there just is no solution.<br/>
<br/>
But that's OK, things are pretty good. No worse than they were yesterday, at least.<br/>

                            My personal take on the "theorists are all zealots" meme and (perhaps more directly) the "theorists don't actually play" meme. This is going to get long and rambly...<br><br>Roleplaying is a really weird hobby. It's totally ephemeral, and totally contained within the heads of the participants at the moment they engage with it. It's a purely anecdotal hobby, a slightly more structured way of hanging out with a bunch of your mates. The experience of participating in a roleplaying game is utterly personal and utterly subjective. Afterwards, you remember very little of the *specifics* of the event, you only remember the general impression. You remember that your character fought the villain and won (or that you made a profound point about the nature of sacrifice, depending on your tastes) you probably don't remember exactly what was said between the people at the table, or exactly what led up to your making a particular in-character decision.<br><br>To put it another way, Roleplaying games are a medium with no text. When you read a poem, your experience of it is purely subjective, and you can never know what somebody else experiences when they read the same poem, but you *can* give them a copy of the poem you read, and get them to read it. Sharing your experience of a roleplaying game is much, much harder. It's like trying to explain a poem to somebody without being able to use any of the actual lines.<br><br>What this comes down to is that it is virtually impossible to find any common ground between your experience and the experience of another roleplayer who has not actually been in the same game as you. And what *that* means is that it is very easy to characterise other people as "never actually playing", because they may very well never have had the experience which you consider to be a roleplaying game.<br><br>Take, as an example, the recent discussion about Force, in which more than one person (myself included) read the definition of what "Force" was and said to themselves (in so many words) "but nothing like that would ever actually *happen* in a game". It's not just a miscommunication, it's a genuine gulf in experience: your games are nothing like my games are nothing like his games. A common problem for you will be a non-issue for me (indeed it may be something I can't even imagine).<br><br>To cut a long story short, what winds up happening is that Joe Theorist will talk about How Games Work, and Dave Non-Theorist will say to himself "this is completely alien to my experience, this guy must be making it up." And that then becomes "this guy must be making it up because he has a *sinister agenda* to *destroy roleplaying*"<br><br>Or something.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

This is very true, but I'm not sure that Theory is the relevant dividing line. I think there's a huge disjoint in people's subjective Roleplaying experiences <i>across the hobby</i>, whether two disparate experiences belong to theorists or non-theorists, or whatever. Perhaps usage of theory terms (in their attempt to codify and define certain RP experiences) serves to <i>highlight</i> the differences in peoples' experience more clearly.<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

I think you get two major accusations, you get the "you guys never actually *play* games" accusations and you get the "you guys aren't actually playing RPGs, you're playing some kind of froofy am-dram thing" accusations. I'd argue that both of these have their roots in the enormous disjunction between the experiences of different groups of roleplayers. Most gamers have never played what most other gamers would consider a roleplaying game.

That's true, but to be honest that accusation is, in a large part, general gamer asshattery. I've also heard people insist that Living Greyhawk isn't a roleplaying game, because you don't "roleplay" as they would understand it. And there's the famous RPGnet thread where some guy insisted that Ars Magica wasn't a roleplaying game because it didn't have an equipment list.

Oh I think that's absolutely true, but I think the presence of Theory aggravates the problem, because it's *supposed* to be universal.                        </div>

I think there's a lot of merit behind this; theory tends to be formed (at least, I hope it is) based on actual experiences. The problem is that these experiences are usually quite limited, usually to the experiences of the person or persons who develope the theory. The theory that forms is fine; it's just that the experiences it's based on are a very small subset of what roleplaying is considered to be. Observing or participating in lot of gaming helps to expand it - a bit.<br><br>Another problem is that theories tend to produce some kind of Best Practises solutions (could be games, could be Tips and Tricks for GM's, or whatever) which are again based on small set of experiences. They rarely match to other people's experiences - some of it does, but not all. And since theory and applications are based on the small subset of experiences that have made roleplaying better for some people, somewhere... You're stading quite near of My Way, The Best Way -preaching, even with good intentions. And this aggravates people.<br><br>If there would be a really universal theory of roleplaying, I'd bet that it would be painted on so broad strokes that getting practical applications out of it would be... Very demanding.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

That's partly how I got interested in this stuff originally. I had a group blow up, talked to different people about what had happened, and you literally would not have believed that these two people had been in the same room, doing the same activity, once a week for 2 years.                        </div>

This is very true. I'd see this as a facet (or subset, or whatever) of the general idea that people's gaming experiences diverge in the first place. But you're right that it can diverge even for two people <i>in the same room</i> and <i>playing the same game.</i> And that can be very powerful indeed.<br><br>Had a blowup in my group recently (I was the blow-upper, in fact) which turned out was caused by, among other things, vastly different ideas of what was going down and why. And after a long and arduous group talk about it, I <i>still</i> don't really understand where the other guy's coming from. I can <i>sorta, almost</i> formulate it abstractly. But it's completely alien to me. And I gather from his responses that he doesn't really understand why I felt the way I did, either.<br><br/>So yeah. A pretty powerful factor. Thanks for highlighting it.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </br></br></br></div>
