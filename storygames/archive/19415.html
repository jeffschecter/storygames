The instructions for installing it on Vanilla are <a href="http://tapatalk.com/activate_tapatalk.php?plugin=van" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's an app for reading and responding on forums via your phone, and it's particularly good if you participate in multiple forums.<br/><br/>Of course, I am very thankful that Story Games exists, and I realize that it is maintained and moderated by people volunteering their time with no financial compensation. So this is not, I hope, an over-entitled demand, but just a polite request for the powers that be to consider this as and when they feel like it / have time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
