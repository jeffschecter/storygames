Even taking aside things like materials costs, which I've never used anyways (I mean, 1000gp for Passwall?  WTF.), because they key on a resource that's not mechanically regulated, rituals are amazingly not fun.

They make sense to me.  If you're getting more-or-less the right amount of gold per encounter, the component cost is little more than a speed-bump, saying "don't do this all day every day".  I don't think the game would fall apart if you removed that though.<br/><br/>The reasoning for the rituals is pretty straightforward: Given a choice between spells that are fun but rarely useful, and spells that are actually good in combat, people will choose the combat spells every time.  Rituals, which benefit the whole group mostly, remove that false choice - now you get both.  <br/><br/>I think the choices of which is which make sense to me too.  Mordenkanian's Mansion is a daily power because it's useful in combat - it lets the entire party rest for eight hours and come back to the fight fresh - if they can make it to the door's square.  Comprehend Languages, while it could be useful in combat, is a Ritual because most of the time you're not going to use it in combat, and you'd choose almost any power instead of it.<br/><br/>I've seen complaints about specific rituals that make sense to me - Silence is just a perception penalty, and Knock only unlocks doors, rather than busting them open.  I can get used to those differences though, and there's no reason not to create your own rituals that do more powerful things at higher levels.  I'm expecting to see a lot of suppliments including extra rituals.  That's the biggest advantage of rituals, in my opinion.  Because they're never used in combat, I think it's much easier to create new rituals without unbalancing the game.  Because rituals could concievably do anything, it makes magic feel much more magical.  There's the counterargument that it was cool when every magical effect came from a specific appliction of a known spell, and I'm sympathetic to that, but the suppliment bloat in 3e kind of destroyed that anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151773/#Comment_151773" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T23:01:46+00:00" title="June 19, 2008 11:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Remove the cost; it's either a waste of valuable resources if you've got gold on a tight leash, or a non-cost if the players actually follow the game's incentives and begin stripping everything bare of all wealth. <br/><br/>2) Open up the 3.5 PHB<br/><br/>3) Find spells that can actually affect the world in a meaningful and lasting way.

A lot of it is arbitrary, but I think in a good way.<br/><br/>Gold pieces are a real in game resource in D&amp;D.  You only have so many and spending them is part of play.  1000 gp for the right application of passwall at the right time can be an awesome investment in terms of game winning power.  Imagine using that to bypass a real gauntlet the party would have to run, or to completely change the tactical layout of an encounter.  It can be huge.  There's a door that can only be opened by a certain key that will be both costly and dangerous to get?  Maybe we should skip that side quest and stay on track as far as defeating the big boss goes.  Passwall!<br/><br/>1000 gp could be a bargain.<br/><br/>Or were you saying 1000 gp was too cheap?<br/><br/>I would also say that gold pieces are somewhat mechanically regulated.  The amount of them you get is based on the number of encounters you successfuly overcome.  Check the DMG about how to give treasure and you'll see they're directly linked to overcoming encounters just like XP are.  XP help you level up to become better at overcoming encounters and GP can be spent on things with a similar goal in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151788/#Comment_151788" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T03:20:02+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  3:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see why having to pay for rituals would be annoying; I can't myself get the gold economy of D&amp;D; to work at all, it being such a pain in the ass to have to choose between being all "realistic" and paying for all kinds of non-combat effective things (food, lodging and heroic charity endeavours, say), or optimising characters by selling their pants to buy a better magic weapon. Having the extremely tightly regulated 4th edition treasure scheme further imbalanced by players wasting money in small trickles in rituals (that are not, as far as I can see, factored as an expense in the DMG treasure and adventure design guidelines) only compounds the contrast between the regulated in-flow and unregulated outflow of gold.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have a solution to the problem, though.

The gap narrows in the mid levels (a tenth level character can use 12.5 rituals for the same cost as a tenth level magic sword), but then widens dramatically at high levls (58 "True Portals" for the cost of a 28th level item).  Bear in mind that generally characters are using items above their level, and that you're only going to be using a small number of rituals in the time it takes to go up a level.  At first level, you'd get 14 rituals if you spent all of one character's gold income on rituals, not counting magic items - that's more than one ritual per encounter.<br><br>The component cost for rituals is just there to say "don't use these without thinking about it - only use them when it's cool."

Both are rather rotten outcomes in that they're extra work when the system could have easily been made self-balancing as well. (Of course, a self-balancing ritual system would really just remove a minor part of my own wealth leeching problematics - the modern D&amp;D; system of using WBL guidelines simply breaks down horribly if you allow characters to spend their money on anything but combat effectiveness. I myself seem to need an average of 1.5 sessions before my character gets an idea involving buying an orphanage, tavern or castle with his ill-gotten gains, or something of the sort - might just waste it all on vine and women, retire on the profits or give it away to the people it was stolen from, who knows. So you might say that the money management system in modern D&amp;D;, focused on channeling lucre into new magic items, really isn't doing it for me. The ritual system is just a minor annoyance on top of that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I do kinda like an implication the rituals have: with rituals being decoupled from combat powers of character classes, it becomes pretty trivial to take the decoupling to the logical conclusion and remove all implied connections between a character's combat class and his out-of-combat occupation. All that's needed really seems to be to remove class-based skill lists and some minor fiddling for edge cases. Fiction-wise, it seems to me that there'd be some rather interesting possibilities in having a "Fighter" who is actually an arcanist with fighter combat powers, for example - and that's whether you describe it as the fighter just being a scholar of the arcane, or the character being some sort of wizard who just happens to use fighter crunch on top of his fluff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting question is why rituals are all just dull magic - I'd have kinda expected that if somebody bothered to have this kind of rules-system, he'd include all kinds of fun non-magical "rituals" as well. Having a ritual for putting together a safari with the bargaining skill (whatever it's called) would be interesting and useful, for example. Actually, I think that I'd probably need to go through the ritual list with a pen if I were ever to run an extended campaign of the game - I'd want to get rid of the high-fantasy stuff I don't like so much, adding in the cool stuff that inexplicably didn't make the cut. I'd also make up some guidelines for slotting skill challenges into rituals - it's pretty strange that rituals, which could be rather big deals fiction-wise, are handled without particularly detailed rules-contact.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't remember off-hand whether this already was in the ritual chapter, mind, but one simple thing I'd probably do with it would be to have characters buy the ritual equipment in advance - so instead of just burning abstract gold whenever you wanted a ritual, you'd have to at least go into town and buy whatever components the ritual required. This'd also make the ritual thing a bit more worthwhile as a logistical challenge, as you'd need to try to figure out beforehand which rituals you might want to cast in the dungeon, and how many of each. Make rituals inventory items, in effect, like scrolls used to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my thoughts on rituals, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151802/#Comment_151802" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T05:36:08+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  5:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 5:38AM by Rob Donoghue.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The cost issue has no one fix, since it depends a lot upon the GM's approach to money in a particular campaign.  That said, in D&amp;D money really _is_ mechanically regulated, at least as written.  You can discard that in favor of an economy that makes more sense,  and many do, but the existing system puts a lot of thought into how much money players get and how much they have to spend. <br><br>That said, I've considered the following house rules:<br>* Players have a kit of supplies of a specific type (Nature, arcana, etc) with a specific GP value.  So long as the value of the kit is greater than the cost of the ritual, they can use it.  Casting a ritual uses up 10% of its cost from the value of the kit.<br><br>* Magic Items and Ritual Items contribute a permanent value to your ritual pool, effectively providing a discount.  Having the shield of St. Cuthbert might count for 400g towards any religious ritual, but not be expended with use.   These items might be rare and powerful (in which case they should be storied) or common but weak (resulting in wizards carrying stacks of crap - some people dig that)<br><br>* Allow Skill Challenges to reduce the cost by sending the rest of the party off to scrounge, beg, borrow or steal components.  This depends on either a creative ritualist or an amusing table to random needs, but it might be fun to figure out what skill check they'll use to get a virgin's tears. I am personally fond of this one, but have not yet done the math for it.<br><br/>* Make ritual spellbooks bigger, much bigger, and require large, expensive accoutrement's.  In doing so, you basically force rituals to be something done back in town, with a bag of holding meaning you can bring the apparatus for one or two along. That then makes the price to cast into the price to pay an NPC to cast the ritual.  Now add a feat that allows a player to internalize a ritual (I'd say treat them like languages, three per feat) and make internalized rituals take just as much time, but require many fewer ingredients, just chalk and string and bits on hand.   The only drawback to internalized feats is that they use a bit of the character's will to smooth over the details, so casting such a ritual costs a healing surge.<br/><br/>* The rituals in the book are the ones you can find in Rituals for Dummies.  Better, cheaper, more potent versions exist, but they tend to be in lich filled libraries and ancient goblin temples.  If only there were adventurers around!<br/><br/>Rituals are a great dial in my mind, so I admit I'm all for fiddling with them. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont" title="chaldfont"><img alt="chaldfont" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont">chaldfont</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151810/#Comment_151810" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T06:12:30+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  6:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dig rituals. Essentially, I did the same thing, though with hand waving rather than formal rules, in previous editions of D&amp;D. It's nice to see it formalized now.<br/><br/>In my last big D&amp;D campaign, it ended with the party sorcerer agreeing to help the arch-villain perform a major ceremony to bind a group of doppelganger assassins that had been making trouble all over the kingdom. The PC knew that the arch-villain was going to pervert the ceremony into one that would make him a lich (and sacrifice the PC in the process) at the last minute. So the PC did the research to figure out how to double-double-cross the villain and change the ritual so HE would be come a lich and bind the doppelgangers at the same time.<br/><br/>This plot would have been easily handled with 4e rituals and skill challenges. As it was, we kind of hacked it with a bunch of opposed Know (Arcana) checks, but the new rules would have made it much more of a "mental chess game" encounter.<br/><br/>A ritual is an excuse to let any magical effect into the game without worrying about balance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151816/#Comment_151816" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T07:02:12+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  7:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My biggest problem with rituals is that many of them that supposedly can't be used in combat, can.

My understanding from several sources is that many of the spells that were converted to rituals or in some cases dumbed down (silence going from a standard action to taking 100 rounds to cast and it doesn't make things silent, only gives a -10 perception check) was much less an organizational decision and more a "let's get rid of all the stuff that would create unpredictable results in combat and thus potentially unbalance the underlining resource game but many of these spells are D&amp;D tropes so don't drop them but let us neuter them in every way possible to make sure no one can utilize them in normal combat."

That's the equivalent of 12th level in 4e.  So there's a big gap, but not as big as it first seems.

So it's not as sucky as it appears.<br/><br/>I'm quibbling, but...<br/><br/>By your conversion, L24 is equivalent to L16 in 3.X, and the difference between L16 and L7 (when you can first cast a L4 spell) is, well, pretty big.  Plus, they still get a perception check to notice and then a contest to destroy the sensor.  In both cases, the spell is still essentially useless, because it takes a _hour_ to cast and you can watch for _rounds_ (to a maximum of 5 rounds with a 40+ Arcana check in 4e).  30secs of observation every hour is absurd.  The chances of you catching them doing something revealing are miniscule.  And, besides, it doesn't matter: if the DM doesn't want you to know about something he can always have the bad guy throw up a Forbiddance first.  There is no chance that it will 'ruin' your adventure if you don't want it to.<br/><br/>That sauce is so weak, I'm not even sure there is any sauce at all.<br/><br/>This is particularly interesting, given that in almost every other case except the divination rituals, spells are available to approximately the same level of caster as in 3.X, no 'conversion' needed, and often at quite a bit lower level.  Despite this, they haven't really let themselves off the leash and allowed characters to do things on a much larger scale than in the previous editions, where there was a tendency to reduce the scale specifically to the tactical.<br/><br/>My standard for what I want to see with rituals is pretty simple.  When I look at them I want to see some things that are useful for the players and some things which give me ideas for villains.  Put a 'blowing up volcano' ritual in the book and my first reaction is, "Hey, I can make an adventure around that."  I just loathe games where the players are not allowed to do cool stuff, and 4e is in two minds about that.  The players kick all kinds of ass in combat, but out of combat they don't have very many abilities to affect things on a large scale.  Skill tests can be used for that, but that depends on the DM.  But the rituals are where they bottle it.  I'm disappointed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
