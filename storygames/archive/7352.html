We used the sample scenario in the book; I played John Hobson, the young rival to the local cattle baron Harry McDougal, and Susie played Delia, his sister (and the local newspaper publisher) who was madly in love with the cattle baron's son Jake. Classic Romeo and Juliet stuff, with guns and cowboys all around.<br/><br/>The story begins with Jake getting back from a cattle drive, walking into her newspaper office and brazenly asking Delia to come visit him in the saloon. I say brazenly because their relationship is supposed to be a secret. She's nervous about what this could mean (hoping for a marriage proposal), but she agrees. On his way out of the office, Jake runs into John and they get into a bit of a scuffle. John's a bit softer than Jake and gets knocked to the ground quickly. When Jake leaves, John takes his sister into the office and berates her for associating with their enemy. She tells him that they were planning a meeting between him and Harry (the father), and somehow convinces him to go with her that evening.<br/><br/>The meeting is a disaster; neither Harry or John actually wanted to be there, and although Delia is there (dressed very nicely for a proposal...), Jake never shows up. Harry offers to buy up all of the Hobson's property, but John doesn't accept. McDougal's thugs hold him down and beat on him a bit for good measure, but Delia humiliates Harry and cows him into leaving. John suddenly believes that this meeting was a distraction, and rushes back to his property to make sure that it isn't being messed with by Jake. Delia runs to the McDougal House looking for Jake, but he's not there.<br/><br/>On the way to his property, John here's a big disturbance and realizes it's coming from the newspaper shop. He gets there to see more thugs trashing the place and shoots one in the gut just before he burns the place down. The other thugs run off, but the place is a mess. John decides to go to the McDougal home and extract reparation money.<br/><br/>Delia discovers her shop in a mess and her assistant tells her what happened. She is too worried about what happened with Jake, so she leaves the shop in his hands and goes to the stables to see if Jake has taken his horse anywhere. Meanwhile, John storms into the McDougal home, which sends the housekeeper running for the sheriff. No one else is there. He takes two rifles with in-laid gold and leaves before any trouble comes looking. Back at the stable, Delia discovers that Harry sent his son away from her. Emotionally distraught and filled with anger at Harry, she goes up to the house, still empty, and sets the library on fire.<br/><br/>John makes his way home with the rifles and sits down to think about what has happened. The sheriff and some deputies come calling; it seems that the McDougal home has been burned fairly badly, and John was the last person anyone saw there. Worse, he has stolen rifles shot a man in the gut, so they have evidence enough to arrest him. While this happens, Delia starts phase two of her plan to destroy McDougal; she and her assistant stay up all night printing up thousands of copies of a news page that goes into detail about how horrible Harry is and the terrible things he has done. Even when McDougal discovers the page, there is no way to stop it or collect all of the copies...<br/><br/>When Delia discovers John has been arrested, she comes into the jail and convinces the sheriff that the shooting was in self-defense and that they have no real evidence against him in the case of the fire. Reluctantly and only half-convinced, the sheriff lets him go.<br/><br/>Out on the street, they meet a torn-down Harry McDougal, a man who's lost his house, his reputation, and has almost nothing left. John says "This is what happens when you mess with the Hobsons," and makes a final offer to buy him out. McDougal relents, and signs the papers on the spot with the sheriff as a witness. Delia asks Harry where Jake is. He refuses to say, but she leans in and whispers "Houses burn as easily in Dallas as they do in Abilene..." revealing to him and only him that she was the source of all his troubles. He has nothing left and leaves town, cowed yet again by Delia.<br/><br/>Epilogue: John gives the house and land to Delia. The crew digging through the mess discovers a box in the library and gives it to Delia. Inside is a diamond engagement ring. She becomes even more broken, and spends the rest of her life looking for Jake, but is never able to find him.<br/><br/>I'll talk about my thoughts in in the next post.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163343/#Comment_163343" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T13:38:48+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  1:38PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2008 1:42PM by dyjoots.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dust Devils is Susie's favorite RPG by far, and I like it quite a bit as well. Once again, it delivers an emotionally engaging story and complex, dark characters.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the game was when Delia went into the McDougal home, still wearing the dress from earlier that evening (but now completely torn up and muddied), and burned the house down. It was absolutely terrible; you could feel this girl's need for revenge and her sadness about Jake. Plus, it was a completely unexpected move from a character that otherwise used words to get her way.<br/><br/>We had no issues with the mechanics at all*... well, only one character came to The End (Harry) but the story seemed to follow such a perfect arc that even though the game ran short, we finished satisfied. There were times where I felt like I maybe should be calling for a conflict, but I couldn't remember exactly how that worked, and I was probably being overly careful since I overdo it in some games.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Well, you know, Matt <i>was</i> there. He did have to reference the book a couple of times (:-O), but that only made me feel more comfortable with the fact that I have to do it, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sujihime" title="sujihime"><img alt="sujihime" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sujihime">sujihime</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163393/#Comment_163393" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T16:03:00+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  4:03PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi.  I'm Susie, the wife.  Chris is absolutely right when he says Dust Devils is my favorite game.  It really is.  When I was at Gencon, some people asked me "why is Dust Devils your favorite game?"  I just kinda hemmed and hawed and mumbled something about dark characters. That's not why, but it was the only thing I could think of.  So I sat down and gave it a thought.<br/><br/>First of all, let me say two things about myself.  First, I don't consider myself a gamer.  Gaming is my husband's hobby.  I enjoy it, but it's not really my thing as much as his.  When we were living abroad, I was his gaming group (poor fellow) so I learned a lot about games.  Secondly, my background isn't in Fantasy like most role-players.  I am an avid reader of romance novels and I adore "chick" movies.  This influences the way I play a little bit.  I hope that's not weird to say, but I wanted people to know where I'm coming from when I play.  It's not epic swashbuckling fantasy or super-tech science-fiction.  It's bodice wearing women and the daring menfolk who love them.<br/><br/>Dust Devils is my favorite game.  The fact that the characters have a dark side to them fascinate me and I believe that was the reason I gave for liking DD so much at Gencon.  But if I <i>just</i> wanted dark characters I could play WoD.  It doesn't get much angstier than bloodsucking fiends.  However, WoD isn't my cuppa.  Not only are the characters dark, but their devils tend to make them fueled by their emotions.  And the more emotional they get, the more their devil tends to override them and they start spiraling out of control.  It's crazy and wonderful!  Here, you don't just have a dark character who is a crappy person, you have a character with some depth who seems to be stuck in a tailspin.  Can they overcome their darker nature and pull out and live happily ever after? Probably not.  You just get to sit back and watch their tragedy.  I don't know if any of that makes sense...but it excites me.  Romance novels tend to dwell on emotional scenes and powerful imagery.  DD seems to recreate that quite well.<br/><br/>This game was awesome for me.  I really got into my character, Delia.  Even though I didn't create her and my character sheet was sparse (compared to more trad character sheets) I felt I "clicked" with her persona.  Devil: Know-it All.  Pretty as a picture, Sassy as a songbird.  Used to be a eastern lady, now a newspaper publisher.  That was it, but that told me everything I needed.<br/><br/>Two of my favorite parts of the game where when Delia burned down the house (as Chris mentioned) and when she destroyed McDougal with her paper.  The house burning was epic!  It actually went against Delia's nature AND devil, but she was over-wrought.  I scored several chips/tokens for it and lost cards.  Despite that, I still managed to have a better hand than Matt (the GM).  So the house was burned and Delia was beautiful in her fury.   It was MAGNIFICENT.  <br/><br/>The destroying McDougal with her paper conflict was awesome.  Not only did Delia strike a blow to the heart of McDougal by harming his rep, she did a LOT of harm.  Turns out, four aces is an incredibly excellent hand and beats all but a straight flush and royal straight flush.  It basically ripped McDougal to shreds and got him far enough down that John was able to make a deal with him and drive him from town.  Truly awesome.  Who knew you could fight with a paper instead of fists?  <br/><br/>Anyways, I had a lot of fun with the game.  It was just 2 hours, but that's all that was really needed (plus I have a short attention span).  Matt ran an excellent game and it was exciting to play a game with the author/designer.  It was nice that he seemed to enjoy himself as well.  When we first sat down to play, I felt as if we were monopolizing his con time, but by the end he seemed to enjoy himself and not mind.  <br/><br/>So those are my thoughts on the game.  I hope it all made sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163476/#Comment_163476" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T19:20:37+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  7:20PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris and Susie are really doing the actual play justice here. This short-but-bittersweet session (that's a good thing!) was the most effective play for me at that con. Oh, I had so much fun playing 3:16 and The Shadow of Yesterday. But, this tight little game quietly stole the show on the last day of the con.<br/><br/>There's little I can add, except to say that this was one of the tightest, most emotional games of Dust Devils I've ever played. And, I especially liked it because of Susie's jaw-dropping and amazing play. (Hey, Chris was no slouch! Don't mess with his tough, greedy character!) <br/><br/>Dust Devils is most rewarding to me when people do things that surprise me AND do things that make the story better than any idea I had myself. Susie knocked Chris and I out with not only her portrayal of Delia, but her gut-punching avenger choices. Burning the rival's house down was THE turning point to a great game. And, my impression of your play was that you did it very naturally, "just playing your character." That's a thing that works well in Dust Devils that sometimes gets overlooked. Dramatic play like this comes pretty naturally from choices that players "just know" they need to make. Turns out, they're right of course.<br/><br/>No doubt about it, I enjoyed myself! Playing with you and Chris was a real treat for me. You were both excellent players, and I have a real fondness for the story we all created together.<br/><br/>I think there was a sequel in there somewhere. As Chris indicates, neither main character reached The End. I was amazed how tightly the story wrapped up despite that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
