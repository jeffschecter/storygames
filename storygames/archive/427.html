<p>I was thinking back on the Big Damn Immersion discussion, and a sticking point comes to mind: isn't Immersion just reflected at the player level, in their own experience in the game? So long as other players are not messing with someone else's attempts to immerse/not-immerse, and so long as we're all still enjoying the stuff in play, then it's all good - we're just using different techniques (immersion / not-immersion) to process it ourselves.</p>
<p>This is cool to me, because while don't care as much for immersing, this shouldn't stop me playing with people who are really big on that - so long as what we want doesn't interfere. That last bit can be tricky, but can be navigated. (And this isn't just hypothetical, but me thinking about optimizing play with people I know.)</p>

                            Dev, <br/><br/>My interest in immersion has (historically) been focused around that "last bit." <br/><br/>You are right that it can be done, but to do so optimally and in the most possible situations you do have to understand what is going on with the other people at the table, at least in a basic way. <br/><br/>Including the fact that not all their immersions are the same immersion. <br/><br/>So, "yes" and "that's what I've been getting at" and then "So what methods do you use in order to mix the folks with different sockets at your table?"                        </div>

<p>I think I may have misread some comments (maybe not yours?) of trying to partition those interests from non-immersion ones, whereas I just realized that they can be compatible. So maybe this is just an "ah..." post.</p>
<p>Well, here's an example of how my thinking is going. I want (for example): clear Conflict Resolution, rather than Task Resolution. Friend wants: not to break character to talk about what the players want, if possible. Therefore, I should choose a game where the system that can resolve conflicts and their stakes <em>without</em> requiring us to cobble together stakes OOC.</p>

                            Dev,<br/><br/>Yea, that's something I've been thinking too. <br/><br/>Problem is that without the players having imput into the stakes in a clear and honest way a lot of the strength of stakes-resolution goes away. You need some way for people to be able to clearly communicate what they want out of the game, and it takes a lot of skill to be able to do that without the person telling you what they want. <br/><br/>At one point I'd talked to Shreyas about using his mudras system to guide narration without having to break flow -- but I don't know how that would go for immersionists, as they still have to have part of their brain thinking outside character. I know Mo, for example, could do it, as she's quite good at multi-tasking and dual-conciousness tricks, but I'm not sure it would work for all my immersionist friends. <br/><br/>Really, I think that for a lot of immersionists taks resolution seems easiest and most natural because it seems to allow them to approach a challange the way their character would. (It doesn't actually, but appearance is important.) So, perhaps if the stakes were kept to what the character wants -- clear declerations of intent on the character's part without going to the level of what the player wants? It screws up a lot of authorship modes, but hell, a lot of authorship modes are screwed up by whatever system you use.<br/><br/><br/>Edit: As for me and immersionists -- I'm not one. But at least half the people I play with are, and are very good players. Sometimes, however, our styles and agendas do lead to clash and so I'm always interested in finding ways to minimize it.                        </div>

                            I have always felt that task-resolution is (as Brand says) optimal for immersion. The keys are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1. The GM and players should be in synch as to what tasks will accomplish what objective. Often it's (IME) pretty clear what is wanted--sometimes it isn't though. As a GM I will usually talk with the player about what I think the outcomes of an action will be before the dice are rolled. <br/>
<br/>
2. The case where you "do everything right" and it "still doesn't work" (the most common example I have seen being breaking into a safe to "get the goods" on someone and the safe being empty).<br/>
<br/>
I think this is actually fine for most immersionists so long as the situation is not completely furstrating. In a Conflict Res system either the goods would be in the safe or something else would happen to yield the character getting a good outcome (the safe is empty but the phone in the target's office rings and an incriminating message is left). <br/>
<br/>
In an immersive game, this outcome is still pretty valid if it matches up to other priorities (i.e. it's way more "dramatic" than "realistic" and if getting the goods is understood by the participants as a *challenge* then using a poor approach should yield poor results).<br/>
<br/>
However, outside of these two caveats, I don't see a whole lot of difference in the execution of actions, just in the mind-set of the person taking them (the person who sets up a conflict is certain what's at stake--the person who tries a bunch of tasks and sees what happens can't be sure).<br/>
<br/>
Hence, I think that so long as other priorities align, there should be no reason for discord between people in a system who want to immerse and those who don't.<br/>

<p>This is going back to the "Conflict Resolution for Immersionists" thread, but: here's a hypothetical for Conflict Resolution compatible with (some forms of) Immersionism. Suppose we have a Task resolution system that's basically roll a d10 under your Task Number to see if you succeed. We let the GM roll the die, but only for convenience (rather than fudging or anything like that).</p>
<p>If there is a larger Conflict going on, there's some chart the GM can reference to see that X successes or X failures are needed to finally resolves those stakes, and each Task Resolution roll devoted to the larger Conflict accumulates successes / failures towards that final resolution, and the GM will not describe a resolution of the conflict until the threshold is hit. Tricky part: who sets the stakes in this Conflict Resolution system? The GM does - but he pays very careful attention to what the players are intending / flagging so he knows stakes to keep in mind. The players should have some IC / RP techniques to help make clear what kinds of stakes they want (without saying so explicitly), while the system should have something allowing for stakes to change ad hoc, since stakes tend to drift especially when they're not tightly defined.</p>
<p>This is a kind of mechanic that would not require more from my friend, in terms of consciously interfacing with the system in a meta / OOC way, but it would also satisfy me knowing that there was CR underlying what was going on in the game. If we found a GM who was cool enough to read us that well, then I think this would be fantastic for both of us.</p>

                            See, the thing I had with FATE when I first found it was that I read it at exactly the same time I was reading HeroQuest. Because of that I didn't give FATE its full due, and its only with some more time (and a mild amount of disillusionment with HQ) that I've been able to give FATE its due.                        </div>

                            I'm not so familiar with FATE but isn't TSoY similar with Bring Down the Pain? I kind of assume that most people around here know the game better than I do, but maybe that's not the case? Anyway, TSoY looks like it'd work, too, since IIRC you don't have to agree to overall stakes--you just have to state <i>your</i> character's intention.                        </div>

                            Spycraft? <br/><br/>Maybe... but not the type of character immersion most of my play group goes for. Spycraft is very goal-oriented and complete the mission centered. I suppose that you could immerse durring that, but I don't know that it's that friendly too it. <br/><br/>Or.. wait.. do you mean in the thread about stakes resolution? In that context, yea... I could see it. In that context SC2.0 has a task resolution system in which each task is carefully and fully defined, and so there is much less of the usual "roll until you get the result the GM wants you to have" type of badness. You know exactly what each roll means, and have systems for larger conflicts (chases and the like) that pace out the conflict as a whole. <br/><br/>Though I don't know if the conflict systems would be as immersion friendly... they do require you to chose strategies and play action type cards. I don't think they're as unfriendly as, say, Heroquest APs -- but maybe not as smooth as FATE.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>TSOY is okay for it. The sakes setting in it is usually smooth enough, but when you Bring Down the Pain things can get iffy if people aren't willing to work together to figure out what the results mean. Unlike a lot of task resolution systems, TOSY doesn't define the specifics of what happens -- it only defines the outcome of whatever actions you took. As a result you end up spending some time interpreting results to get the actions. <br/><br/>Though, if the group was willing to let the GM have prime focus in such interpretation, it could work. I just get itchy about doing that because I'm still trying to get over my railroady GM instincts, and that kind of power would send me back to the dark side.                        </div>
