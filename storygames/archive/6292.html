Is Konish really out and gone or is he dead but still "active" as IAWA allows if he's on the owe list etc. (now as the force of his curse, his ghost, the verminous swarm etc. - I can see Sandy as a verminous swarm-curse, and I mean that in the best "you bring awesome to game" way).<br/><br/>How often were people negotiating vs taking/insisting on the damage?  I'm interested in seeing in IAWA games how often people compromise (avoid damage to dice) vs "stand firm and conceed nothing in the fiction, so take damage, and force another conflict" or "insist on inflicting damage".  Per my post on forge/lumpley forum (no responses alas), I was struck by a recent game that bucked what had been trend of "negotiate away damage" and left characters very dice-damaged.<br/><br/>Did people have trouble with "keep it to actions that conflict, conversation doesn't" vs "social conflicts" division for IAWA that seems to come up at times?<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139414/#Comment_139414" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T13:29:36+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  1:29PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2008 7:40PM by Ry.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scenes:</b><br/>In this wicked age, night has settled over the city...<br/>In the jail, the prisoners are visited by a priest.<br/>Guarded conversation follows; the prisoners will not reveal the location of the stolen idol from the desecrated shrine.<br/>As a sign of good faith, the priest offers prayer beads... wrapped around a lockpick.<br/>Outside the jail, Konish arrives with a writ demanding the release of the prisoners.<br/>The prisoners escape and head underground.<br/>Konish blames the priest.<br/>Konish rouses more citizens to burn the priest\u2019s temple.  <br/>Konish makes a deal with Gulden to denounce Benren and Darsel, and finger them as the destroyers of the idol.<br/>Mob turns its ugly head towards the outlying village.<br/>Crinmol obtains priest\u2019s robes from Maran.<br/>Melcodin retrieves the stolen idol from where it was stashed.<br/>Darsel tries to reason with the mob<br/>Benren tries to beat Konish, fails.<br/>Crinmol goes to retrieve the idol, finds it missing.<br/>Konish begins to incite the mob to hang the family for heresy and doing away with the idol they were entrusted with.<br/>Benren begs that his family be allowed to leave in peace with their herd.<br/>Konish refuses, as the result would be too dignified.<br/>Melcodin reveals the idol, mob starts to defuse but not dissipate.<br/>Crinmol reaches the farm manor, tries to find a way to steal the idol, covers his head with the hood of the priest's robes.<br/>Melcodin claims the idol has spoken to him, and that he has come to lead the herdsmen.<br/>Crinmol's identity is challenged as he tries to approach the idol.<br/>Crinmol is seized by two priests under Gulden's direction.<br/>Crinmol tosses the lockpick and rosaries to Gulden creating even more uncertainty in the crowd.<br/>Darsel takes advantage of the confusion, plunging a knife into Konish\u2019s chest.<br/>With his dying breath, Konish lays a terrible curse upon everyone.<br/><br/><b>Recap and answers to Rob</b><br/><br/>Session ran about 3.5 hours, including arriving, introductions, pizza ordering, and a fairly long easing into / demo portion at the beginning.  With a bit of experience we'll be able to do 2 in a night, I'm sure.<br/><br/>At the end of the session Gulden's name was on the list twice, and that was all.  Konish spent his 1 Owe List occurance on dice.  Sandy may end up playing the curse later, since we added it to the deck, but who knows when that would happen.<br/><br/>People were very in favor of negotiating over taking damage, I thought.  Peter in particular favored negotiation, which helped him get on the owe list but then bow out mid-dice.  He wasn't doing this tactically - he really didn't want to lose conflicts - but it worked well for him.  As a result there was this whole "priest just caught up in events" but since the players decided that the priest hired the thieves in the first place, it left me with warm fuzzy political doublespeak feelings.<br/><br/>When Darsel stabbed Konish, that was the very first blow in what could have been a long conflict (I was rolling 12/8 versus Sandy's 12/10, I believe).  I rolled 8 and Sandy rolled 4 answering me, so this is what I said:  "You've got 2 options.  Take dice damage, or die right here, right now."  Sandy said "Oh, I totally die - Konish is such a bastard, this is perfect.  But I want to get off a curse."  I turned that over to the table and said "are we good with a curse?" (since the curse would conceivably affect everyone).  Everybody thought that was awesome.  So in plunged the knife, right to Konish's heart.  And they all lived happily ever after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139445/#Comment_139445" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T19:16:52+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  7:16PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Experimenting with styles and color a bit more:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.thestoughtons.ca/staunwark/extimages/herdsmencardfull.PNG"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139449/#Comment_139449" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T20:00:34+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  8:00PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And this one wasn't used but it's new and I like it:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.thestoughtons.ca/staunwark/extimages/mountainfortresscard.PNG"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139452/#Comment_139452" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T20:50:29+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  8:50PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>Did people have trouble with "keep it to actions that conflict, conversation doesn't" vs "social conflicts" division for IAWA that seems to come up at times?</blockquote>/realizes he didn't respond to that part<br/><br/>Actually, that wasn't a problem at all.

Hidden by a crevices and boulders, the voices of two lovers could be heard, had there been anyone there to watch.<br/><br/>Otair tries to convince Irna to leave the city - she will not abandon her father, Lemirv.<br/><br/>In the fort, Ariskal meets with his lieutenants to plan defenses.... and Otaro tries to scry that meeting... neck hairs rise and Ariskal tries to mentally force the presence from their midst (No you fucking don't see it).  <br/><br/>Otair returns to Mekado's camp - Otair is a scout, and must report to Mekado directly.  We learn from Otair's private musings that Otaro does not know of his son's abilities.  Otaro constantly berates Otair for failing to develop magical powers, but Otair has deliberately hidden them from his father, who he describes as a monster.<br/><br/>At Mekado's tent, Otair announces himself to Mekado's right-hand man and personal bodyguard, Mannak.  Mannak orders Otair inside, where he finds Mekado before a tiny fire, blood dripping down his chin and a bowl of raw meat at his fingers.  As Otair tries to give his report, Mekado shoves the bowl to Otair and grates "eat!"<br/><br/>Otair says he is not hungry, he will eat later, and again tries to give his report.  <br/><br/>Mekado strikes Otair.  "eat!"<br/><br/>Otair eats, humiliated.<br/><br/>Otair tries to bargain with Mekado, saying he can ensure swift victory - Mekado cuts him off.  Mekado orders him to give his report on the defenses.<br/><br/>Otair refuses to give the report until he has Mekado's word that Irna and her father will not be harmed. <br/><br/>Mekado swears that he will let the daughter and her father live but that Otair will die.<br/><br/>Mekado beats Otair nearly senseless.<br/><br/>When Mekado turns his back, Otair turns into a rat and escapes.  As he scurries away, Otair hears Mekado scream for his father, the wizard Otaro.<br/><br/>We see that Lemirv, father of Irna, has become the leader of a militia that reports to Ariskal.<br/><br/>Ariskal looks over the troops, does not see that Irna is returning via the crawling tunnel.<br/><br/>Trained attack dogs<br/><br/>Otair raids Otaro's tent, stealing his many talismans so Otaro's wizardry will be useless.  <br/><br/>(Otaro's meeting with Mekado, presumably, will not go as well since he can't scry).<br/><br/>Ariskal sends two of his lieutenants - Deadeye and Bora - to falsely negotiate <br/><br/>Deadeye tries to poison the food of the war-bulls<br/><br/>Shot through the back by an arrow, Deadeye keeps running<br/>Mortally wounded, Deadeye gives his report<br/><br/><i>Some issues here - Deadeye, Bora, and the archers in Mekado's camp were all treated as extensions of Ariskal's tactics and Mekado's insanity, respectively.  We decided they could dice it up by proxy - since they will experience real blowback to their capabilities (i.e. damage to forms) if either side fails.</i><br/><br/>Irna, believing Mekado's victory is inevitable and trying to make it swift, is setting up a wagon that appears to have a broken wheel at the top of the hill inside the fort.  This could be pushed towards the gate, which it would damage badly.  Ariskal sees this, and although he does not discern Irna's dangerous intentions, he does order her to move the wagon anyway.<br/><br/>Otair (still transformed into a rat) returns to the inside of fort Rennek, and finds Ariskal.  He then transforms again and is quickly surrounded by soldiers who await the command to kill him.  Ariskal hears him out, however, but Lemirv (Irna's father) says that Otair's story is a lie, since his daughter would never consort with a foul wizard.<br/><br/>Irna is summoned, and her father and Otair argue who knows and loves her better.  Otair clearly knows Irna and she admits her love for him.  They are betrothed and to wed in a week.<br/><br/>Shamed, Lemirv goes silent.<br/><br/><br/>(continued below)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140440/#Comment_140440" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T21:50:04+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  9:50PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, I want to hear more about the Best Interests sheet.

To lure Mekado out in the open, they could offer further negotiations and Irna could play the role of a peace offering.<br/><br/>Ariskal rejects this plan out of hand, as it would deeply undermine his fortifications and endanger the people of Rennek.  They continue to argue, and Irna suggests a change to the plan - that she and Otair go in the form of eagles to Mekado's tent.  There, Otair could remove his magic from her, and she could distract the warlord as Otair transforms him into a rabbit.  Ariskal is interested in this offer.<br/><br/>To secure their escape, should things go ill, Otair proposes that Ariskal launch a counterattack.<br/><br/>Ariskal accepts the deal, and as the two eagles fly off, he tells his men to hold fast to the walls.  No counterattack will be made.<br/><br/>The eagles fly over Mekado's camp; this is a good omen and the warlord appears from his tent to gaze at the sky.  The eagles dive, and fly into the tent, where they see Otaro bound and bloodied next to the fire.  Otaro tries to warn Mekado that this is an ill omen, and is rewarded with a machete cleaving his head in two.  <br/><br/>Irna transforms into her own form, and tells Mekado that they are spirit-gifts, to tell him his victory will be swift and glorious.  Mekado takes his bloodied machete and puts it before Irna's face, then says "Drink!"<br/><br/>Irna licks the blood of her lover's father from the blade, and as she does so Otair (still in the form of an eagle) perches on Mekado's shoulder.  Then the transformation begins.  Mekado tries to struggle, but his cries are quiet as he can hardly move.  In seconds, the transformation is over.<br/><br/>Two eagles fly from the tent, tearing at the carcass of a rabbit that was once a fearsome general.<br/><br/><i>End of Chapter 2</i><br/><b>For Chapter 3</b> <br/>We're still planning to have Peter there for Chapter 3, so we will continue as planned for Gulden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140488/#Comment_140488" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-19T12:23:33+00:00" title="April 19, 2008 12:23PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two PC's don't seem to have really strongly conflicting best interests, was that intentional/accidental?<br/><br/>Ima as NPC seems set up to bring them into conflict but doesn't really.<br/><br/>I ask because part of what I've found is that when PC's conflict in best interests then even when there is a conflict in which a particular PC is not directly involved, they are more interested in the conflict and attend to it (and overall session feels more fun).
