Exactly that, thanks a lot Rickard!. Hmmm, from what I'm seeing, the stronger the opposition (3d6), the chances of winning with a high level skill (3d6) are worse than 1d6 vs 1d6, and if I rule for it to be &gt;= then things go a lot easier to the players. Hmm, I think I can use this as a favorable/unfavorable situation modifier to the roll, like when rolling attack at night against a distant target under the rain, ties don't count, for example.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413429/#Comment_413429" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T14:27:17+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  2:27PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2013 2:32PM by timonkey.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What are the odds of rolling 2d6 of different colors and having one dice result beat the other's? What if it's the best of 2 or three dice against a single opposing d6? And against the best 2 or 3? Are the odds affected when the same amount of dice are added to both sides?</blockquote>\nOdds of one die beating another?  It's 50/50, but you only win if you don't tie.  The odds of tying are 1/6 (you roll whatever the other guy did) and the odds of not tying are 1 minus that.  So the odds are 0.5*(1- 1/6) = 0.5*5/6 = 5/12 ~= 41.7%<br/><br/>What about best of 2d6 vs. 1d6?  Let's pretend you roll 2d6 one at a time.  Then, the second 2d6 only helps if you didn't win with the first.  So your odds of winning are 5/12 + (1-5/12)*P(winning with 2nd die given that you didn't with the first).  Unfortunately, our P() here isn't 5/12 because knowing that our first die didn't win tells us something about what the other die is (it's more likely to be higher, in fact, it's the best of 2d6!).  Hmm, that's some symmetry.  Let's call this P1 = probability of beating the best of 2d6 with 1d6.  Let P2 = probabilty of winning with best of 2d6 vs 1d6 (what we're looking for).  So <br/>P1 + P2 + P(tie) = 1 <br/>and, from above:<br/>P2 = 5/12 + (1 - 5/12)*P1 = 5/12 + (1 - 5/12)*(1 - P2 - P(tie))<br/>so what's P(tie)?, which remember is tie in best of 2d6 vs 1d6.  P(tie) = 1/6, because whatever the result of best of 2d6, there's a 1/6 chance of rolling that on the other die.  So<br/>P2 = 5/12 + (1 - 5/12)*(5/6 - P2)<br/>some algebra yields:<br/>P2 + 7/12*P2 = 19/12*P2 = 5/12 + 7/12*5/6<br/>P2 = 12/19*(5/12 + 7/12*5/6) = (5 + 35/6)/19 = 65/6/19 ~= 57% (doesn't quite match anydice, did I make an arithmetic error somewhere?)<br/><br/>You can extend this to 3d6.<br/><br/>The odds are affected when you roll the same number of dice on each side.  Since you are taking the best of multiple rolls, the probability of rolling high increases.  Since it's more likely to roll high for both of you, you're more likely to tie.  You still have a 50/50 chance when you don't tie.  Maybe I'll get to calculating this later.  <br/>Edit: Some thoughts on a method.  Extend the method above to get best of 3d6 vs 1d6, then use this to calculate 2d6 vs 2d6 (as the odds of the 2nd opponent die helping are odds that its better than all 3 other dice (same as 3d6 vs 1d6).  Seeing this progression, I would want to go back and preserve more meaning in the equations so I could use iteration (I think proof by induction is the term I'm looking for?) to extend this to Nd6 vs Md6.  Although really once you start rolling 6 dice or so you're gonna be rolling a lot of 6s and getting a lot of ties too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413435/#Comment_413435" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T15:22:26+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  3:22PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, no prob, I was thinking of leaving it up to 3 dice as a top case.
