The rules are written as though it is a face to face game but if works great by email. <br/><br/><br/><br/>EMG 10-18-10<br/><br/>The Engle Matrix Game is a simple low tech game engine for running a wide variety of games. Whatever your purpose there is a Matrix game that can do it. The following rules are the basic game.<br/><br/>Matrix games are about people and stories. They allow two to eight players to play a   game in thirty minutes or up to two hours. One player takes on the special role of game host (here after known as the host). The host's job is to make the players feel welcome and to keep the game moving. They do this by walking the players through an action script and setting what players have to roll for their scenes to happen. The other players each run one character in the story. They tell the story by making up scenes.<br/><br/>The host starts the game by reading the story opener to the players. This is a short piece that explains the situation and what is going on. The host then lays out the map and the possible characters. The players each pick a character and read the description out loud. This information helps the players form a mental picture of the game world. The game is about changing this mental map. This is the matrix of Matrix games.<br/><br/>Each player gets a character counter to show their location on the map, two six-sided dice - to help determine which scenes happen and which don't - a character sheet - that has the beginning character description - and ten or fifteen action tokens - Which are used to buy the right to make counter-arguments (more on this later). Players get ten action tokens if there are five or more players otherwise they get fifteen.<br/><br/>The players place their characters on the map. This sets up who is with whom. The host places all un-played characters. Players are allowed to move their character one area before each scene. <br/><br/>The host picks a player to make the first scene. <br/><br/>The host prompts the first player to make their scene by asking them "What happens next?" The player then describes what their character does and what happens because of this. They may also say what other characters do but for the first turn they should keep it personal. Whatever the player says is their \u201cscene\u201d. This may be very short, such as "I knock on the door and they let me in." or long and complicated (a page of written text for instance).<br/><br/>The host/referee decides what number the player has to roll equal to or under on two six-sided dice for the scene to happen. All scenes are automatically set at seven but the host may move the number up or down is they wish. New hosts should keep the number at seven or better until they feel comfortable with their judgment. If they like a scene they may raise the number (but not above eleven), if they don\u2019t like it they may lower it. The host prompts the player to make their roll by saying "Roll!"<br/><br/>The following table should help the referee decide what number to set rolls at.<br/><br/>Can't miss\t\t11<br/>Really likely\t\t10<br/>Pretty likely\t\t9<br/>Probably\t\t8<br/>Okay\t\t\t7<br/>Maybe\t\t6<br/>Pretty unlikely\t5<br/>Really unlikely\t4<br/>No way!\t\t3<br/>Impossible\t\t2<br/><br/>The player rolls for their own action. If they miss their roll the referee asks the next player to the right "What happens next?" If they roll equal to or lower than the number the host said then their action happens. The host should jot down a short summary of the scene.<br/><br/>The host then asks "Does anyone what to make a counter-argument?" Any player who wants to may pay an action token and make up an alternate version of the scene. The host sets a roll for each counter-argument and the player rolls. As many players as want may make counter-arguments. The ones that pass the first roll have a chance to happen. The host wraps up the turn by asking "Does anyone else want to make a counter-argument?" If no one does then the host says "I want everyone who made a successful scene to roll two six-sided dice. The high roller wins." (Note: The player who made the opening scene also rolls). The host then jots down a summary of the scene that won. Once the second roll is done the host asks the next player to the right "What happens next?" <br/><br/>While the player is thinking about their scene the other players may move their character one area, talk to one another, form teams, make plans or do short ad lib role plays between their characters. This is the natural moment to take a break in play. Making scenes, moving characters, and performing role plays are how things happen in the game. <br/><br/>The game goes on until the players decide they have finished the story or only one player has unspent action tokens. Depending on the game the players are rewarded for doing certain things. This determines who the winner is but for the most part the game is about telling a good story. If that is done then everyone wins.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417091/#Comment_417091" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T05:29:38+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  5:29AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll second Ghost/Echo since I've ran that PbP as well as Lacuna which I've ran once via six hour marathon chat and twice via PbP.

You pre-roll all of your dice ahead of time, and then spend them to take actions. Initiative goes from "long sets" to "short sets" (a "set" being matching dice), but if someone doesn't go in the proper turn order, you can just say "skip to the next player if the turn isn't taken by Time X".<br/><br/>A nice thing about the game is that the defender doesn't need to resolve anything. The attacker spends a set of dice and flat-out damages the defender. They know exactly what effect they have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417101/#Comment_417101" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T06:30:27+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  6:30AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Primetime Adventures works well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morgan_R" title="Morgan_R"><img alt="Morgan_R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morgan_R">Morgan_R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417107/#Comment_417107" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T07:06:54+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  7:06AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the suggestions, folks! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417126/#Comment_417126" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T09:52:31+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  9:52AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do not miss Vincent Baker's Sundered Land games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417165/#Comment_417165" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T16:28:32+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  4:28PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The EMG games do run light and fun.
