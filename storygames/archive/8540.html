The working title is <i>Neverwood</i>.  The Setting is called Neverwood Territory, and it's approximately the same size as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_purchase" rel="nofollow">Lousiana Purchase</a>.  The vibe is basically (American Frontier) + (Weird Fantasy) + (Old Testament).  To give you a post t'hitch to, just think Stephen King's <i>The Dark Tower I: the Gunslinger</i> and you'll be pretty much on-target.<br/><br/>So, I've got standards about Setting.  I figure that if the PCs can't interact with it, it doesn't actually matter, and therefore doesn't enter play, and therefore isn't Setting (the capital S indicating that I am talking about one of the five components of Exploration, which exists only in play) -- meaning that it was a waste of time for you to read it, and a waste of time for me to write it.  That's how I feel.<br/><br/>So here's what I'm doing:  I'm taking individual details of the setting and trying to figure out the implications of them:  what they mean to people's lives, what structures they create in communities, and how they can be used to create Situation (or, better yet, create Situation by themselves just by being around).  And I'd like to enlist your help in this.<br/><br/>Here's how this'll go:  I'll post some details, with implications that I've thought of for them so far, and we'll discuss.  At some point we'll move on to another set of details.  Sound like fun?  It does to me!<br/><br/><b>#1:  PAPER IS RARE IN MOST PARTS</b><br/>Although the heart of Neverwood Territory is a huge forest called the Neverwood, most of the Territory is desert, and paper is therefore rare, as all the available lumber is used for construction and firewood, rather than being pulped to make paper:<br/><br/><i>IMPLICATIONS</i><br/><br/>1.) Paper is valuable in most parts.<br/>1a.) People re-use paper as much as possible.<br/>1b.) Things like written invitations are extravagances.<br/><br/>2.) Parchment is also used, but unfortunately also expensive, as the demand for leather and other products made from animal hide means that not much parchment gets made.<br/>2a.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest" rel="nofollow">Palimpsests</a>.<br/><br/>3.) Due to the dearth of books, most folks are illiterate.<br/><br/>4.) News gets around by word of mouth, and thus travels slowly between communities.<br/>4a.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_crier" rel="nofollow">Town criers</a>?<br/><br/><b>#2:  CANAAN USED TO BELONG TO GIANTS</b><br/>The one highly fertile region in the Territory is a river delta called Canaan.  It once belonged to giants, who were mostly exterminated, although some were merely driven out.  The giants cultivated land and raised cattle, but they made their homes &amp; cities underground.<br/><br/><i>IMPLICATIONS</i><br/><br/>1.) Disenfranchised giants in the wilderness, angry at the little folk who stole their land.<br/><br/>2.) Giant-size ruins underground, bricked up.<br/>2a.)  Some giants still underground?<br/><br/><b>#3:  ALL GUNS ARE HAND-MADE BY GUNSMITHS</b><br/>Pretty self-explanatory:  no guns are mass-produced; no assembly lines or anything.<br/><br/><i>IMPLICATIONS</i><br/><br/>1.) The quality of guns varies widely depending on the skill of who made it.<br/><br/>2.)  All guns are unique.<br/>2a.)  Calibers often don't match up with guns from other regions where, for whatever reason, other dimensions were used and became traditional.<br/><br/>3.)  Talented gunsmiths are sought-after and probably well-to-do.<br/>3a.)  Their techniques are carefully guarded secrets, in order to maintain their status<br/><br/><b>Discuss.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189237/#Comment_189237" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T16:30:57+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  4:30PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> - No paper but surrounded by sand?  <br/><br/>What about etched or painted glass for important documents?

Once the infrastructure is in place, you  can pump 'em out, even without an industrial line-based production.  Now, if you are a traveler, you will likely want to mint your own, unless gunsmiths  hang a shingle that states they also sell "foreign slugs" as well (kind of like standard vs metric tools in working on cars).<br/><br/>Gunsmiths of a particular skill might even create a kit of barrels and such for a masterpiece weapon to allow it use variant ammo, but this is basically building a series of guns that use the same framework.<br/><br/>Shotguns would simply need insert rings to allow them to load varied shells to be of wider use.  Smiths might also have a considerable list of loads for shotguns that are unique to their houses - flechettes, bean-bags, rock-salt, various weights of shot, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189246/#Comment_189246" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T17:01:26+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  5:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            God, I'm geeking out already.

Charcoal was the usual early fuel that could get hot enough for this purpose...charcoal wastes a TON of wood...which means if wood is rare for fire, its also rare for charcoal which means metal working will probably be limited.  Limited metalworking means not enough widespread trial and error practice, which means it probably hasn't advanced far enough for sophisticated metal technology like mechanics or firearms.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefor, you probably need to postulate an alternative energy source like coal to make you desired level of metal working practical (it didn't alwasy have to be a desert).  Alternatively you could have all of the more advanced metal working artifacts be passed down from a pre-desert time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to glass consider clay tablets and slate (i.e. chalk boards) as writing utensils.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an arid setting I've been working on.  For money in that setting (where precious metal was rare) I used gemstones.  Since the value of a gem requires some expertise to appraise, professional appraisers would appraise the value of gems in "marks" (the original tally mark meaning of value from which the Mark as currency evolved) and seal the gems inside a clay ball marked with the value and their personal seal and then sealed in a glass glaze.  These clay balls would then be passed around as currency because people had faith that the value of the gems within was authentic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189269/#Comment_189269" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T19:21:02+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  7:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>4.)

Paper is rare enough that nobody would use it to print something that would be blowing down the street the next day.  And newspapers would be the only fast way to spread news, given that there ain't gonna be much travelers heading out to Gehenna out in the desert, so the best way to get news from Gilead would be a load of newspapers from the train (from which it's doubtful that anyone will be disembarking, less'n it's the Federal Marshals, and they're always bad news), but Gilead needs wood just as bad as you do, so they don't have any newspapers.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite>Uh, paper can also be made from rags, cotton, wheat, rice, hemp, bamboo, jute and sugarcane.</blockquote>\nDude, I know, but all of that stuff would either be more necessary for other things (like lumber), or unavailable.  I know you can't grow wheat or rice in the desert, and everything aside from hemp seems doubtful.  \n<blockquote><br>I have some doubts about machine guns without standardized cartridges -- early versions jammed often enough as it was. </br></blockquote>\nBut they would be standardized, wouldn't they?

I think that a.) the oil in <i>The Dark Tower IV:  Wizard &amp; Glass</i> was neat, and b.) a <i>There Will Be Blood</i> sort of oil industry would be a great addition to the setting.  Especially given that "there will be blood" is a quotation from Exodus 7:19.  I've got a King James translation, which says "there may be blood," but it means "will be" (and most others say "will be"), but you can't beat the KJ for overall mythic resonance:<br><i>And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.</i>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I don't know about any old westerns...but that scene was used in Patriot with Mel Gibson set during the Revolution.</blockquote>\nHuh.

I was thinking that the Territory itself was under the jurisdiction of Rangers, who are effective and actually care about the Territory because they live there, but are few and spread thin due to the size of the place, and that the Marshals (whose jurisdiction supersedes that of the Rangers) would represent an outside authority that doesn't know shit about what this place is like, and doesn't give a shit for the people in it.  And the Army sits in their forts, spoiling for a fight, and perhaps even raiding nearby towns for provisions.<br/><br/>But then, I guess this high, absent authority could be present in the Territory itself, just sequestered in some tidy hole.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189433/#Comment_189433" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T14:21:59+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  2:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 2:22PM by Valamir.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't know that Peter, thanks for the link:<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a Wikipedia quote on coke that may be applicable to the setting's pseudo time frame.  I didn't realize coke dated back to the 1600s:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The use of coke as a fuel was pioneered by the Chinese in the 11th century during the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279 AD). In Europe, it was innovated during the 17th century in England in response to the ever-growing problem of European deforestation. Wood was becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. Coal's fumes, particularly smoke and sulfur compounds, disqualified it from many applications, including cooking and iron smelting. In 1603, Sir Henry Platt suggested that coal might be charred in a manner analogous to the way charcoal is produced from wood. This process was not put into practice until 1642, when coke was used for roasting malt in Derbyshire. Coal cannot be used in brewing because its sulfurous fumes would impart a foul taste to the beer. In 1709 Abraham Darby established a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron. Coke's superior crushing strength allowed blast furnaces to become taller and larger. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn England in the first years of steam railway locomotives, coke was the normal fuel. This resulted from an early piece of environmental legislation; any proposed locomotive had to "consume its own smoke".This was not technically possible to achieve, but burning coke, with its low smoke emissions, was considered to meet the requirement. This rule was quietly dropped, and cheaper coal became the normal fuel, as railways gained acceptance among the general public.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSmokeless steam trains are kinda cool...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189435/#Comment_189435" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T14:27:26+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  2:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall, some focusing questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) why not the church?<br/>\n2) what does having a central army allow you to do in the setting that having a number of independent armies wouldn't<br/>\n3) what about the chief difference between the Rangers and the Marshalls being secular vs. religious authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189453/#Comment_189453" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T16:20:53+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  4:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>#2:  Giants = Square-Cube Law doesn't exist.

False accusations of witchcraft to further agendas, as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_crucible" rel="nofollow">The Crucible</a>.<br/><br/>2.  Since their magic works, they can do stuff that other folks can't.  This makes them sort of a potential community resource, but one that you don't like to use or think about.  So in some places, witches are tolerated, as long as they stay in their shacks outside of town, until someone's baby is being born breach, or the cattle start dying of the pox.<br/>2a.  When such a witch fails to deal with some problem (even one that's clearly impossible to him, but non-witches don't realize it), this is sure to generate the ire of the populace, who think that he did it on purpose.<br/><br/><i>and...?</i> </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Neverwood] brainstorm with me: implications of setting details - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8540/neverwood-brainstorm-with-me-implications-of-setting-details/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Neverwood] brainstorm with me: implications of setting details - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8540/neverwood-brainstorm-with-me-implications-of-setting-details/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: Marshall BurnsYep.

Paper is rare enough that nobody would use it to print something that would be blowing down the street the next day.  And newspapers would be the only fast way to spread news, given that there ain't gonna be much travelers heading out to Gehenna out in the desert, so the best way to get news from Gilead would be a load of newspapers from the train</blockquote>\nYeah sorry, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Nobody gets off the train, sure -- but nobody, like, <i>talks</i> to the people on the train? And then goes into town and tells everyone the news? The point is that the paper is irrelevant to the speed of communication -- this seems so obvious to me that I am having trouble restating it in a new way. All you need is one guy standing by the train whose job/social role/interest is to find out 'the news' and one person on the train with a similar interest and poof -- your communication is <i>just as fast</i> as if the guy on the train passed the other guy the newspaper.<br/><br/>I mean, news is news -- it's important enough that someone is going to care. If there is social or economic advantage in knowing 'the news' then a system will be created to transmit it, and paper or no paper is completely besides the point when it comes to this kind of public information. I mean, like, town criers? Paper doesn't move any faster than whatever is moving it -- unless you have some technology that moves paper faster than it moves people, there is no appreciable difference in the speed at which most information travels when you do or do not have paper. The only limitations are the speed at which people move and how much they can remember -- which is quite a lot. Paper helps for disseminating long treatises, or the like, and once you have mail delivery then paper makes private communication much less expensive than paying an oral messenger... but paper or no paper your communities are as isolated as the travel of humans between them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189654/#Comment_189654" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T18:02:50+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  6:02PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>What that's really about is that I want some government that is ostensibly in charge of the Territory, but actually pretty much absent, except for occasional things that are of great interest (e.g. conquering Canaan) to the government, in which case it will bring in the Army (stationed in several forts in the Territory) or Federal Marshals.</blockquote>\nMy feeling is that you should take the dial on the 'separation' between Back East and the territories and turn it up to 12. Like -- not only do these trains never stop, but nobody knows who is on them, who is running them, where they come from, or where they go. Or they go to Gilead where they are provided 'offerings' that involve zero human interaction, and are protected by some kind of intensely superstitious/religious feeling. From the point of view of the game there is no Back East, there are simply these anachronistic/culturally alien artifacts that move through the landscape for reasons nobody understands.<br/><br/>Perhaps they occasionally discharge alien figures in alien clothes who speak alien languages and 'fix' things in violent and disruptive ways, using machines of immense power.<br/><br/>If you ratchet it all up to Plague/Quarantine levels then you don't have to worry about all the holes in your technological/political situation that a nearby, culturally-related, economically-interested, technologically-superior civilization seems to be introducing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189681/#Comment_189681" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T22:11:12+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 10:11PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I mean, news is news -- it's important enough that someone is going to care.

If you have ICE's gossip-monger pulling news off the train and then word-of-mouthing it across the whole town, everyone will hear the news, sure, but they'll be hearing slightly distorted versions of the news, and the more people the news passes through, the more distorted the news will be.  Surely newspapers have biases and distort the news they cover, but the "distortion curve" is way, <em>way</em> sharper via word of mouth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>
