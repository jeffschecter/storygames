These tend to be the posts of most interest to me actually So I'm in no wise complaining. <br/><br/>With the large numbers of games submitted to the various game competitions, it's not hard to get the impression that game making is nearly as big in "the hobby" as game playing. <br/><br/>so I'm wondering where else (online) people engage in story game design talk or listen to analysis of storygame systems etc. <br/><br/>I can recommend a few sites myself actually:  a google+ community called "games on trial" that seems to involve some posters here actually. Also the podcast "across the table" has some great analysis.  <br/><br/>So where else do you go to engage in storygame design discussions. <br/><br/>Thanks!

SG was at first not a design forum.<br/>2. SG started becoming a design forum. <br/>3. SG became too much of a design forum, and the designers were banished to the Praxis forum. <br/><br/>This was a long time ago, and in my mind SG has never recovered from the split. <br/><br/>My suggestion would first be to acquire a time travel device and return to the glory days of SG before the split. <br/><br/>My second suggestion, should a TTD not be available, find a small group. And discuss your thoughts with them.  Be it under the cover of a podcast recording or a pizza night, or even late night ramblings on Facebook messenger. That is where you will strike gold. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466106/#Comment_466106" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-06T09:56:12+00:00" title="September  6, 2017  9:56AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Participating in a Game Chef or similarly structured contest is good.

The equivalent Finnish channel has practically designed a couple of excellent rpgs right there over the last few years; <i>Tales of Entropy</i>, for instance, was largely developed over IRC.<br/><br/>Not that I wouldn't prefer the forum-based approach, just like everybody else, but there is things to be said in favour of a small, committed team that hangs out online, ready to address design conundrums in real time. It's sort of like a book club for game design; works well if you happen to get the right people into the team.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466125/#Comment_466125" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-06T23:14:18+00:00" title="September  6, 2017 11:14PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff slater:  our story game seattle play testing group who meets in real life has been a great thing to be involved with, but that has ended, at least for the time being.

Did you know that even if the other person hasn't much experience with game design, just by trying to explain them your game you can make instant progress and notice flaws in the design? Things that often may sound great in your head become clear crystal when you put them in words. Funny enough, writing them down doesn't have the same effect as trying to explain them to others.<br/><br/>However it is kinda sad there aren't too many places like SG anymore, or at least I expected to see more listed. Let's hope technology eventually finds a better way to help us exchange ideas, organize them, archive them for later use and find other people interested.                        </div>\n<div

Most of the bigger threads go off topic frequently, so the TG Chat Thread, the TG Industry thread and so on will end up talking about tabletop game design, but that's not their focus (and mostly from the perspective of evaluating existing games, rather than making your own). <br/><br/>EDIT: But I should clarify that Something Awful is a place I discuss story game design because I'm also interested in everything else they discuss there, and there's a lot of overlap between their game philosophy and mine; I wouldn't go there specifically to talk game design if I wasn't interested in the rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466295/#Comment_466295" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-17T07:55:14+00:00" title="September 17, 2017  7:55AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" rel="nofollow">Sanglorian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>EDIT: But I should clarify that Something Awful is a place I discuss story game design because I'm also interested in everything else they discuss there, and there's a lot of overlap between their game philosophy and mine; I wouldn't go there specifically to talk game design if I wasn't interested in the rest.</p></div></blockquote>\nAnd... are you able to provide a quick pitch what "the rest" is all about?

While I appreciate a solid theoretical background, my passion is in designing games. So, I'm too impatient to follow &amp; contribute to very lenghty discussions. I prefer to get and give game design advice in brevity. Probably to the theorists, my posts may seem shallow, I don't know. <br/><br/>Still, just saying "go to G+" is also not the answer. I really appreciate the forum format with the ability to reference and return to discussions. I also don't want to join a traditional RPG or board game design forum, they tend to have a different focus,<br/>"Story Games Forum" is really the right place because here is where the people are who like the same games I like.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, is the Reforged community still active?

Instead of having forums for different games or topics (design, the industry, crowdfunding), there's just a thread per game or per topic. <br/><br/>Even where there are multiple threads for the one game, the split might be about attitudes to the game. For example, there are multiple threads on Warhammer/Warhammer 40k, with one thread for Warhammer fans, one for Warhammer detractors, and so on.<br/><br/>Typically each thread's first post is an introduction to whatever game/topic the thread is about, and then everything that follows is just unstructured discussion. <br/><br/>So for example, the Reaper thread discussed the new Bones Kickstarter, the Reaper employee with alt-right sympathies, how you can give Bones miniatures to your kids to play with because they're unbreakable, etc., all roughly at the same time and in the same place.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466421/#Comment_466421" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T13:43:44+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  1:43PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I see no need to separate theoretical discussions from more practical ones (and even like having them all in the same place!).<br/><br/>I'm happy to participate in both, as (I think) I have always done.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466424/#Comment_466424" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T13:54:43+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  1:54PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could imagine having threads with [theory] and [praxis] tags - maybe even for the same topic.<br/>This way, one thread could focus on concise answers while the other could pursue in-length discussions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466428/#Comment_466428" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T14:06:50+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  2:06PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think it's totally fine for anyone starting a thread to specify what kind of feedback they want. <br/><br/>(Personally, I don't think tags are necessary for this - I don't really know how I would meangibfully engage differently with the same query given different tags like that.

There have been a few efforts in this vein so far, but not anything that really carves out this one particular niche of the rpgverse. This kinda thing exists for pbta games and I think it has expanded the community of players.  One of the obvious counters to this suggestion is that the audience would be too small.  But that's true of any movement in its formative years. Build it and they will come. <br/><br/>The gauntlet has expanded pbta gaming. Across the table and indices have addressed story games more than other places I'm aware of. I'd love for there to be a podcast ALL about gmLess storygames though. <br/><br/>I'm too inexperienced to do this well. Someone should seize the opportunity. The niche is there for you to claim!  <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Davey                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
