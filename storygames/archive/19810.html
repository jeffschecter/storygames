This would likely be a multi-Doctor story so being able to differentiate between them is a must. Considering they're all basically a super-genius scientist / tinkerer type all the Doctors would then have Clever at +3 and a bevy of stunts related to that. I want to avoid the kind of samey feel you typically get with FAE rather than have it compounded by the fact I'll be having any number of characters who are essentially different iterations of the same person.<br/><br/>Now, I really like that FAE's default approaches are also basically personality traits, and that's something I'd like to keep. I'm a big fan of Cubicle 7's initiative system in their Doctor Who game, but all the fiddly bits of character creation and point-buy systems, especially with a multi-Doctor story, just leave me cold. I'd thought about just scaling the approaches down to the list of C7's initiative order (talker, mover, doer, fighter), but again, almost all the Doctors would have Talker +3 with minor variation at best from there.<br/><br/>The simplest solution would be to simple remove or replace Clever with something else. But what? Any variant that indicates smarts would face the same issue.<br/><br/>So, I'm asking the forum. What FAE approaches do you think would work best to emulate Doctor Who whilst also allowing a reasonable amount of variation between the Doctors? Any help or pointers are appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ThoughtCheck" title="ThoughtCheck"><img alt="ThoughtCheck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ThoughtCheck">ThoughtCheck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439520/#Comment_439520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T00:43:31+00:00" title="October 17, 2014 12:43AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the simple solution of replacing Clever will work, as long as there are multiple replacements for different kinds of smarts; being clever is so fundamental to any Doctor Who setting that I think it justifies having multiple approaches.<br/><br/>I can see two big elements to Clever which would be important to the Doctor: there's doing science and spouting history and generally being the smartest guy in the room, but then there's being clever with people (and person-like entities) specifically, which you might call something like Personable. Reading people, predicting their actions, telling them what they want to hear, things of that nature. Ten has Great (+3) Personable, and gets a cult of personality wherever he goes, while Nine is stuck with a Mediocre (+0) Personable.<br/><br/>This won't fix the problem of everyone having high Clever, but it at gives another reasonable option for an apex approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439535/#Comment_439535" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-17T11:35:40+00:00" title="October 17, 2014 11:35AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about Chatty? I'm admittedly not as well-versed on Classic Who, but it strikes me that chattiness is an attribute only really displayed in spades by some Doctors. Others tend to be more Forceful in their approach. Or, perhaps Flighty would be a good one, or Confusing. Actually, Confusing might be the best one--when The Doctor does completely incomprehensible things at a rapid pace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
