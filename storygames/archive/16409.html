Thanks for the view - My name is Jason Stoffa and i am the co-owner of Fat Goblin Games and game designer at Creaturedaily.com. I indulge you to check out our newly launched Kickstarter project! Heres a little bit of info about the project:   Unlike traditional fantasy settings, Steampunk Musha draws on East Asian mythology and history and combines aspects of several cultural traditions along with Victorian-era technology. The traditional Oriental setting is thrown into a roaring industrial age, where incredible new inventions contrast with ancient mysteries and restless spirits. High fantasy and science fiction clash and combine in the middle of the conflict between old and new, father and son, mechanical and spiritual.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374915/#Comment_374915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T08:40:53+00:00" title="April 29, 2012  8:40AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure a liberal dose of google would provide the link for me, but you might want to include it for those who could potentially invest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374925/#Comment_374925" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T10:35:42+00:00" title="April 29, 2012 10:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>What does "Musha" mean, and do you actually intend to use the word "Oriental" in your game/promotional materials?

Unless you're from the UK or Australia, where apparently the terms don't have that same connotation (UK: Accepted; Aus: Archaic, not-used).<br/><br/>Aaanyway, not likely to make any headway, but there's the basics. It's not up to your Asian-American* reader to get pissed off at your use of Oriental, pick up the phone and call Every Business That Ever Used the Term until they finally get down the list to you, and it's kinda crappy to imply that's the method for getting through to you. Just saying.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* (then again, as mentioned, if you were born/raised in the UK or Australia, then it could just be that you didn't know it was such a big issue in the US, and it would be that good ol American hammer of mono-culturalism to insist that you should have known about it.

The title is one issue, obviously (along with the repeated use of the term in multiple places in the description), but I would also ask: is there a structure to the "Asian" language sprinkled through the description? Is it based on some existing language, or built around a reasonable linguistic theory that happens to sound stereotypically Asian? (This seems a little unlikely since there are words from different Asian languages used as part of it.) Similarly, is there some core organizing principle behind the melange of Asian cultures in the book, or is it mostly just what people thought was interesting from a wide range of Asian civilizations, mixed into one unwieldy pot? Are there any people of Asian descent working on the game? Do you have any concerns that the storyline of a backwards Asian country encountering a much more advanced "traditional" civilization reinforces some colonialist narratives? What does the relationship between the "foreigners" and the "Rosuto-Shimians" look like -- what do the foreigners want? What motivates the Rosuto-Shimians to abandon their "old gods"? Honestly, I'd really like to see a game like this, but...I'm worried.<br/><br/>edit: crossposted <blockquote><cite>Posted By: JasonStoffa</cite>While i respect the individual's right to hold whatever views and opinions a person desires , its not my place to judge.</blockquote>\nWhy not?

Just like nearly every fictional depiction of Native Americans blends several of the original cultures together (though, to be fair, some of that cultural blending actually happened, as a result of being relocated onto shared reservations).

Which is a heck of a lot like the China of Mulan - it's big like China and it's not an island, but it's culture is much more based on Japan).<br/><br/>So in the process of working on that game, John Wick leaned a heck of a lot about Japanese culture, which he did his best to put into a game form and present it in a way that gamers would get, without needing to spend like 5 years doing research. And yeah, he tweaked some stuff and simplified some stuff, like you do when you're trying to boil down something that would take 10,000 pages to detail well down into maybe 50 pages.<br/><br/>And in the course of playing that game, many people got exposed to aspects of a culture that they would otherwise know little about. Many of those players were inspired to read a lot more of the source materials and learn more about actual Japanese and other Asian cultures.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm sure many of them just relied on stereotypes and didn't learn anything useful. And some of them probably played in a very disrespectful "ching-chong" style, though I suspect that didn't happen very often - the game didn't lend itself easily to that.<br/><br/>I don't know, but it seems to me that inspiring people to become interested in a culture they are not familiar with has a lot of potential to do more good than harm.<br/><br/>It's been my experience that roleplaying gamers tend to be some of the most broadly knowledgeable and sensitive folks I know. Sure, some of that knowledge is shallow. And some of it is wrong (I need to get my Chinese culinary history facts straight, obviously).<br/><br/>But to be honest, if I stood up right now in my cubicle at work, I could point out maybe 2 people out of 20 who'd be likely to be interested in learning more about Asian cultures. The girl looks Vietnamese by my best guess. And the guy, I'd say, looks Korean, but I could be off. And I could totally be wrong about them - they may have no interest at all in Asian cultural studies.

I was skeptical seeing what looked to be a mashup of samurai, ninja, mecha and steampunk stuff: but flipping through it, they did the setting up as a fantasy Sengoku period with just fantasy countries of Japan instead of real ones. The design of the countries and their specialty qualities was both awesome (gonzo) and rooted in something real.<br/><br/>John Wick's Blood and Honor is also a look at a fantastical Japan analogue as well. It's not for everyone, but it's kind of the closest game out there to a fantasy Japan (in terms of requiring all characters to be immersed in culture through the rules) that I've seen, next to Sengoku, which is a fantastical look at real Japan (and thus kind of hard to think of adventures for).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375311/#Comment_375311" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T16:33:41+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  4:33PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>That's hard, because he's an excellent storyteller.

As to the impact of his work, it's huge, academically. Check out the Influence section on the Wikipedia page. His follow up article from 1985, Orientalism Reconsidered, has over 20 000 citations on Google Scholar.<br/><br/>I am very curious as to what a "<i>a constellation of false assumptions underlying Western attitudes toward the Middle East</i>" has to do with a fantasy setting with East Asian influences, nor do I see a clear link here with the term "oriental" as applied to people living in the United States whose ancestors at some point lived in Korea/Japan/China(in fact, the article cited above refers to people living in the Orient as orientals without any caveats). While Google Scholar metrics are wonderful, I wish people would actually read the wikipedia articles they cite, and the freely available 20-odd page articles they try to impress me with. In fact, this discussion would probably have been a bit more insightful if someone had given some thought to the closing paragraphs of the article in question.<br/><br/>For Steampunk MUSHA to be an "orientalist" work in the Said sense, it needs to be part of a discourse which serves to create a justification for European and American colonial/imperial ambitions. Does it do so? The devil is in the details. It seems to draw on the Sengoku jidae, which offers a potentially interesting perspective on the relationship between two civilisations, which if modelled on actual historical dynamics is much more interesting than the traditional colonialist model. The setting itself is only problematic if (intentionally or not) it may form part of the toolbox for justifying oppression of particular ethnic groups within the culture it is consumed, or imperialist policies towards external cultures.  <br/><br/>If the term "Victoriental" is actually offensive to people living in the United States, that is unfortunate for the book and its publishers, and they should probably do something about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375322/#Comment_375322" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T16:47:32+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  4:47PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>John Wick's Blood and Honor is also a look at a fantastical Japan analogue as well.

Allow me to illustrate which one with an example.<br/><br/>The 4th Indiana jones movie, the kingdom of the crystal skull, was set in Peru. I was born and I live in Peru. I went to art college here, studied pre-hispanic cultures, I have traveled through my country and seen most of the supposed locations used on the movie. I've seen old pictures of some of those places on the time that the movie is supposed to be set. So you can believe me when I say that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg took too many creative liberties, confused peruvians with mexicans (and thus kept faithful to the myth that every place and person in south america looks and feels mexican), and totally misrepresented my country and culture. Yet there wasn't a single peruvian I talked with that felt the movie was racist.<br/><br/>What we all peruvians thought and agreed was that the movie was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stupid</span>. And so are the creators, for not even using Google to document their fiction.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really appreciate the concern about any form of denigration of other cultures and beliefs this community has; but apart from pointing how badly used are the references in any kind of fictional content or how inappropiate is a caricaturization or archetype used in fiction, taking it to the point of calling everything racism is really too much. It doesn't help. <br/>If you're actually concerned, point the author to the proper references and documentation, help them get their promotion right, because as poorly and misrepresented as they are doing it, they are showing other people's culture to a wider audience.<br/><br/>I dunno how many tourists we had here in Peru because of that crappy movie, but I'm sure now those guys got it right and found out there was much more than that here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375476/#Comment_375476" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T10:19:07+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 10:19AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>If you're actually concerned, point the author to the proper references and documentation, help them get their promotion right, because as poorly and misrepresented as they are doing it, they are showing other people's culture to a wider audience.</blockquote>\nWell, that's why I asked those questions -- to try to understand where they were coming from.

If you're a lit major then you should know for damn sure that stories, while great and wonderful and an expression into the author's mindset and culture, if that author is a white dude then you're going to get the reinforcement of cultural norms, which tend to be kyriarchical in nature.

I apologize if that came off in the wrong way. <br/><br/>History is a complex discipline, but -- at least in a modern context -- in has to do with a lot more than just collecting stories uncritically. Newspaper reporters can't even get away with doing that. They have to back up their findings with actual facts (often corraborated from multiple sources, not just one), so that when people challenge the accuracy of what they wrote, they have some ground to stand on. And historians are generally held (or, at least, should be held) to higher levels of accountability than reporters, who work under much tighter deadlines and have fewer traditions about properly citing their sources. As a historian, you live and die by your ability to convince other people of the usefulness (and hopefully the factual accuracy) of your interpretation of events. Telling an interesting story is often beside the point, because it can actually hurt your ability to descern the truth --- actual historical events are typically not as cut-and-dry as stories, and following a pleasant-sounding narrative can lead you to assert things that may not, in fact, be true. The entire field of history is mostly concerned with arguing over different interpretations of the same events or finding new interpretations or facts about things that change existing views of the broader picture. And that means you have to be able to back up any claims you make, especially if they challenge Status Quo understandings (and if they don't, why bother?).<br/><br/>Collecting stories from people, in both news reporting and history, is generall considered "hearsay" unless it's backed up by other more trustworthy sources. Some historians and anthropologists examine not what actually happened (historical fact) but what people believe happened (historical memory), in which case, sure, gathering that kind of evidence is super helpful. And doing things like conducting interviews can lead you to interpretations and sources that you wouldn't have found otherwise, so it's an important research technique. But you have to do much more work than that if you're going to assert something you heard as being the actual truth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375673/#Comment_375673" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T17:54:34+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  5:54PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite>I think he quickly determined that we aren't his target audience.</blockquote>\nActually, I was more than willing to throw money at that kickstarter.

Walton, thank you for your thoughtful response. And for acknowledging the partial role that collecting stories can play. I think, in context, it should be seen as a useful, if extremely imperfect, historical record because Asbury was concerned with presenting a part of history that was underrecorded - he focused on crime and gangs and prostitutes and such. Of course, in doing so, he presented stories that were surely sensationalized.<br/><br/>I'd just hoped that the chop suey story was true. I'd never thought to fact check it and had repeated it to others. I'm grateful for having had my mistake pointed out.<br/><br/>(And no, Jonathan L, I didn't take Asbury's stories at face value as perfect, unvarnished truth. I read them as stories about real people. Stories, even real stories about and by real people, are never abstract perfect facts. They are constructions. That's the attitude they "let me graduate with". And I didn't ask you - your condesension in "spoon feeding" me was unwarranted and unwanted and immensely pretentious.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375748/#Comment_375748" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T20:03:57+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:03PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 8:11PM by Jonathan.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And now I take a deep breath, edit what was here and apologize for it as well as stop because clearly I'm not in the best frame of mind for it.<br/><br/>It shouldn't have been so sarcastic and condescending because it didn't help anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375798/#Comment_375798" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T01:15:32+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  1:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha, you guys talking about historians!

And that, historically, history was done with less good technique. I've read some old history texts which obviously involved a lot of just making shit up. But I've read them with a lit major's way of looking at things.\n<blockquote> Some people are starting to get into oral history, but it's still pretty stigmatized in many places.

Basically, they're giving the students the opportunity to construct some of their understanding of history themselves.<br/><br/>Of course, how you select documents for them to look at still gives the textbook creators tons of opportunity to frame the discourse. But I think it's an improvement. But maybe that's partly because I'm a lit guy, so I really enjoy reading interesting period documents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376010/#Comment_376010" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T16:35:37+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  4:35PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>But I've read them with a lit major's way of looking at things.</blockquote>\nCool.

If you have a bunch of old letters and stuff that are fragile and aren't easily available, instead of just reading them at the archive and writing your analysis, you could scan them all and publish a book of them, with your own notes and annotations included. It would still be less expensive than a ton of university press books, which end up being a hundred bucks each or so and only libraries ever buy them.

To begin with, what negative stereotypes are you even talking about?<br/>This is going to take a bit to unpack. I'll try not to ramble too much.<br/><br/>Let me start with a story. Well, more of a character sketch, really, but whatever. I've been taking the Blue Line train in Los Angeles back and forth to work every day for the past 3 months. This train goes through Compton, Lynwood, Watts, and some other neighborhoods that people call "urban". A few weeks ago, a couple of teenagers, black, got on the bus and sat in the seats that faced each other in front of me and one of the asked me very politely to excuse him as he reached down next to my legs to plug his phone in. I told him I hadn't known there were electrical plugs on the train and he pointed out where they were. I wasn't using headphones that day, so I ended up listening to him talk on the phone about his interest in joining the military - he looked like either a junior or senior in high school. And I heard him say some very articulate and respectful things about a girl he was interested in. I think the 2 were related - he might have been explaining to the girl about how the military was his best opportunity to get post high school education and training, given his situation, but I'm not sure cause the details of the conversation have gotten fuzzy.<br/><br/>I really wish that when I read "cultural expressions filtered through Black Media" that what I assumed was an attempt to act more like this high school kid. Cause he was one of my favorite people I've met this year, even though I only had the opportunity to talk to him for a few minutes. He exuded a confidence that in no way felt like the tough guy scowl I see on many of the other train riders (and which I understand - a commuter train full of strangers is not a good place to put your victim face on).<br/><br/>I wish that my assumption was that, by Black Media, you meant awesome positive black role models like Danzel Washington and Will Smith and Barack Obama, cause those are some excellent black men in media.<br/><br/>But my assumption instead focuses on what I see reflected in those tough guy scowlers that I see much more often on the train. I think of rap songs full of violent content and sexism and anti-intellectualism. I think about gangs and violence and needlessly confrontational behavior.<br/><br/>I have another story that, I hope, sheds some light on my negative reaction to gangs and violence.<br/><br/>Last December I took off early from work, picked up my son, and went with some of my friends to go play Laser Tag at an indoor arena place. After we played for a couple hours, we went across the street to eat at a Baja Fresh before heading home. When I got to the front of the line, a guy who had already ordered crossed back across the front of the line and glared at me. He was Hispanic and wearing vaguely gang related clothes \u2013 baggy shorts with white socks up to his knees, a team jersey and a wide brimmed baseball cap with the big foil sticker on it. He said \u201cThat\u2019s right, faggot. You got a problem?\u201d I said \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Do you?\u201d His eyes seemed kind of twitchy \u2013 he wasn\u2019t drunk or on pot, but he might have been on a stimulant like meth or something. For clarification, I\u2019m hetero and give no indication that I\u2019m aware of otherwise, so I don\u2019t really think he was being homophobic, but it\u2019s within the realm of possibility that he was and he misidentified me. Overall, I don\u2019t know why he picked me as a target, and it\u2019s baffled me and the friends I was with ever since. Anyway, I placed my order and sat down. He picked up his order at the counter and was walking toward the front instead of the side door, which took him right by where I sat next to the aisle. When he got to me, he sucker punched me \u2013 an upper cut that split my eyebrow wide. I chased after him and tried to get him back, but I was too stunned and blurry to be effective. He ended up getting away. I gave statements to the cops, but because it would have been misdemeanor assault, they weren\u2019t able to get a warrant to track him through his girlfriend\u2019s credit card he\u2019d used to pay for the food. I ended up with 13 stitches above my eye. Fortunately, I got really lucky with the emergency room doctor who did exceptional work and the scarring is pretty minimal already.<br/><br/>When I first started riding the train a couple months later, having started a new job, I would have mild anxiety attacks when I\u2019d see guys wearing big baggy clothes and a tough guy attitude. It still makes me nervous sometimes. Sometimes I put my headphones on and close my eyes and just ignore it. Sometimes, well one time, I got into a conversation with a kid who was black and who was awesome.<br/><br/>So when you said you were expressing yourself through Black Media, my fear associated it with violence and gang mentality. Because I associate that Hispanic guy who randomly assaulted me more strongly with Black Media than with Hispanic Media \u2013 to be honest, I would see him as a Hispanic who expresses himself through Black Media, though I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a name for that. I don\u2019t know if that makes perfect sense. But there\u2019s some emotion stuff mixing in with my logic stuff \u2013 my lizard brain gets activated more than it used to when I think about this kind of stuff right now \u2013 so I may be making associations that won\u2019t always hold true. <br/><br/>I really want to work through that assumption. I want to have less negative assumptions when I think about phrases like Black Media. Right now it\u2019s hard. I have some emotional scars that are as present as the scar on my face.<br/><br/>And I thank you for your responses. They\u2019ve given me more insight and will hopefully be one of the things that helps me heal. I hope I haven\u2019t wounded you in return by exposing my negative reaction, which I hope I have shown is not entirely baseless and have demonstrated my ongoing efforts to work through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376196/#Comment_376196" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T11:47:13+00:00" title="May  3, 2012 11:47AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite> my negative reaction, which I hope I have shown is not entirely baseless</blockquote>\nThis, right here, is the problem. The idea that assume anything you just said about your personal experiences (and, for real, I am sorry you got assaulted, that sucks) is any kind of a basis for any sort of judgement about what black media is about.<br/><br/>Look, I'll give you credit here. Clearly you're making an effort. It's good that you're identifying you're assumptions AS assumptions. It's good that you say you want to change your assumptions. And the instinctive feelings of fear you identify are totally common; I'm happy to admit that I myself have similar instinctive fear reactions. But the important thing is that you absolutely must recognise that no amount of personal anecdote or lizard brain reaction is even a tiny bit of a legitimate basis for your negative reaction here in this thread to the concept of black media.<br/><br/>Also: listen to better rap music already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376197/#Comment_376197" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T11:51:07+00:00" title="May  3, 2012 11:51AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>Let me start with a story.

Read up on it. In particular, the Biden/Obama debacle of 2007.<br/><br/>I hadn't been aware that it was a trigger word. Thanks for bringing me up to speed.<br/><br/>It's a word I use all the time to differentiate people I interact with who are particularly well spoken. One of the things I like about the group of people that I now work with is that they are much more articulate, as a group, than the people at my last few workplaces.<br/><br/>My reason for using the word had much much much more to do with his youth than his being black. Between his conversation about goals and his appearance, I'd peg him at 17. And I'm pleasantly surprised when a 17 year old communicates with me eloquently and avoids slang and demonstrates a substantial vocabulary and, in particular, clearly articulates his words - teenagers are notorious for mumbling, slurring, or otherwise speaking in a way that adds a layer of difficulty to communication. This particular teenager had noticably exceptional pronunciation and diction, which I would have noted in any teen. <br/><br/>Hell, I regularly notice it in adults when it stands out. At my last workplace, there was a noticable lack of articulate communication. My boss was a Chinese man who, in addition to being a second language speaker, was also not an expert in communicating in his own language - a couple of the other guys on the team spoke Chinese and would have a conversation with the boss in Chinese and still not clearly know what he wanted them to do. He was one of those people who had a hard time externalizing their ideas through speech and writing, and the language hiccups just exacerbated the issue. So I would definitely not call him articulate, and I wish he had been. A couple of the other team members were noticably more articulate than average for the team. They were white, but so were some of the less articulate people.<br/><br/>So in my personal use, I don't mean "for a black person" or "for a minority" or anything like that when I note that someone is articulate. In this particular instance, I meant "for a 17 year old" more than anything. At my last job, I would have meant "compared to the rest of this team, that sucks at communicating more than any group of adults I've worked with for an extended period to date".<br/><br/>But, thanks to your pointing it out, I now know that this is a issue word for some people. I will do my best in the future to be more aware of that context when using it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376212/#Comment_376212" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T12:45:59+00:00" title="May  3, 2012 12:45PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Personally, it looks like Rob's working trough something that shoul have been private, was not, and now we're on Lap Three of this kinda uncomfortable (not because of the issues, but because it so personally pertains to one person, and is capital-P Personal).

Let me take this slowly.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>I really wish that when I read "cultural expressions filtered through Black Media" that what I assumed was an attempt to act more like this high school kid. Cause he was one of my favorite people I've met this year, even though I only had the opportunity to talk to him for a few minutes. He exuded a confidence that in no way felt like the tough guy scowl I see on many of the other train riders (and which I understand - a commuter train full of strangers is not a good place to put your victim face on).</blockquote>\nI, uh \u2026 I was just \u2026 talking about hip hop and \u2026\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>I wish that my assumption was that, by Black Media, you meant awesome positive black role models like Danzel Washington and Will Smith and Barack Obama, cause those are some excellent black men in media.</blockquote>\nYeah, they're pretty good role models. Who are your favorite positive white role models? Personally, I think that John Stavropoulos is a pretty excellent white man, and I wish more white people acted like him. He's clean, articulate, and friendly to people of other races. In fact, he is married to one! He is not a member of any Nazi militias, evil multinational corporations, or other negative influences which often drag white people down. Some people consider his Greek ancestry to mark him only as \u201cquasi-white,\u201d but I think that we should count him, because young white men need every good example they can get.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>But my assumption instead focuses on what I see reflected in those tough guy scowlers that I see much more often on the train. I think of rap songs full of violent content and sexism and anti-intellectualism. I think about gangs and violence and needlessly confrontational behavior.</blockquote>\nWhy?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>I have another story that, I hope, sheds some light on my negative reaction to gangs and violence.<br/></blockquote>\nI also have a pretty negative reaction to gangs and violence, as do almost all of the people I know, so I\u2019m down with you there.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>Last December I took off early from work, picked up my son, and went with some of my friends to go play Laser Tag at an indoor arena place. After we played for a couple hours, we went across the street to eat at a Baja Fresh before heading home. When I got to the front of the line, a guy who had already ordered crossed back across the front of the line and glared at me. He was Hispanic and wearing vaguely gang related clothes \u2013 baggy shorts with white socks up to his knees, a team jersey and a wide brimmed baseball cap with the big foil sticker on it. He said \u201cThat\u2019s right, faggot. You got a problem?\u201d I said \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Do you?\u201d His eyes seemed kind of twitchy \u2013 he wasn\u2019t drunk or on pot, but he might have been on a stimulant like meth or something. For clarification, I\u2019m hetero and give no indication that I\u2019m aware of otherwise, so I don\u2019t really think he was being homophobic, but it\u2019s within the realm of possibility that he was and he misidentified me. Overall, I don\u2019t know why he picked me as a target, and it\u2019s baffled me and the friends I was with ever since. Anyway, I placed my order and sat down. He picked up his order at the counter and was walking toward the front instead of the side door, which took him right by where I sat next to the aisle. When he got to me, he sucker punched me \u2013 an upper cut that split my eyebrow wide. I chased after him and tried to get him back, but I was too stunned and blurry to be effective. He ended up getting away. I gave statements to the cops, but because it would have been misdemeanor assault, they weren\u2019t able to get a warrant to track him through his girlfriend\u2019s credit card he\u2019d used to pay for the food. I ended up with 13 stitches above my eye. Fortunately, I got really lucky with the emergency room doctor who did exceptional work and the scarring is pretty minimal already.</blockquote>\nThat\u2019s awful, and I\u2019m really sorry it happened to you, but what does any of that have to do with gangs?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>When I first started riding the train a couple months later, having started a new job, I would have mild anxiety attacks when I\u2019d see guys wearing big baggy clothes and a tough guy attitude. It still makes me nervous sometimes. Sometimes I put my headphones on and close my eyes and just ignore it. Sometimes, well one time, I got into a conversation with a kid who was black and who was awesome.</blockquote>\nYour story actually sounds really familiar. My father had a similar one. He often lamented that, in spite of his commitment to liberalism in general and the Democratic Party in particular, he was pretty inherently homophobic and racist. I asked him once why he thought he was racist, and he explained simply that when he was a kid growing up in a Jewish neighborhood in Flatbush, groups of Black boys would come over to his neighborhood and beat him up before going back to their homes. This wasn\u2019t a particularly racially charged action, coming as it did from a time (the 1930s) when groups of boys beat each other up all the time for no reason, and it was much weirder not to get in fights like this, but my dad still grew up associating Black people with beating up little kids. For the record, during my dad\u2019s childhood, groups of Jewish kids would also go over to other neighborhoods in Brooklyn to beat up individuals of whatever ethnicity lived there, but my dad elected not to participate.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>So when you said you were expressing yourself through Black Media, my fear associated it with violence and gang mentality. Because I associate that Hispanic guy who randomly assaulted me more strongly with Black Media than with Hispanic Media \u2013 to be honest, I would see him as a Hispanic who expresses himself through Black Media, though I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a name for that. I don\u2019t know if that makes perfect sense. But there\u2019s some emotion stuff mixing in with my logic stuff \u2013 my lizard brain gets activated more than it used to when I think about this kind of stuff right now \u2013 so I may be making associations that won\u2019t always hold true.</blockquote>\nAs a Hispanic who expresses himself through Black media as well as an Asian who expresses himself through Black media, I can safely say I have no idea what to call that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>I really want to work through that assumption. I want to have less negative assumptions when I think about phrases like Black Media. Right now it\u2019s hard. I have some emotional scars that are as present as the scar on my face.</blockquote>\nThank you for sharing all this material. I know it must be hard.<br/><br/>Your post is one of the most alarmingly racist things I\u2019ve read in a long time. I say that with no rancor, it\u2019s just fact: you\u2019ve managed somehow to generalize from one terrible experience you had with a single Hispanic kid all the way to fear of Black individuals and Black media and gangs and violence and all kinds of things which are logically disconnected from the original experience\u2014a generalization which is honestly pretty normal and common, though not good. It is because of experiences like yours that the anthropologist Clifford Geertz exhorts us to generalize only within cases, not from case to culture.<br/><br/>But yeah, you\u2019re positing a worldview in which Black people and Black expressions are points on a scatter graph plotted out in, on the one hand, negative experiences which aren\u2019t even with Black people and Black media, and on the other hand remote individuals such as President Obama who have to prove themselves against a background of assumed negativity. Blacks are all of these things before they are people, and a rap song is all of these things before it is a song. And this worldview isn\u2019t scary because it\u2019s peculiar to you, Rob\u2014it\u2019s scary because <b>it\u2019s the mainstream one.</b> The one most people in America have. This worldview is the source of a great deal of the disadvantage Blacks face in America today.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>And I thank you for your responses. They\u2019ve given me more insight and will hopefully be one of the things that helps me heal. I hope I haven\u2019t wounded you in return by exposing my negative reaction, which I hope I have shown is not entirely baseless and have demonstrated my ongoing efforts to work through.</blockquote>\nYou\u2019re welcome. Thank you for yours as well.<br/><br/>You seem to be aware that you are racist, which is an important first step. I note that I am racist nearly every day, usually while making fun of people of other races (this generally takes place at my d\u014dj\u014d, and results in retaliatory punching on all sides). You also seem aware that your viewpoint is an emotional extrapolation via anecdotal evidence, confirmation bias, conflation of multiple Others, and other logical fallacies which you probably know much better than I do. I\u2019m glad that you found the \u201carticulate\u201d thing, too, as I get incoherent, ironically enough, every time I try to explain it; there\u2019s probably a productive conversation about slang versus ruling-class-correct speech in there somewhere.<br/><br/>But yeah, the path to enlightenment and acceptance isn\u2019t even through changing how you feel, although that would be nice; if we could change how we feel about things, then, well, SentientGames might be right about not being offended. If you recognize that the connections you\u2019re making are fucked up, that the generalizations you\u2019re making are inappropriate and untrue, and that it\u2019s worthwhile to listen to others who think differently and make different assumptions, that\u2019s already a lot more than many people are doing. I could go on to recommend some blogs or other reading materials but even I will admit that\u2019s beyond the scope of this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376219/#Comment_376219" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T13:06:33+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  1:06PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2012 1:07PM by Lula.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a closing note, I would like to state that I wish that SentientGames had been around 112 years ago, to tell my ancestors what should and shouldn\u2019t offend them.

If you have a bunch of old letters and stuff that are fragile and aren't easily available, instead of just reading them at the archive and writing your analysis, you could scan them all and publish a book of them, with your own notes and annotations included. It would still be less expensive than a ton of university press books, which end up being a hundred bucks each or so and only libraries ever buy them. Not much of that, though, sadly.</blockquote>\nBecause it's a lot of work that doesn't contribute to your career. Peer reviewed publishing is essential to the academic tenure process.

He is not a member of any Nazi militias, evil multinational corporations, or other negative influences which often drag white people down.
