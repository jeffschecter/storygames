These are re-filled only upon reaching a new level (and not, as per original DCC, by being awarded a few points for playing according to alignment, as determined by the GM at the end of each adventure).<br/><br/>At levels 1-5, Luck points may be added to attacks, ability checks and skill checks (after the d20 roll).<br/><br/>From level 6 onwards, Luck points may also be used defensively, i.e. they may be added to saves, prevent the character from falling under 0 hit points, reduce critical hits and so on (always on a 1:1 basis). DCC-as-written allows defensive use from the get-go, which makes low-level lethality too low, in my opinion. Level 6 is a very big deal in my rules and also constitutes "name-level".<br/><br/>In my view, the disadvantages of this mechanic are that (a) it's a metagame mechanic (atypical for old school D&amp;D) and (b) it creates or deepens the divide between PCs and NPCs (as Luck is only for the former). However, I wanted to have the following effects:<br/><br/>1. <b>Increasing the survivability of high-level characters</b> to get to the fabled 'end-game' (building castles etc.). This has definitely been achieved, though a natural 1 cannot be alleviated by Luck, so save-or-die effects are still plenty scary. We've had several high-level deaths recently so that the current quest is on hold while the players try to level up a new party to get reinforcements. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>2. <b>Allowing players to retire a cherished character</b> when Luck starts to run out. So far, none of the players have done this.<br/><br/>3. <b>Discouraging high-level characters from going on low-level adventures</b> (with or without low-level adventurers) because these do contain grave threats (e.g. bottomless pits) and Luck is just too valuable to blow on a low-level dungeon. <br/><br/><b>Luck points work like a kind of 'permanent' hit points, i.e. the same old dramatic clock on a different scale (per quest rather than per combat).</b><br/><br/>An unlooked-for side effect is that <b>Luck makes low-level characters much more viable in a high-level party</b>. In these circumstances, low-level character gain levels quickly (on account of the high amounts of treasure) but usually several tries (i.e. characters) are needed to get to mid-levels because high-level combat is very deadly to low-level characters. Even when they are not seen as worth targeting, many die to area effects (breath weapons, <i>cloudkill</i> etc.). Luck does not help with this, but with the next level just around the corner, it can be spent with abandon, occasionally bridging the gap in competence (to some extent, anyway).<br/><br/>(So I'm not such a radical killer DM after all\u2026 )<br/><br/>Anyway, what are your experiences with the survivability of mid- or high-level characters in non-illusionist D&amp;D? Do you allow <i>raise dead</i>, have a mechanic similar to Eero's proposal, rarely reach high levels etc.?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474151/#Comment_474151" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-24T18:14:36+00:00" title="May 24, 2018  6:14PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2018 6:30PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is that I have relatively little experience with mid-level play, and none at all for high-level [grin]. As I've often said, it seems pretty consistent in my experience of legit play that a fresh group takes like 20 sessions to achieve 2nd level, and 50 sessions for mid-level play to emerge. My longest-running campaign arc was still clearly mid-level at session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23100&amp;Mode=like">#100</a>.<br/><br/>In general I think that survivability is a largely mechanical matter - it depends on what I consider the lowest-order concern in D&amp;D; the actual, practical mechanical conceits your campaign uses. Your Luck mechanic is a good example of something that affects survivability greatly. I have a similar conceit in my house rules in the form of "death save crosses" (not a great name, I just call them "cross-marks" in Finnish) that allow higher-leveled characters to essentially get more grievously injured before they give up and die. So unlike you I don't decrease the probability of the save-or-die, but I rather allow the character to survive more "dies" without actually dying - different feel but the same ultimate outcome, as mid-levelers are more unlikely to die. (I also get legit retirement with my mechanic, as characters suffer and survive grievous injuries like loss of stats, limbs, senses, etc. that make adventuring unfeasible.)<br/><br/>With that in mind (and of course different mechanizations cancel out in various ways - my homebrew is in some ways more lethal and in some ways less than orthodox D&amp;D), I would characterize the robustness of mid-level characters as meaningful. The big, fat, dramatic edge they have is that they don't simply quit and die the first time an enemy succeeds in an attack and lands a powerful blow. They also often have better adventure hooks due to strategic positioning (this is my real gauge for when you've "arrived" as a mid-level adventurer), but on a strictly tactical level the better hit point total pays off constantly.<br/><br/>Our historical D&amp;D stuff doesn't feature raise dead as a pre-existing thing in the game world. If anybody ever got a cleric-type character to a high enough level to cast something like that, I probably would allow it - the PCs are doing stuff that doesn't exist in the setting all the time anyway. I would be likely to rethink the spell somewhat, though, because I abhor the idea of building a mechanical "backstop" that cements high-level achievement. Maybe require a short-but-risky adventure to Hell to retrieve the dear departed (the spell merely opens a portal to the right place and takes care of the divine paperwork, so to speak), and they lose 10 000 xp even if they're successfully retrieved. (Implies that you can't resurrect a low-level character at all - not enough xp.) Something like that.<br/><br/>(We've had characters <i>speculate</i> about resurrecting comrades, but nobody's seriously tried so far. The play culture is not sufficiently rooted in D&amp;D for the players to seriously entertain the idea that you could just cast a spell to do it - they pretty much assume that it's going to be like Orpheus and Eurydice or something like that if they'd try it. The closest we've come has been when a character got taken to the afterworld alive once, resulting in them having to adventure their way out.)<br/><br/>Considering the general design position, I think that high-level characters should be much more robust than low-level to ensure that their deaths are more meaningful - not in a dramatic sense, but strictly as a matter of resource expenditure. It should not be trivial to neutralize a high-level threat, because "high-level" doesn't mean much of anything aside from this very particular wargaming concern. Going against a high-level character in D&amp;D <i>should</i> mean that you prepare to triple-kill them, hack the body apart and bury the pieces with garlic, if that's what it takes to make sure of the job. Everything in the game and the typical rules and rulings builds in this direction. (I do not wish to imply an absolute formalism in this: if you can be clever and get a cheap kill, by all means - but you have to work around the intentionally formidable mechanical privileges the system grant to high-levelers, and I don't want to leave trivial short-cuts.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474152/#Comment_474152" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-24T18:18:32+00:00" title="May 24, 2018  6:18PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My 5e dungeon crawl game, in its 25-30th two-hour session now, has characters reaching 5th level.

Eero and Adam Dray have both sort of suggested frameworks that the simple spell doesn't fit into\u2014making quests or stories of a certain kind. But why is this in question for you?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there's something I do agree with very strongly there\u2014that it is good an appropriate for high level characters to have some mechanism for avoiding death, sometime in the ballpark of level 6. What drives you to invent a new system to replace this perfectly serviceable spell that comes online when the fastest-levelling class reaches level 7?<br/><br/>That said: in my game we back-ported the constitution loss and system shock checks of AD&amp;D into and OD&amp;D framework; you have to make a roll-under constitution check with 2d6 as you are brought back so it's not endless. I've also made NPC Clerics quite unusual in most places, only found in holy orders. But journeying to the underworld is certainly on the table, and players gain access to spells to pierce worlds at the same times (<em>Conjure Evil</em>, the reverse of <em>Dispel Evil</em>, could easily summon Charon on an appropriate waterway, for instance) as well as simply having access to them through the dungeon.<br/><br/>I think OD&amp;D has <em>Flesh to Stone</em> specifically for this purpose also\u2014the cure is essentially never to be cast by the PCs except perhaps from a hard-won scroll, but much more likely cast in exchange for a <em>Geas</em> from some wizard with their own agenda.<br/><br/>In any case, yes\u2014in a sandbox game the high HP survivability of these characters is a specific tool to make them the centre, for the first time, of plots and stories. The great thing is that no one needs to plan them because by the time a character has survived 50+ sessions they are almost guaranteed to be entangled in a variety of ongoing situations among monsters, strange spellcasters, local politics, or foreign patrons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474179/#Comment_474179" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-26T06:45:41+00:00" title="May 26, 2018  6:45AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2018 6:45AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/adamwb" rel="nofollow">adamwb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think to me the question is: why wouldn't you?

Of course every part of the game should be examined in itself. I just am curious about the impulse to take out this mechanic and replace it with another mechanic. The stuff you are talking about, Eero, is largely replacing it with an adventure-driven solution.<br/><br/>I think this approach would make the most sense if for example you are trying to create a pulpy no-clerics campaign\u2014you then have a desire to figure out what mechanical things Clerics do that you need to keep the game functioning and find ways to put those tools in the hands of other classes.<br/><br/>I actually often think about spells and magic items in terms of tools for replacing adventure solutions as the party gains levels. To me it seems right that the party should be able to potentially travel to the underworld and bargain, or pay some other due to a wizard, in order to raise the dead indirectly well before it becomes available to them as a spell, but at a certain point I like that spells offer a quick mechanical solution as their position and goals change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474192/#Comment_474192" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-27T05:03:49+00:00" title="May 27, 2018  5:03AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2018 5:08AM by Johann.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/adamwb" rel="nofollow">adamwb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Rereading the first post in this thread and this stands out to me:<br/><br/>Do you allow raise dead<br/><br/>I think to me the question is: why wouldn't you? </p></div></blockquote>\nGood catch!

Spells such as <i>invisibility</i>,<i> fly</i>, <i>leomund's secure shelter</i>, or <i>teleport</i> come to mind immediately, as do items like bags of holding etc. That said, I'd examine these very carefully and discard or modify (or consciously choose to include) them for any given campaign. They certainly have a lot more impact on adventure solutions and the world at large (e.g. architecture) than, say, <i>melf's acid arrow</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474237/#Comment_474237" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-29T16:09:12+00:00" title="May 29, 2018  4:09PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Guy Srinivasan" rel="nofollow">Guy Srinivasan</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"When you literally hold the power of life and death in your hands" loses a lot of its weight when resurrection is on the table.

Why won't that NPC wield the power lightly? The answer can't be "because the power of life and death is <i>omg heavy</i>", since if all NPCs with that power commoditized it and did in fact wield the power lightly then the power of life and death would suddenly be a lot less heavy.<br/><br/>Cultural/religion? Economics will trump it. Good: "I demand you go on a quest to heal these villagers!" ==&gt; Evil: "I just demand you insult this puppy and compensate me for time, materials, and the expense I incurred to learn this power, how 'bout me." ==&gt; Good: "Okay fine you can compliment the puppy and compensate me accordingly, please stop patronizing Evil's business."<br/><br/>Scarcity? Could work, basically there's not enough competition to drive the price down so you can moralize all you want. I wonder how the scarcity is maintained... "Good: sure I'll rez your friend, just go kill the other NPC who can rez who happens to be Evil... mmm, thanks."<br/><br/>Price? I don't think that's the fix you want, right? Players will just forgo a bit of other stuff to save enough for rez'n.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474242/#Comment_474242" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-29T18:27:10+00:00" title="May 29, 2018  6:27PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure anything is broken. I generally let my players have the spells, if they reach those levels. By that time, they're part of organizations with a hierarchy and responsibilities. No murder hobos here.<br/><br/>So if the players are a wildcard and cast the spell how they like, there can be consequences for it. <br/><br/>I'm saying that the power of life and death is <i>not</i> commoditized. Not that many NPCs have the levels and training to cast <i>raise dead</i>. It's a scarce power. <br/><br/>It's also not much different than any other high level spell that PCs want NPCs to cast. If the party wants something that not everyone has, and they ask a high level NPC for it, then the NPC will probably demand something in return, unless giving it to them for free suits their personal agenda.<br/><br/>Are you running campaigns with dozens of 9th level clerics in each city? And they cast <i>raise dead</i>, for free, with no agenda? I just find it hard to believe that clerics, who are ultimately religious zealots, just cast that kind of thing without strings attached. At the very least, are you an adherent of their religion? They're not the Wal-Mart of healing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474243/#Comment_474243" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-29T18:46:33+00:00" title="May 29, 2018  6:46PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to agree with Adam Dray here; high-level NPC clerics are scarce enough in most settings that I think the GM can make them behave however he wants for the story. If you don't like it, then get your cleric character up to 9th level and see how they behave.<br/><br/>I will note that in the non-OSR game <i>Godbound</i> a character who starts with the Word of Death can fairly trivially resurrect any ordinary NPC who hasn't been dead for very long, but not other Godbound PC's.  It has a big effect on the game ("I'll tell the King if that if he lets me into the castle and gives me the orb, I'll resurrect everyone who just died in the last scene!"), but it doesn't seem to break it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
