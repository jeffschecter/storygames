I'm thinking a lot about Deadlands for inspiration, but maybe divorced from the metaplot a bit (a lot of a bit). I mostly like Hucksters using cards as spell foci and some historical stuff, like the Sioux and Texas Rangers and the Pinkertons.<br/><br/>Can we brainstorm this? Are people interested in helping? Are people interested in playing? I'm running an online AW game (a month or two old), a tabletop AW game (we're about to play session 2), and participating in a Google Wave AW game (a little more than a month old, I think). I have some experience but not a lot.<br/><br/>Any of you wastelanders out there wanna talk this out and get a task force started? I'll get started with my mission stated upfront:<br/><br/>A Weird West alternative history hack for Apocalypse World, equal parts Deadlands and Deadwood.<br/><br/>Ready go!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289082/#Comment_289082" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T23:28:40+00:00" title="August 26, 2010 11:28PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool.

It wouldn't take much doing to write a short amount about what thematic things need changing, do a bit of name-swapping, and play a Weird West game.<br/><br/>Michael Pfaff over at the Barf Forth fora has started a "straight" western hack called Western World, and I think I would call mine Weird West World or something totally uncreative and seek out his assistance for getting a more proper hack put together (with a modified set of Principles, Agenda, and Moves both MC and Player). I asked him for help and for some of his material. I'm hoping to have custom classes like Huckster and Texas Ranger and Pinkerton along with Gunslinger (Gunlugger mod) and some straight class swiping (as someone already pointed out, the Maestro D' can be used basically as written), to name a few items off my list of wants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289115/#Comment_289115" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T06:28:13+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  6:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joey,<br/>\n<br/>\nI got your message and I'm totally down with you stealing liberally from anything I produce and put your "weird" spin on it.

I read a comic book called "Daisy Kutter: The Last Train" which was set in a Wild West setting with tin-man like robots. It had tons of awesome in it, and I fell in love. Also there was that movie many years ago called Wild Wild West, which wasn't all that great except that it had lots of nifty machinery in it. Also I love steampunk, so it makes perfect sense that there should be a steampunky Wild West too. PLUS, on top of all that, my own imagination just starts dancing imagining what the Maelstrom might look like in a Weird West Apocalypse World. <br><br>Here are some ideas about characters in this setting, off the top of my head:<br><br>Brainer: A blind cowboy or cowgirl type, kind of like the blind Jedi guys from Knights of the Old Republic 2, who can see just fine without eyes, because they see through the eyes of other people, or animals, or insects, or the wind, or the <i>waaallllls</i>. Sometimes they'll be young and spooky, other times they'll be old and bizarre, covered in layers of clothing.<br/><br/>Driver: Instead of a car, he gets a pilotable robot machine. Maybe mecha.<br/><br/>Gunlugger: Like a gunslinger, but with an elegant gun the size of a huge samurai sword, wielded with precision. Plus mini-guns stashed everywhere.<br/><br/>Savvyhead: Workshop includes the ability to make robots, potions, or whatever sorts of weird stuff you think is cool.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
