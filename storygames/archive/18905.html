To broaden our horizon of what is and might be possible and what has already been attempted, and what has succeeded or even failed - and why.<br/>In several little tasks you'll analyze and practice storytelling on your own and in teams.<br/><br/>Why this MOOC is Interdisciplinary<br/>Based at the Design Department at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, this MOOC is not only interdisciplinary, but also includes guest lectures and project presentations by game designers, writers, transmedia producers, TV makers, executives and theorists from many different fields of study. We will thus be able to discuss content, structures and technologies from various perspectives.<br/><br/>Learning Outcomes<br/>Our MOOC will help you answer the following questions:<br/>1. How do fictional stories work? Which structures and mechanics are used?<br/>2. How do new technologies influence the ways stories are told and perceived - and which new media formats have been developed during the last years?<br/>3. How can technologies, interfaces and visuals engage an audience fast and continuously?<br/>4. How can I develop and implement my own story-ideas - on my own or in teams?<br/><br/>Prior Knowledge<br/>No prior knowledge of storytelling mechanics is needed, but can be helpful.<br/>Interest in creative processes and new technologies is welcome and encouraged.<br/>- You don't know what an alternate-reality game, RPG or transmedia storytelling is? - Great, you'll learn it here.<br/>- You are a storytelling professional? - Great, we hope to inspire you.
