I had never played a game that didn't use dice and I was quite pleased how much I enjoyed the experience. So it got me thinking, I could make a game without dice and is simple and easy to play, or so I thought.<br/><br/>So this week I spent a few hours putting together my initial ideas and game mechanics into a document and thought what better place to share it to get useful and positive criticism than here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So here is my "alpha playtest document", or something like that. It borrows heavily from Mouse Guard, Lady Blackbird, Fiasco, Apocalypse World, FATE, and of course Amber. If you have time to check it out, I'd love to hear what you think. This isn't something I plan to release, just a fun simple game I felt inspired to create. Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>Pheylorn<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O-Rp1L85wpxqPnHgssTQtfKeE2AXxkWMWHJs2GkbILc/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O-Rp1L85wpxqPnHgssTQtfKeE2AXxkWMWHJs2GkbILc/edit</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388057/#Comment_388057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T08:48:24+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  8:48AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see the Amber in it. The Story Points make it possible to overcome obstacles that your character could not normally and that works. I think the thing that makes diceless difficult for me to enjoy is the predictability. If I know your stats and I know how many SP you have, it becomes cut and dry what you can accomplish. <br/><br/>I see some of the mechanisms you've built in to make the SP available to the player more variable based on what the other characters want to accomplish or like. That helps, I guess it depends on how reliable and predictable your friends are. In this case, the more reliable or predictable your friends are the less interesting the game is.<br/><br/>It's not just your diceless system, I have a similar complaint for most diceless games. It would be cool to see some way of introducing unpredictability to the contests even without a randomizer. I have my own method for this but if you're interested in the challenge, I'd like to see how others would handle it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388060/#Comment_388060" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T09:00:17+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  9:00AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I completely understand your concerns with diceless games. Having barely played any I really don't know if this sort of thing will be my cup of tea or my group's either, but I wanted to give it a go and see how it feels. If it becomes stagnant then I will end it and move on to other ideas. If it works though, then that's cool and I'm happy. <br/><br/>I really appreciate the feedback, you've given me angles to consider I might not otherwise have.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388062/#Comment_388062" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T09:23:21+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  9:23AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Understand, I'm not trying to discourage you in any way. The system as is could be 100% functional especially if the unpredictability came from the story, to encourage that might be a good goal. Maybe if a player surprises the GM or another player it could get them an SP.<br/><br/>Another way is to make the options available to the players so numerous that it's difficult to track. That approach has it's own hazards but it's the one I went for.<br/><br/>Yet another might be to amp up the role play even more, the players could attempt to out describe the scene vs other player (this would be brutal being GM). The more complete the description, the harder it is for the other player to beat them. For example, I explain how I sneak into the room not making a sound when your back is turned and stab you. But you describe that the wine glass you were drinking out of acted as an imperfect mirror, but it was enough to warn you of my presence and you turn and smash the wine glass in my face. Understanding what could be vetoed and who gets to describe for how long is the real trick there but not impossible.<br/><br/>Just some ideas that could really spice up the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388125/#Comment_388125" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T14:46:37+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  2:46PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think refresh scenes, trust scenes, 'thematic scenes', are an underexplored mechanic.<br/><br/>Dig it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388136/#Comment_388136" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T16:03:44+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  4:03PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think refresh scenes, trust scenes, 'thematic scenes', are an underexplored mechanic.<br/><br/>Dig it.</blockquote>\nThanks mate.
