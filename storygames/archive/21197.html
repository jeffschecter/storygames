Which sounds easy, right? But then, your target or their guards may also have super-powers, and weapons are rather lethal...<br/><br/>Time is limited, your power is limited and your ammunition is limited... will you be able to complete your contract in time? It's already Funded, so I hope you'll consider joining us to find out:<br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/era-hitman-paperback" rel="nofollow">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadesofvengeance/era-hitman-paperback</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
