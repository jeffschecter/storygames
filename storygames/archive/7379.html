Both Kevin and I had people say they heard about our books from Robin and that's why they were looking at them.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI lifted this comment from Gregor from this thread here:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7375&amp;page=1#Item_13" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7375&amp;page=1#Item_13</a><br/><br/>The relevant idea behind the thread is that Gregor felt that because 3:16 was mentioned on a few podcasts, he got a sales bump.<br/><br/>From those of you who have been on podcasts, do you see your numbers go up because you were on the show?  For those who listener to podcasts, do you follow through on product recommendations from podcasts?  Any stories good or bad about what podcasting has done?<br/><br/>As a podcaster, is there anything I should consider which might make the overall experience better for listeners and game designers?  Obviously I don't want to shill (all mentions of Echoes from the Rifts aside) or just blabber on about a game, but part of what I hope I do is provide a symobiotic relationship with my guests.  I help them talk about their product, they help me get listeners who are interested in hearing my interviews.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164209/#Comment_164209" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T14:40:34+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  2:40PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an avid listener of podcasts I certainly follow through on product reviews and recommendations I hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to hear both thoughtful reviews and interviews with designers/developers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164213/#Comment_164213" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T14:47:20+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  2:47PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 2:47PM by Daniel_M_Perez.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Taking my own podcaster hat off, through podcasting I came to find this group of people and this type of games (me listening to OgreCave early last year: "Wait, you play a dog running around in a vineyard? What the hell kind of game is that?!") and over time, through reviews, and especially interviews, I have been made aware, made interested and made crazy for a number of games. So yeah, they work, a lot. Especially for this smaller segment of the gaming industry (though the larger companies aren't complaining either).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.
