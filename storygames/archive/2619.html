I think your Identity/Community and Fate/Free Will dichotomies are spot-on for the game.  I don't know if I'd forge such a strong link between Sacrifice and Revenge, though.  Sacrifice is certainly a major portion of the game (Blood and Sacrifice!), but explicitly linking it to one purpose dilutes the impact, for me.  In my mind, all the Revenge stuff was in there as a decoy and catspaw.  In the end, if the Eighth Tribe was going to ever actually <em>fix</em> anything, they would have to overcome their (justified) desire for revenge and find a way to work with their "enemies" -- the Great Architecture is not something that can be fixed without the cooperation of the Tribals, the Fatimas, and even the Z'bri.  Said fixing would necessitate big gobs of Sacrifice on everybody's part, but Revenge would be disastrously counterproductive to that effort.  So Revenge is a big part of the game, but I think it's there as a hurdle, not as a cornerstone.  My own little mental motto for the game was, "In Tribe 8, nothing is ever accomplished without sacrifice."<br/><br/>Note that this is similar but different than "What are you willing to give to get what you want?" as seen in <em>Sorcerer</em> and <em>Dogs</em>.  This is more "Will you give up what is necessary to do what must be done?"  Part of this is echoes of the publishing model, if you can believe it.  <em>Sorcerer</em> is a self-contained game that wants players to take it and run with it.  It doesn't care what you want and it doesn't care what you're willing to give, it just wants you to get to the point where you can ask questions about it.  By contrast, <em>Tribe 8</em> is a game designed to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">sell sourcebooks</span> be continually supported by new material.  It very much does care about controlling what must be done and what the price will be, because it needed to include those things in the books that came after it.  In <em>Tribe 8</em>, the world is unbalanced, it is unbalanced in a specific way, the player characters must re-balance the world, and they must re-balance it in a specific way.  While it isn't so annoyingly specific that it leads to PC/GM guessing games, there is a "correct answer" to Tribe 8 -- and the correct answer is all encoded in the Prophecy of Joshua, along with the entire (projected) line of sourcebooks that were intended to support that correct answer.<br/><br/>Which makes a "story games" version of Tribe 8 problematic.  The "correct answer" thing is not something well-supported by story games as a genre.  Story games are more likely to let the PCs figure out whatever answer works for them, and make sure that the GM complicates and threatens that answer until everybody reaches catharsis.  Implementing that structure in a Tribe 8 game, however, is going to have some pretty deep ramifications to how the game plays out.  The strident, insistent, and terrifying gordian knot of a crisis in the original game loses a lot of its bite when any suitably baroque solution will do.  Which gets around to your third point, the Free Will / Fate dichotomy.  I don't know if story games can really support much fate, in simplest terms.  The distance between player and character is (generally speaking) greater in story games than "mainstream" games, which means players are much less "in" their characters and do not feel the suffocating constraints of their characters as keenly.  In fact, the more suffocating the character constraints, the more the player is "pushed" out to consider the situation from a more abstract viewpoint (ie, "Oh my god, look at my character squirm!").  I am by no means saying that the persistent doom of the setting cannot be replicated in a story game, but it will require, I think, some pretty non-standard techniques.<br/><br/>Ironically, one option may be to remove control of the doom from the hands of the GM and the players, and make the entire game an against-the-board sort of set up.  To be utterly crude, if there was a Doom Track and the actions of the PCs and NPCs in the games contributed tokens to the Doom Track or took them away and if there were biting consequences for the escalation of the Doom Track, that might get the players in the right headspace for the desperation of Tribe 8.  If the players can see the crumbling architecture right in front of them but not be able to see how to actually fix it... that sounds like Tribe 8 to me.  At that point, I don't know if a "correct answer" is even necessary, if you wanted to run a character-centric plotline that took place in that desperate setting without directly addressing that setting.<br/><br/>Anyway.

So there is none of that 'jump about like frogs until you find the right pot to land in' issue going on. <br/><br/>The game then follows a track between Doom and Salvation, using something like either the Apocalypse touchstones from Conspiracy of Shadows Apocalypse or the Humanity 0 = Doom of the Universe from Charnel Gods. Then you set up a way that characters can either spend Doom to win something, but that makes Doom go up, or they can sacrifice bonds and shit that they care about in order to move up the Salvation track. Sacrifice leads towards Salvation, but you have to tempt Doom sometimes too or you end up dead or without anything worth sacrificing. So the whole game becomes a tug of war between winning and saving. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Also, another thing that always struck me about Tribe 8 is the trade off between individualism and group identity. Almost all the powers of the game come from being part of a group, and the more part of the group you are the more power you have access too. But, at the same time, the setup of the game insists that the characters be individuals who will leave, overcome, or radically alter the very groups that give them power. There has to be something cool to be done with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60243/#Comment_60243" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T14:51:28+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  2:51PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am uncertain of your initial premise, Brand.

That isn't to say that it isn't a awesome facet of the setting, with vast potential to fuel excellent stories. However,of late I've been wary of 'save the world'-esque plots, as they've been par the course in my past experience.<br/><br/>That said, maybe there's a different way to fame the entire thing. A Story-Games version of T8 might benefit from the use of myth-arcs -- perhaps with slightly "focused" stats for each phase. <br/><br/>Something like...<br/><br/>I. <b>Fate of the Eighth Tribe</b>. (Are they able to work together or do they allow their differences to split them apart?)<br/>II. <b>The Z'bi Threat</b>. (Specifically H'lkar)<br/>III. <b>Fate of the Architecture</b>. (Are they able to keep it all from coming crumbling down?)<br/><br/>Now those who have access to the second edition (I don't), could probably come up with a more apt division, but I'll be honest, that first arc is where my most interest is. :P<br/><br/>Clinton's Face of Angels does something like this to frame the scope of the story, step by step. Maybe the rolls or resource allocation from previous Arcs (representing the choices the players have made) can have specific effects of the starting conditions of the proceeding ones. Burning Empires is a prime example of this type of system.<br/><br/>Brand,<br/><br/>You hit the nail on the head about what I was aiming at with the 'The necessity and interaction of Identity and Community' thing. I totally see the Fallen's situation akin to the series <b>Deadwood</b>. They're all in this god-forsaken situation, and pretty much their only hope is each other, but you've got all these different ideologies, egos and agendas colliding, and it isn't helping things. Plus on top of that you've got the demons, prophecy and spiritualism thing going on that makes it all that much more grave.<br/><br/>I like your Doom and Salvation thing. I just picked up Conspiracy of Shadows at OrcCon (I'll have to go back and read the GM section), but I don't have Charnel Gods. Could you give me a bit more insight on how Humanity works? How do the players affect Humanity? Is it a clock that just counts down, or is it something they can belay?<br/><br/>Thanks for your input guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60255/#Comment_60255" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T15:22:37+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  3:22PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2007 3:26PM by Vasco Brown.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [<b>edit</b>: moved to whisper]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60256/#Comment_60256" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T15:23:53+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  3:23PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2007 3:39PM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vasco, I couldn't agree more; I am incredibly tired of saving the world.  However, as a player, I would have a big fat problem playing in a Tribe 8 game where I was not able to address (even if only tangentially and ineffectually) the crumbling world.  Cause that world needs some serious saving.  The collapse of the great architecture is what drives the desperation of the rest of the setting.<br/><br/>That said, you could totally frame a game like Rebooted Battlestar Galactica, where the Z'bri and crumbling architecture are used as Cylons: outside facets that increase the pressure on the PCs as they attempt to address their own issues.  And actually, I would totally sign up for that game.  Once it's out on the table what the PCs can address and what they can't/won't, the game gets much more appealing.  Also, TSOY Keys would be <em>perfect</em> for that set up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60257/#Comment_60257" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T15:25:18+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  3:25PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            as i drove home i was thinking on this and most of what i was thinking are all artifacts.

Aspects are divided into two categories:<br/>* * Identity (Characteristics, Beliefs, Talents)<br/>* * Community (Relationships, Reputations, Resources)<br/><br/>* For each player, frame and play through a scene recounting a situation where their character met and either befriended or rivaled one of the other PCs, since their arrival on Hom.<br/><br/>* Additionally, for each player, frame and play through a scene recounting either a significant person or event that has left a marked impression their character, since they arrived on Hom. Note that down as a starting Aspect.<br/><br/>* In conflicts, roll an opposed 3d6 against your opponent. Each of your die that rolls higher than your opponents highest die is a Victory.<br/>* Points may be spent from a single relevant Aspect (up to it's permanent rating) to modify the roll.<br/>* * Indentity Aspects give bonus die, one for one.<br/>* * Community Aspects give a bonus to the result of your highest die, one for one.<br/><br/><b>Fullfilling or Averting Fate/Destiny/Prophecy</b><br/><br/>* The game progress through three Story-Arcs:<br/>** I. The Fate of the Fallen<br/>** II. The Fate of the Tribes/The Z'bri Threat<br/>** III. The Fate of the Architecture<br/><br/>* Doom and Salvation are scores that track the eventual collapse or restoration of the Architecture. It is modified by the players actions.<br/><br/>* As play progresses, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">players</span> will come up with Omens to mark the track towards the fullfillment of The Prophecy. These may be specific events, situations, or short, vauge and ambiguous viginettes. (Stolen from Keith's CoS: Apocalypse). Player's can gain Fate from either bringing these things to pass or averting them. Note must be taken of how Fate is spent, as it will determine whether Doom or Salvation is earned. In game, the Omens will be revealed to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">characters</span> one after the other, at dramatially appropriate moments. ("That damn Guide keeps showing up at the oddest times!")<br/><br/><b>Sacrifice</b><br/><br/>* Characters have a maximum of seven Aspects at any given time; four from character generation and three that may be earned during play. Once a character reaches seven Aspects, a new Aspect gained must replace an old one. Once an old Aspects has been replaced it can never be taken again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60391/#Comment_60391" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T14:51:33+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  2:51PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, for those interested here is a brief writeup of the structure of the Tribe 8 metaplot canon. I'm going to summarize and keep things as short as possible, but it will be long and full of spoilers and stuff. So...<br/><br/>SPOILERS. DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW <br/><br/>Right then, lets go.<br/><br/>Way back in the way back there was stuff. The dead and the living were separated from each other. People lived here, the dead lived on the other side of the fold. Shit went wrong. People in this world became alienated from the spiritual side of their lives and the worlds went father and farther apart. Life for humanity became spiritually void, and life for those on the other side became void of any material connection or physical sensation. Shit was getting bad wrong. So some missionaries and gurus from the other side came through to earth to try to teach humanity to return to balance. However things did not hold, humanity didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t learn and the things on the other side wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t wait. The Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, spirits of humanity who had lived in the other world for unknown years and ages, deprived of any physical sensation or input, void of many of the things that had once made them human, came flooding into the world after the teachers. The result was an orgy of blood and destruction that, combined with humanity\xe2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to fight the invasion, resulted in the end of the World Before. (Though there are plenty of signs that the World Before was on the way out anyway, global climatic change and nuclear disasters and the like.) <br/><br/>Humanity then fractures. Some of them run into the wilds and go neo-primitive, some of them hide in holes in the ground survivalist style and over generations turn technology into a fetish whose deeper workings they only party understand anymore, and a vast number of them are herded into camps by the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, where they live and die at the pleasure of the depraved overlords. Eventually the gurus, the wise spirits, that remained decided things had gone to far and something desperate had to be done. So they closed \xe2\u20ac\u0153the fold\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u201c the bridge between the world of flesh and the world of spirit, right down the middle of the world of dream. This stranded the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri in the physical world and made them vulnerable and dependant upon having access to bodies to inhabit. It also stranded the spirits of those who died in this world on this side of the fold, unable to go to the world of spirit beyond. This ritual killed the majority of the gurus (sometimes called Nomads) and their human disciples (those who survived would become the Guides). It is about this point that mysticism fractures. Those who follow the path of dream and spirit (the Fatimas, most humans who have magical powers) learn Synthesis. Those who follow the path of flesh and spirit (the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, some Mistresses) retain Sundering. Those who follow dreams of the ancient world (Keepers) gain Technosmithing. Those who remember, the Guides mostly, retain the Old Arts \xe2\u20ac\u201c which have the power of all the other forms of mysticism, but in balance with each other. <br/><br/>At the same time groups of leader-spirits came across (it isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t ever clear exactly when all these things happened in precise timing, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s got a mythic age quality). In order to avoid the traps of madness that had chained their Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri sisters to the flesh, these spirit emissaries from the Mother inhabited bodies of inanimate material and became the Fatimas. In so doing they avoided the fleshy-madness of the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, but lost the empathy of the flesh and became cold, inflexible, and self-righteous. They came to the camps in various places around the world, and lead the humans trapped there in revolt.  In Vimary (which was once Montreal) there was great success, but many other cities revolutions failed. And even in Vimary the presence of the Dread Lord T\xe2\u20ac\u2122bor made it unlikely that the humans had any chance of surviving the local war. And as the other wars failed around, the Fatimas realized they couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t win and needed to seek peace. <br/><br/>Joshua, the Ravager and only known male Fatima, would not stand for peace. It was victory or death, live free or die. So the other Fatimas betrayed him. They worked with the Baron, T\xe2\u20ac\u2122bors right hand man, to betray both T\xe2\u20ac\u2122bor and Joshua. Tera Sheba convinced Joan to help, and when she and the Baron turned their backs on T\xe2\u20ac\u2122bor and Joshua the two juggernauts killed each other. To seal the peace afterwards the Fatimas took T\xe2\u20ac\u2122bor\xe2\u20ac\u2122s heartstone and the Baron took Joshua\xe2\u20ac\u2122s. (A heartstone is the physical stone left behind when an individual of great spiritual power dies. It contains something of their essence and powers, and those who know how to wield them can turn that power to their own ends.) The humans of Vimary were allowed to take the southern islands as their own, and the rest of the land was left in the power of the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the rebellions in most other cities failed. We only ever find out about a few others. Rhanto (Toronto) has the camps ended, but with humanity in a constant guerilla war against the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri who still wield the power. In Capal (Quebec City) the revolution is crushed and only one of the Fatimas born there escapes \xe2\u20ac\u201c Mary, the Forgiver, who makes her way to Vimary just as the war is ending. In Hattan the war goes very differently, and the fatimas and Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri lords alike are overthrown by a group of Mistresses who use the heartstones and souls of Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, Fatimas, and humans alike to start a reign of blood and terror even more viscerally grotesque than that of the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri. In defeating the enemy they became the enemy, and started to build an empire through what is now New York and New Jersey. <br/><br/>Mary, in Vimary, found out about Joshua\xe2\u20ac\u2122s betrayal and the fact that humanity in Vimary had turned their faces from the Mother and only looked to the Fatimas. She could not forgive either Joan or humanity for their weakness and blindness, and so could not give them absolution. Feeing this failure deeply she contacted the Guides, old servants of the guru nomads who knew the Old Arts, the true secrets of mysticism, and decided to die and be reborn so that she could learn the lessons of mortality, weakness and struggle so that eventually she could learn to truly forgive. She died and Agnes was born. For their role in this the Guides were considered Fatima murderers and were ever after the mortal enemies of the Tribes, hunted and killed at any opportunity. <br/><br/>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s about here that we come into the starting age of Tribe 8 1st edition. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Humanity\xe2\u20ac\x9d in the eyes of the Tribes is the Tribes. They know that there are squats and Keepers about, but they are fallen and dejected beings. The power of the Fatimas and Synthesis and the protection of the Pact between Fatima and Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri (which humanity knows nothing about) has made the Tribes the rulers of their domain, richer, wealthier, more comfortable and more powerful than anyone else in their region. Joan is being devoured by her guilt, Agnes is a spoiled brat baby who shows no signs of growing up into what Mary wanted her to be, and Tera Sheba \xe2\u20ac\u201c who made the final call to betray Joshua \xe2\u20ac\u201c has become self-righteous and judgmental to shield herself from doubts about her own actions. The Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri still rule much of the world, but some Keeper and Squat groups have fought their own way free and are building their own cultures. The Tribes know little about these, however, for they live in self-imposed ignorance. The disposed who cannot fit into Tribal life become the Fallen. Then the MRB starts. <br/><br/>So that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the background information, in really rough and ugly form. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll get to the future metaplot in the next post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60392/#Comment_60392" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T15:07:41+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  3:07PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Children of Prophecy<br/><br/>In the first arc of the metaplot the Fallen are tested and tried and learn that they have a great destiny, but will have to pay for it with blood and sacrifice. This arc was fully published as Enemy of My Enemy, Children of Lilith, and Trial by Fire. In those books the PCs, and the other Fallen through them, learn that there are still members of Joshua\xe2\u20ac\u2122s tribe alive and well in the outlands. Seeking the prophecy of Joshua the PCs go into the outlands and end up finding Lilith, a fake Fatima built by Dahlia the Trickster to teach the Fallen a lesson. In the end, however, she becomes something like a real Fatima and is killed by Joan at the order of Tera Sheba. Doing so ruptures the relationship between Joan and Tera Sheba, however, leaving the two most influential Fatimas at odds. Then the Fates (Baba Yaga, Eva, Magdalin) take advantage of this to allow the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri to kidnap Agnes in a plot to force Agnes to start growing up. The Fallen take the blame for the abduction and face the full fury of the Tribes, and are hunted and burnt to the edge of life before the PCs lead a daring rescue to reclaim Agnes from the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri. As a result the Fallen are allowed to return to their lands and Agnes does begin to grow into the Fatima she must become. The Prophecy of Joshua also becomes public knowledge when Veruka the Wraith is executed at public trial and dies with the words on her lips. The attacks between Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri and Tribes also weaken the Pact, and both sides start to think of war. <br/><br/>Conquests<br/><br/>In the second cycle the Fallen become the Eighth Tribe and rise to lead the Nation in a great war against the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri. The Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri of the H\xe2\u20ac\u2122lkar and Capal are destroyed and cast out, and the Eighth Tribe begins to learn of the world beyond Vimary, making alliances with Keepers and several powerful Squat federations, including that of Luther Boarhead. This cycle was fully published as Warrior Unbound, Broken Pact, Vimary Burns, Revanche, and Liberation. <br/><br/>The main events in this cycle start with Joan searching for absolution for her crime of betraying her brother Joshua. With the help of the PCs she ventures deep into the River of Dream and returns triumphant after nearly being destroyed. She then sides with the Fallen, in direct defiance of Tera Sheba, shattering the image of Fatimal unity and changing the Fallen into the Eighth Tribe. After that Agnes too sides with the 8th, and starts leading raids deep into the heart of Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri lands. Soon the pact between Fatima and Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri shatters and wars rage across Vimary. The Tribes are nearly destroyed and have to seek shelter with the 8th, who end up leading the wars that destroy the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri in Vimary. With that done and a sense of power and destiny behind them the 8th then forms a coalition of Fallen, Keepers, Squats, Tribals, and former Serfs and marches to Capal and after several brutal wars ends up destroying the Prince of the Z\xe2\u20ac\x9dbri and freeing the Saint Lawrence Seaway of Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri once and for all. In so doing, however, so many die that the flood of souls into the blocked up River of Dream starts massive hauntings, rising of Zoms, and the general disintegration of the Great Architecture. In fighting to make things better some things do get better, but many get worse. <br/><br/>Capal, the last book published for 1st edition, happens right at the cusp between this cycle and the next. The 2nd edition players guide starts the next cycle, which I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll post about next. At this point we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re done with 2 of 5 cycles, and after this no new books have been published.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60399/#Comment_60399" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T15:33:33+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  3:33PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2007 3:43PM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Legacies <br/><br/>This unpublished cycle starts with the next generation taking over. The heroes and PCs of the first two cycles are assumed to retire or be dead, (which considering how Liberation ends is quite likely) and now their children and the children of their legacy must step up to fix the problems that their parents generation has left behind. Much of the cycle is dominated by the struggle of the youth of the nation to make the elders, now entrenched and established in their power, about the real and growing problems the Great Architecture faces. Zoms, ghosts, renegade Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri and spirits storms and falling plagues start to rip across the world, and result in war against Rhanto, more massacres, and witch hunts through the nation. <br/><br/>The young PCs must join forces with Agnes and the Guides (as the elder Guides go insane) in order to find the deeper causes of the spirit storms, stop the disaster of the war with Rhanto, and search out the deeper mysteries of the River of Dream. Then, just as progress is starting to be made, the Mistresses of Hattan come into direct contact with the Nation. The PCs get a chance to go to Hattan to see the depraved bloodsports and orgies, the towers of monstrosity that the Mistresses have built, things worse than the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri ever did \xe2\u20ac\u201c but also see that the Mistresses have rediscoverd the Old Arts, which the Nation has never been able to do. War starts between Hattan and the Nation, and the Eighth is left facing an enemy that looks like the end of the path they had felt themselves starting upon. <br/><br/>Spirit Dance <br/><br/>This cycle deals with the turn from violence and conflict on the outer stage towards themes of inner growth and healing, as humanity as a whole tries to learn to find a way to balance their desires with the needs of the world and each other. Much of the action of this cycle has to do with personal sacrifice not to conquer, but to learn. <br/><br/>As the Nation and the Hattani start what is the Tribe 8 equivalent of a World War, everything very suddenly goes to complete and utter shit. In the midst of this nightmare the PCs work with Agnes again, as she finally becomes an adult and moves into her own mature power. Together they find the remains of the last Nomads and learn the truth about the Fatimas, the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, the Guides and the Nomads. Agnes gains the ability to take a body of human flesh to learn of humanity and to repair the rift between humanity, z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, and Fatima with the help of the PCs. <br/><br/>When Agnes and the PCs return they are denounced as heretics by the leaders of the Nation, who will not turn their attention from the war with Hattan. A spirit storm of massive and horrible dimensions strikes the whole world. Legions of angry ghosts, dispossessed Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, nightmares and twisted things born from the crumbling of the world hit every side like a sledgehammer. The PCs are the only ones who can help the Nation survive, and only at great personal cost. Hattan is destroyed utterly, scourged to the ground, and Capal only survives as well as the PCs manage to protect it. The Fatimas and the Nation have to finally admit their failings, and join behind the PCs to look to heal the world. <br/><br/>Restoration<br/><br/>The final arc of the game focuses on healing the world and finding balance between all the different groups of humanity and para-humanity. The Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, Fatimas, Keepers, and Squats all act sometimes as allies and sometimes as enemies to the PCs, as they seek to unite all of humanity in all its forms to do the great work of fixing the Great Architecture. <br/><br/>The external world is in the worst state its ever been in. The Great Storm has left most of the world outside the enclaves as a wasteland full of walking dead and worse horrors. Brave souls go forth to bring back knowledge and artifacts of lost fatimas, the world before, and the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri.  The Gudies, Agnes, and the PCs work to stop further plagues and storms which continue to wrack the world. Eventually a rupture happens between Keepers and Dreamers, as each blames the other for the disbalance. Joan and Tera Sheba are killed in the following war, and the PCs and Agnes become desperate to find a solution. In the end the PCs must work with Agnes, recover the heartstones of the great fallen leaders both Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri, Fatimal, and other, and work with the Z\xe2\u20ac\u2122bri of Rhanoto to take a massive chance on an unknown ritual that could save the world or destroy it. With plagues and storms and self-apointed champions of the Goddess and the Seed seeking to destroy the PCs, they must lead the ritual joining all of humanity together and reopening the fold.  The fold opens, and the healing begins as much of the \xe2\u20ac\u0153pressure\xe2\u20ac\x9d of the River of Dreams drains away. The storms stop and a chance is left open for healing. The emergency is over, but generation of work will be needed to fix everything. Luckily the PCs that survived are treated as prophets and leaders and have a real chance to help humanity fix itself. <br/><br/>And that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s where the cycles end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60410/#Comment_60410" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T16:05:35+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  4:05PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a heap for that Brand.
