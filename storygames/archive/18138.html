And now I have questions.<br/><br/><b>Real world context</b><br/><br/>This was All Dad roleplaying at it's finest.  Me and two good friends whom I've been gaming with since early high school days.  Comparing notes, we'd all been up multiple times during the previous night putting our kids back to bed repeatedly.  By the time we'd eaten pizza with my wife and she and our baby had gone off to bed we had about two hours to game before alcohol caught up with us and everyone had to call it quits.<br/><br/>I mention this because this is the context I game in now:  Games have to show up and be Fun Right Now or they are useless to me.  I'd been getting all excited over the last couple of months about <i>World of Dungeons</i> because I thought it could deliver and about <i>The Planarch Codex</i> because as it's most interesting setting.  This was where the rubber and the road would meet.<br/><br/><b>Setup</b><br/><br/>Our play was divided into two parts of about an hour each.  In the first hour, we did setup for the game.<br/><br/>This part went pretty well.  I didn't have a good pitch for the game or why it would be fun and wasted some time fumbling around trying to explain the publishing history of *World games but when we got to the specific setting and character creation things clicked really naturally.<br/><br/>I told the players that they were each survivors of different worlds that had been subsumed by Dis who now made a living as freebooters within the city.  They came up with simple character concepts and we fleshed them out by asking each other leading questions until we arrived at the following PCs:<br/><br/><i>Prince Jaarkesh of Saben</i> hailed from a desert world gradually eaten alive by drought.  As resources dwindled, the tribes became more and more hostile to one another.  When Dis finally consumed Saben it was more of an evacuation than anything else, but Jaarkesh's tribe did not make it through in time and were left to starve in the desert.  The survivors now live in the Parish of Little Saben where the tribal structures have turned into gang structures and barter and infighting are as fierce as ever.  As a prince without a tribe, Jaarkesh would be a dead man there and so he lives in a slum in Ditchwater and works as a freebooter instead.  Oh!  And we established that the curse which devoured Saben, called The Arid, came with them:  The soil of Little Saben is dessicating and crumbling and one day an enormous sinkhole will consume the whole thing.  (Should I have written a Countdown then and there?)<br/><br/>Prince Jaarkesh<br/>STR 0  DEX +2  CON +1  INT +1  WIS +1  CHA +1<br/>Skills:  Athletics, Survival<br/>Special Abilities:  Skirmish, Reflexes<br/>Heritage Moves:  Run on Walls, Evoke Fortitude Fever, Barter with Thieves<br/>Equipment:  Leather armour, twin curved shortswords.<br/><br/><i>Myilli of the Th'Tharrl</i> came from a world of flesh-shapers, each caste warped by the Shapers to fit their role in society.  Myilli was of a caste of flyers -- somewhere between a feudal knight and a WWI fighter pilot.  But he was a third generation member of the nobility and took his position and its privileges for granted until Dis ate his world and him with it.  Dis does not have the light gravity of his home and so he cannot fly, only manage a kind of clumsy gliding. Here the caste system is inverted and the flyers and Shapers struggle to fit in and survive while the strong, sturdy Workers became dominant.<br/><br/>Myilli<br/>STR 0  DEX -1  CON +2  INT +1  WIS +1  CHA +1<br/>Skills:  Awareness, Leadership<br/>Special Abilities:  Scout, Volley<br/>Heritage Moves:  Glide like a hawk, Charm underling, Beat to high ground<br/>Equipment:  Medium crossbow<br/><br/>All this content came from the players with very little prompting from me other than asking, "What is that?  How come?"  (I think the only direct contribution I made was the idea that the curse that destroyed Saben should be active in Dis.<br/><br/>Next post:  Our freebootin' heroes' first mission.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409407/#Comment_409407" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T23:41:22+00:00" title="March 17, 2013 11:41PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wonderful Characters!

I think it was about 40 minutes each to come up with characters, talk through the first mission and then start play.  That makes this the middle section of this post.<br/><br/>Sorry my post rate is so slow, by the way.  Between kid juggling and brand new job (first day today) I don't have a lot of time to feed the gaming monkey.<br/><br/>Also:  Thanks for all the kind comments about the characters.  I totally agree.  I'm back gaming with my old, old, old school group here, guys who've been gaming together more or less continuously since some of us were 11 back in (ahem) 1986 and they never fail to bring really fizzing creativity to the table.  This was a place where the Dungeon World dictum to ask questions dovetailed very naturally with my normal style of GM'ing for this group and everything flowed basically effortlessly.<br/><br/><br/><b>First Mission</b><br/><br/>Rolling up our heroes' first mission was the first chance for us to see Dark Heart's random inspiration mechanics in action.  This was the part I was looking forward to and, in fact, it worked really well.<br/><br/>Before rolling for the mission I asked the players about their band of freebooters -- were they a two man partnership or the last survivors of a much larger outfit?  They thought for a minute and decided that they had until recently been a three man team but that on their last mission the third man -- a "heavy duty fighter type" -- had betrayed them and they had had to kill him.  With that in mind, we picked up the dice.<br/><br/>The text of Dark Heart calls for "the mission leader" to roll for its outcome.  I asked the players and they weren't really down with the idea that either one of them would be "the leader" per se, so I reframed it in terms of, which one of you made the contact that brought you this job?  They decided Jaarkash made the contact so I asked Myilli's player to roll up the mission.  He got<br/><br/>Patron:  A guild<br/>Target:  A diplomat<br/>Type:  Raid<br/>Location:  A nearby parish<br/><br/>Some back and forth yielded the following:  The team were hired by a guild of moneylenders -- Glimmer Dwarves, akin to earth elementals in the manner of Gloranthan Mostali -- to collect on one of their delinquent clients.  Officially, the moneylenders are respectable but people who don't pay up on time keep having mysterious "accidents" and everyone knows the reason why.  The target in question was the Artexa of Tylesh, an extra-planar diplomat about whom we mostly established color:  She exists in a milieu similar to the diva Plavalaguna in the 5th element, surrounded by underlings ("gas-mask guys", someone said) with whom she is in perpetual psychic contact.  To communicate with the inhabitants of Dis she uses a translator -- a small reptilian goblinoid with a proboscid trunk which wraps around one arm and performs translation as a psychic function.  Depriving the diplomat of her means of communication until such time as she makes good appeals to the moneylenders' sense of irony.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the third man (as yet unnamed) chose to contact the Artexa directly and see if she would make him a better offer to sabotage the mission.  She must have done so for he turned on his accomplices.  At this point Jaarkash's player rolled and the net result was a bloody showdown and our heroes fleeing the Artexa's compound leaving his corpse behind but with the translator in tow.<br/><br/>At this point, I was extremely happy with all the prep we'd done:  I thought we had great characters and seeds for a lot of interesting long-term content that could simmer in the background while missions played out.  Now all I had to do was start actual, y'know, play and start tapping all that potential.<br/><br/>Which was where I ran into the fact that I don't really understand how to run World of Dungeons.  But more on that tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409520/#Comment_409520" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T18:05:34+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  6:05PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome so far.

So we had set up characters and generated some immediate Situation for them to be embedded in.  We were all ready to jump into actual play.  (Although really I consider all of the above to be "play" too, just of a different kind.  It was certainly a lot of fun to get to this point.)<br/><br/>By this time we were bearing down on 11 and alcohol + general exhaustion were catching up with us.  I decided to make some simplifying decisions:<br/><br/>1) I jettisoned all the material from the Ill-Met In Ditchwater section about the PCs' living situation and the Fleshtakers.  I felt that the Glimmer Dwarves would provide enough immediate threat in their role as a demanding employer.<br/><br/>2) I started play with the PCs meeting with their contact and receiving payment for the backstory gig (with the Artexa).  That way they could roll their reward money in with their starting coins and then buy equipment.  <br/><br/>3) I decided to have the players roll up only one new job and have their contact with the moneylenders present it to them so as to get them moving in the direction of action more quickly.<br/><br/>This last decision bit me:  The job we rolled up was <br/><br/>Patron:  The Glimmer Dwarven Moneylenders<br/>Target:  A pilgrim<br/>Type:  Assassination<br/>Location:  A nearby parish<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this hit not one but two minor discomfort triggers for me:  I'm not super cool with games where the PCs perform indisputably evil acts like for-pay assassination.  And I am sensitive about treatment of religion and religious characters in fiction and dislike seeing them reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes and/or treated as punching bags.  I knew right when I looked up the tables that I was not going to be okay with a setup where the PCs whacked William of Baskerville for 30 silver pieces.  I knew the light, jokey tone we had established for the evening would not accommodate a segue into the moral examination of the rights and wrongs of such a situation.  And I was worried that tension between the players' desire to have a good time and my desire not to be uncomfortable would derail the rest of the evening.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I should've just declared my discomfort and asked for a do-over.  But instead I decreed that we should ensure that the mark was someone who had it coming.  I therefore created Graarsht the Unwell, an anti-paladin of the Plague God Yari.  He was a massive man-mountain humanoid with reptilian features and obsidian piercings through his eyebrows, nose, lips and ears.  Apparently, Yari sends his disciples out into the Many Planes on five year quests to gather new and terrible diseases before they return to his temple in Dis to receive his benediction once again.<br/><br/>Rolling up this job was embedded in roleplaying the scene where the PCs met their contact from the Glimmer Dwarves ("Mr Flint").  I asked the players where they met him -- in a public place?  Or something more unusual, like maybe in back of a pub that had a fantasy equivalent of cockfighting?  The players both looked at one another and burst out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocobo_Racing" rel="nofollow">"Chocobo races!"</a>  This reference was lost on me but they quickly explained and we rolled with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens" title="Robert Ahrens"><img alt="Robert Ahrens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/664/n4GHDX832T7IU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens">Robert Ahrens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409642/#Comment_409642" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T17:57:16+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  5:57PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2013 5:57PM by Robert Ahrens.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We decided that these races were at the high end of the spectrum, more Roman coliseum than back-alley cockfight.  Rare and beautiful Chocobo with exotic plumage and ornate pedigrees ran in them and significant amounts of money changed hands.  Mr Flint reserved a private booth and used it to do a little business between races.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I failed to find a decent voice for Mr Flint.  I found myself wanting to give him a Bob Hoskins type dodgy geezer personality and simultaneously thinking that would be really crass and unoriginal.  I held back and he ended up with no personality at all -- just a generic Mr Johnson type like we've all yawned at in 100 different shadowruns.  I also failed to live up to the Principle of Revealing Greater Diversity:  Nothing distinguished him from the society from which he came or the faction he represented.<br/><br/>I then had my first moment of rules confusion:  Prince Jaarkash tried to rap Flint that there had been added danger and they deserved additional compensation.  I found myself torn between my standard "indie instinct" to go to the dice as soon as uncertainty enters play and the feeling that that was a really long stretch because the additional danger stemmed directly from the fact that the PCs' group had turned out to be unreliable (ie. one of their members was a traitor who nearly blew the mission).  I vaguely recalled some text from Dungeon World about how you can't just say you attack the giant if you can't explain how you put yourself in position to actually deliver an effective blow and decided by analogy that this argument was too weak to merit a roll. <br/><br/>Some GM's instinct told me that the Artexa's translator could be a source of some fun conflict and tension downstream.  I had Flint tell them that the Moneylenders were not pleased:  They had been sent to teach the Artexa a lesson and leave no trail.  Instead, they had trashed her place and left the corpse of their former associate in her courtyard.  "You have become high risk", Flint told them.  "We intend to manage that risk aggressively."  He paid them for the job they had done but insisted that they retain the translator but keep it safe until it needed to be returned to the Artexa.<br/><br/>Jaarkash took this opportunity to redouble his efforts at increasing their compensation.  There was a bit more roleplay behind it and I allowed the player a roll but the end result was a failure.  I had Flint present the Graarsht mission and send them on their way.  He told them that if they wanted more money there was a more lucrative and more dangerous mission that they could take on for the money-lenders.  He explained who Graarsht was and that there was personal discord between him and high-ranking members of the money-lenders.  (Is it plausible that he would've told them that?  Probably not, but he did.)  He stressed that no-one was going to miss Graarsht and told them that he would be visiting the temple of Yari in three days time. <br/><br/>We rolled up the job at this time (see above) and ended with me asking what the nearby parish might be.  The players suggested that it was "where the temples are" and I came up with the parish of Temple Mount, a ziggurat-like hill mosaiced with temples to every creed and faith.  I'm not sure I <i>like</i> this choice -- it's a bit too Discworld -- but it was made in the heat of the moment and now it's part of our Dis so there you go.<br/><br/>The PCs set to spending their money, buying equipment, and thinking about how to get within striking distance of Graarsht.  They decided they needed a distraction and that the simplest expedient would be to identify a rival faith -- basically any one that emphasized healing and was not tolerant of dissenting views -- and rabble rouse them into causing some kind of a scene while they got in position to send Graarsht to his happy hunting grounds.  Myilli made a roll (+ CHA for asking around, but in retrospect it should really have been + INT for knowledge since it all happened off-camera) and determined that he knew of just such a cult.<br/><br/>At this point, my grasp on where the game was going completely jumped the rails.  I started jotting stats for Temple Mount as a dungeon on a 3 x 5 index card.  I was using the dungeons-as-monsters rules from Dark Heart, but when I came to write the dangers I realized that I didn't know if the dangers should be general to the "dungeon" of Temple Mount or specific to the challenges that I expected the PCs to face there on this particular visit.  Moreover, I intended to treat the Temple of Yari as a separate dungeon <i>within</i> Temple Mount.  Did it make sense to "nest" one dungeon inside another?<br/><br/>Worse still, I could see the game rapidly slipping from a "dungeon quest" narrative to a "caper" style narrative as lots of rolls to hoodwink various factions would come into play.  Should I just call for a diceroll for causing the opposing religion to riot?  Or should that be structured as a whole side quest -- possibly involving and entire "dungeon" of its own?  What was the scope of impact of a roll, anyway?  Should I be trying to use the Agenda and Principles from Dungeon World (which I was basically ignoring) or should I just be running things in my own house style?  What <i>was</i> World of Dungeons anyway?  A dice mechanic?  A style of play?  A liter approach to Dungeon World?  An alternate resolution system for a "lost generation" of old-school play that I had never experienced?<br/><br/>On such philosophical questions, I choked up completely.  Fortunately, I was saved by the bell as midnight was fast approaching and Myilli's player had to go home and walk his dog.<br/><br/>All in all, the session was not a disaster.  But after such a promising start and so much great Situation generation I felt that the play component fell flat and that I was not well positioned to deliver clean cut and fun scene framing or challenges for the PCs.  I want to remedy that before the next time we tackle World of Dungeons.<br/><br/>Next post:  Some specific questions.<br/><br/>Also:  This is why I rarely post Actual Plays.  I think I spent longer typing up this one post than the entire session which I'm describing here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409692/#Comment_409692" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T08:46:56+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  8:46AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great post, Robert.

If you don't want them to assassinate some innocent pilgrims, don't give them that job! (They may do it anyway, but that's kinda on them and on the group setting an overall tone for play). Assassinating some scumbag is a totally reasonable call, though the Planarch guidelines will inevitably make the dude more complicated than just "some scumbag cultist." I generally always roll up 2-3 jobs, though, to give the players a real meaningful choice, but it seems like you noticed that in retrospect too.<br/><br/>Also, playing tired and drunk is tough, especially in games that require a lot of GM creativity. I generally run Planarch games in 2-3 hours because otherwise my brain just gets exhausted. There's no problem, generally, with making off-the-cuff calls that aren't ideal, because you'll get the chance to complicate them later. Your temple district sounds cool, actually. Why is it there? Are all the priests and cults limited to operating with a specific district? Is that where Dis comes closest to the celestial and infernal planes? Maybe the district used to be a plane full of temples? So many interesting choices there that don't end up at Pratchett.<br/><br/>One last initial comment: when I run Planarch, it often ends up being something other than a dungeon crawl, more like a urban fantasy or caper-based campaign like Warhammer Fantasy or Shadowrun. That's okay too! Also, if the dungeon-as-monster rules aren't working for you, feel free to jettison them. All the stuff in Planarch is optional and not everything will work for everyone. You can definitely run the game just calling for rolls based on the fiction, but you do have to have a firm grasp of the fiction and when a roll is appropriate, and it sounds like that broke down quickly for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409744/#Comment_409744" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T11:23:15+00:00" title="March 20, 2013 11:23AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally,<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17813/world-of-dungeonsshadows-why-i-can039t-go-back" rel="nofollow"> I found the World of Dungeons rules actually worked best in a "caper" style format</a> like you might experience in Shadowrun missions.

Their characters were essentially a diverse group of half-breeds from vastly different planes.<br/><br/>The adults generated a pair of whacked out misfits who paired up on a fugitive run through the city, fleeing from mysterious hunters from one character's home plane.

The other character was a misshapen Hellboy-type half-demon caught in deadly rivalry with his beautiful but hellishly evil twin.

Second attempt.  Thanks for your patience.<br/><br/>Having had a week to think about it now, I think my questions fall into two broad categories:  Some big picture stuff about how the game runs and some tactical questions about specific rules.  It's the big picture stuff that's important so that's what's in this post.<br/><br/>Here's the core of it:  <b>Whose GM'ing style do I use to run World of Dungeons?</b><br/><br/>Let me unpack that a bit:  About 10 years ago I read a quote on RPG.net by SteveD saying (and I paraphrase), "I basically run all games with the same rules-lite-ness".  At the time, I thought that that was the state of the art:  To have achieved such a mastery and understanding of your group's play-style and needs that you could bend and blend all of the broken, warped RPG texts out there to achieve your desired results regardless of what mechanical bear-traps they contained.  And, in fact, I realized this was the way I ran all games from high school onward, striving to remake them to fit the template in my head.<br/><br/>A couple of years after reading that quote I picked up Shadow of Yesterday, reread Sorcerer for the umpteenth time and a little cartoon lightbulb went on above my head.  I (felt like I) finally <i>got</i> indie games and particularly this concept of "system matters".  And I realized that in order to be happy and to revivify my gaming pleasure I would have to take the notion of the expert GM whose force of will bends all systems into the same template and kill it with my sword.<br/><br/>As a defense against my natural instinct to drift games I have since become pretty willing to second guess myself about what games are saying and try to understand the style they are intended to run in.  And most indie games make this really easy:  For instance, it's clear that Apocalypse World works overtime to help you run the game in Vincent Baker's style.  (Well, a style he developed.)  Dungeon World lets you run a game in the style Sage and Adam developed playing Apocalypse World and, in turn, World of Dungeons ... proves problematic:<br/><br/>World of Dungeons is full of blanks.  Am I supposed to fill those blanks with ...\n<ul>\n<li>procedures from Dungeon World?</li>\n<li>what I presume to be John Harper's house style?</li>\n<li>"old school" procedures that I would've learned in 1978 if only my intro to roleplaying hadn't been Tunnels &amp; Trolls circa 1985 and I assiduously avoided D&amp;D till 3rd edition came out?</li>\n<li>my own natural style of GM'ing?</li>\n</ul>\nForgive me if this seems like a remedial question, but I think my confusion on this point is at the root of the other questions I've asked:  If I can just run this game using my general GM'ing instincts then <i>of course</i> I know how to drift it from dungeon-delving style to Shadowrun-caper style or urban-fantasy style or what have you.  But I think I may have psyched myself out from trusting these instincts by thinking too much about Agendas and Principles and like that.<br/><br/>So ... uh ... yeah.  It seems pretty stupid when I put it like this.  But I am aware that this is an answer on a spectrum not just a boolean.  How much should I be "just GM'ing" and how much should I be looking to a specific discipline to shape my game?  Are there any gotchas?  Are there any play procedures which are known <i>not</i> to work or which you consider anti-patterns for WoDu/Planarch?<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410426/#Comment_410426" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T17:47:06+00:00" title="March 25, 2013  5:47PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2013 5:50PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert, I hesitated to respond here because I don't want to be seen as the "defensive designer" trying to stick up for their game. So I won't stick up for the game. In fact, I'll say the opposite: there was literally nothing in WoDu that could have helped you.<br/><br/>But, "getting on the right page" for successful RPG play is kind of a passion of mine, so I feel compelled to say more -- not as the designer, but as a passionate fellow gamer.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>World of Dungeons is obviously a companion piece to Dungeon World, right? It was created and released for that express purpose alone.<br/><br/>Nothing in those paltry few pages tells you how to play, but you got all the way to actual play at the table and expected it to tell you how to play? Where were those instructions supposed to suddenly spring from? They're simply not there. The thing is only 3 pages long.<br/><br/>I'm so confused! I mean, if the instructions aren't there, and you don't already know how to do it, and you don't recognize the play style it's suggesting, and you don't utilize the <b>400 page manual</b> with which the game was released, and you're second-guessing your GM skills, then for sweet heaven's sake, it's not going to go well.<br/><br/>It's like you tried to play <i>Sorcerer</i> using only a one-sheet and character sheet, and have never read any of the inspirational material.<br/><br/>I don't understand the question here.

Also, reading comprehension.<br/><br/>Firstly:  I don't think you're being defensive.  I am a huge fan of Agon and Lady Blackbird and definitely excited about World of Dungeons.  I know that the issues I'm having are in me, not the texts and if I've implied otherwise then I apologize for the affront.<br/><br/>Secondly:  I do think this is maybe a little harsh:\n<blockquote>I'm so confused! I mean, if the instructions aren't there, and you don't already know how to do it, and you don't recognize the play style it's suggesting, and you don't utilize the 400 page manual with which the game was released, and you're second-guessing your GM skills, then for sweet heaven's sake, it's not going to go well.<br/><br/>It's like you tried to play Sorcerer using only a one-sheet and character sheet, and have never read any of the inspirational material.</blockquote>\nTo be clear:  I have read Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, World of Dungeons, the Dungeon World Guide and the Planarch Codex.  And I've read quite a bit of what I take to be the source material for Planarch Codex, including Zelazny's Amber, Moorcock's Tale of the Eternal Champions and Calvino's Invisible Cities.  I've played Everway, Amber DRPG and a little bit of Planescape.  So I'm not coming at this thing completely cold.<br/><br/>I don't think my problem is that I haven't done the homework so much as that <i>by my reading</i>, it seemed that the play procedures for Apocalypse World, Dungeon World and Planarch were pointing me in different directions as to how to structure/handle the "mission" style play for Planarch Codex.  In play, I found my instincts urging me to go down one path but that path seemed a bit contradictory to the style of play outlined in Dungeon World.<br/><br/>It's clear to me that when you wrote WoDu you threw out a bunch of stuff from Dungeon World -- moves, alignment, etc.  But it also seems like you stripped down the GMs Moves and that machinery to make room for your own GM'ing style.  Certainly <i>my reading</i> of AP reports I've seen of people playing WoDu seem like folks are playing it a bit differently from Dungeon World in some ways.  Am I wrong about this?<br/><br/>My confusion is that I don't know if there's <i>some other specific way</i> I should be thinking about running WoDu or if I can just go ahead and follow my own instincts about structuring "caper" play.  <br/><br/>Honestly, all I'm looking for here is, "Yes, follow your instincts.

When I don't know what to do, or if a player rolls a 6- (or sometimes even a 7-9) and I can't think of a great option, I look down and draw inspiration from them. I also use the death move from DW, which I thought was called Death's Door but (as I found out this weekend) is actually called something else (Last Breath?). This is useful because characters in WoDu are pretty flimsy at first level.<br/><br/>All of the sandbox-y stuff from DW totally applies. As the booklet says, all of the Agendas and Principles and Moves remain the same except for a few that are tweaked and some new additions.<br/><br/>That said, you still have to really bring it as a GM, using the skills and techniques from your toolbox. It is a sandbox game and doesn't require any pre-planning, but even if you're mostly following the lead of the players, you have to flesh out the world and make it weird and unexpected, ask them provocative questions, and all of that stuff.<br/><br/>Note that this is just how JONATHAN runs the PLANARCH CODEX with WoDu, and may not apply to all WoDu play or how you run Planarch. I am happy to offer you advice, but in the end you're the one running the game. I would encourage you to not question your own GM instincts and the desires of the group unless you come across actual problems in play. Do what works and what seems fun to you. As John says, none of the brief materials in WoDu or Planarch really provide you with a crucible for you to polish your general GM craft against (Planarch does provide a crucible for doing multicultural fantasy, but that's different). You either have to bring the GM craft yourself or borrow the crucible from DW and work on it.<br/><br/>So, in short: be confident, bring your A-game, and -- when it doubt -- look to DW for more explicit instructions. Yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410508/#Comment_410508" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T19:13:18+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  7:13PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for starting this thread, Robert.

Instead I do something else. For Planarch, I replicate something like Fronts by using the jobs + "what happens when you don't take a job" move. To start, I roll up several possible jobs while the players are finishing up their characters (like buying gear or whatnot), have them pick the job they just finished (rolling to see how it went, as in the "love letter"), and then pick the job they've just decided to take on. Then we play that out as a single session. Next session, right before play begins (perhaps while they're spending their loot from last session), I roll to find out what's up with the job they didn't take, which increments the background fiction and makes the world around them have a life of it's own. Then I roll up a couple new jobs and add them to the board. Eventually, you'll then end up with multiple jobs out there that the players are not actively engaging with, which grow and develop or get replaced by other jobs. This becomes the "metaplot" of Dis, humming and churning along, but there for the players to actively engage with whenever they want, just by them taking up one of the available jobs.<br/><br/>If you're confused about the "dungeons as monsters" method of mapping and exploring various locations, I'm working on an example of play based on the one-shot I just ran at Gamestorm, a journey into the bowels of the lesser hell of Miasmog. I really dig that method, but it's totally optional and may or may not fit your local play style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410573/#Comment_410573" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T10:03:07+00:00" title="March 27, 2013 10:03AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2013 10:03AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat idea J!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410615/#Comment_410615" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T16:11:10+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  4:11PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            J's Planarch 'metaplot' mechanic is effing brilliant and sorta works like a focused 'choose your own adventure' sandbox.

I have a specific example I'm going to drill down into in my next post that will help establish if I'm really getting it or not.  <br/><br/>I definitely am loving the randomly generated jobs.  They fit incredibly well with the deliberate-whitespace strategies from Dungeon World (one of the things that I'm pretty sure I <i>do</i> get and which works really well for my group here and our play style).  I'm looking forward to watching them progress through their lifecycle and figuring out what that means for the overall story.<br/><br/>Judd, thanks.  I think a good summary one-sheet will definitely help.  One of the things I did wrong last time was to have way too many play aids:  Print-outs of what I thought were relevant pages from Dark Heart, GM's moves from Dungeon World, the move outcomes stuff from Streets of Marienburg, I had more than a dozen sheets and consequently didn't use any of them.  I really need to make myself a one-pager that captures the GM moves, agenda and principles that I intend to use and just go from that.<br/><br/>And thanks also to other people who've posted positive and useful things in this thread.  I am reading everything and mulling it over.<br/><br/>I have one more, specific question to ask about pacing and how "story" and "sandbox" fit together but, once again, it's somehow gotten late so that will have to wait till tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410623/#Comment_410623" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T17:04:53+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  5:04PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

I came up with three dangers, semi-randomly, and it all worked really well.<br/><br/>Madness: dominate choices XXXX<br/>Sewers: befoul and disgorge XXX<br/>Cliff: endanger OOXXX<br/><br/>One of the PCs has a flying surveillance drone "Bessy" that got badly hit by heavy-calibre rounds fired from a holy avenger's high powered sniper rifle. So Bessy ended up crash landing in a warehouse leaking radioactive fuel. <br/><br/>I started tonight's session with a couple of PCs scoping out the warehouse that stank of shit. Grey parkoured his arse to a second storey window (Cliff +1, Sewer +1).<br/><br/>Grey found himself on a walkaway above a huge pit dug out the length of the warehouse, 4 or 5 metres below street level, with broken pipes and filled with effluent and seething with worms.  He also spotted Block-Rockers working down there with sledgehammers, in the shit  (Madness +1, Sewer +1, Cliff +1). <br/><br/>Climbing a rope to the third floor, Grey crossed a room full of drugged, sick or exhausted people and has interesting conversation with a Mind-Blower, who was smoking a peace pipe, about his mission to find the alien space craft (Madness +2). O yeah, he got a bucket of live worms in case he got the munchies.<br/><br/>Then Grey climbed the stairs into a room full of tall vats of sugar. He found Bessy wedged in the rafters and a bunch of kids dead beneath, blue faced on her leaking radioactive fuel (Madness +1, Cliff +1).<br/><br/>Then Grey rolls snake eyes trying to get Bessy down and out of the building, the fire being she'd roll free and land in the pit, deep in shit.<br/><br/>The sugar came in handy for dropping bags at height on Bessy's owner when he came in, gunning down Block-Rockers and bossing people round. The proceeding battle got dangerous enough that both PCs backed off and regrouped. <br/><br/>Overall, Monsters as Dangers worked, the Dangers and rolling inspired me and the "dungeon" hung together well.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
