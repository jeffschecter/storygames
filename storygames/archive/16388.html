But until that snowball gets a-rollin', I have some questions:<br/><br/>1) When selling your own games - RPGs, card games, what have you - as an indie designer, are you required to get a license to become a company to do so? "My name is Ryan, but before I can sell anything, I need to apply to the state to officially recognize my company, Cool Dude Games, as a thing, before I can sell stuff under that banner."  <br/><br/>2) How do taxes work for you? Do you not count your game profits at all? What can you deduct, such as material costs, travel expenses to and from cons, and advertising?<br/><br/>3) Where do you get your stuff printed? Any cool local places near you? What arrangements and discounts have you made? What tricks have you learned?<br/><br/>4) For those of you who have successfully used Kickstarter to fund things, are you happy you did? Did it impact your taxes at all? What do you wish you had done differently?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374342/#Comment_374342" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T12:27:41+00:00" title="April 25, 2012 12:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2012 12:28PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my own XP:<br/><br/>1) Yup. Typically you need at least a state business license and may need a local (municipal) one as well.  For example, to sell stuff here, I'd have to have a Seattle business license. In all honesty, some of the best people to talk to about this are your bankers. Walk in, tell them you want to set up a small business account, and then start asking questions about what else you need to do.  If they're good, they'll put you on the right track.<br/><br/>2) I last did this a while ago, but doing taxes for your small business can be rough. Luckily, it's easier if you run all your expenses and income through a seperate business bank account. As I recall, most things related to your game can be deducted as costs, including going to conventions and buying other games for "research," but it might be worth your money to hire a tax professional to help you out, especially if you end up making significant income.<br/><br/>3) Cool local printers are great if you can find one and develop a good relationship.  Vincent does all his printing locally, for example.  Most other folks shop around and compare quotes on the internet, traditionally, or get word-of-mouth recommendations from other indie game publishers.  I know several awesome local places but they may not be right for you. There are so many tricks involved in printing; that's a whole thread in and of itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374344/#Comment_374344" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T12:51:39+00:00" title="April 25, 2012 12:51PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can run yourself as a personal business (not as a company) without filing a thing. Then when you do your taxes you fill out Schedule C (profit or loss from business). Schedule C is basically a subtraction of allowed business expenses from revenues to determine how much of your business income is taxable profit. Or you can run your business as a hobby and declare hobby income instead of doing Schedule C. The downside is that hobby income expenses aren't subtracted from your hobby revenues. They're combined with all your other tax deductions. So you have to itemize your deductions to get credit for them. And your hobby income is combined with your job income. So if your expenses are small they may not exceed the standard deduction and you end up paying taxes on your whole hobby income, rather than a subset of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots" title="amazingrobots"><img alt="amazingrobots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots">amazingrobots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374359/#Comment_374359" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T13:48:51+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  1:48PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, so I can just file as normal, but add the Schedule C form?

That is usually a separate filing from your state income tax.  Its basically the sales tax you're supposed to be collecting when you sell stuff...but even if you don't collect it...you gotta pay the state what you should have collected.  Some states let you get away with not paying sales tax for out of state internet sales, but more and more states want paid for them too.  Failure to pay those results in getting your license to do business revoked when they catch up to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374411/#Comment_374411" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T21:01:39+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  9:01PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to provide some insight from an Australian business perspective, where I'm a registered "sole-trader publishing entity"...but based on what I've been reading above, this perspective might just throw complications and confusion into the mix.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots" title="amazingrobots"><img alt="amazingrobots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots">amazingrobots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374417/#Comment_374417" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T21:41:11+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  9:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does anyone use an accountant for their business matters, or has this all been simple enough to tackle on your own?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374459/#Comment_374459" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T05:49:06+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  5:49AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We do at Bully Pulpit, and it has been an educational experience, but I wouldn't say it's essential.

Depends on the state. If you're a sole-proprietor in MN, you can just do a DBA (Doing Business As). You don't need a specific license to be an indie publisher. But, you should check with your state and local government. Sometimes, it's a PITA. For example, one of the local governments here requires a license that requires a full background check if you're not a property owner and you want to rent a place in town to open a business that sells something. If you set up an LLC, which is probably overkill unless you think you're going to get big (then do it at the start), you'll need to jump through a couple more hoops. Setting up a bank account also requires additional paperwork if you haven't done one since 9/11, so if you set up an LLC make sure you have everything that's required.<br/><br/>2. A great online accounting program that automatically pulls in PayPal: <a href="http://outright.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://outright.com/</a>. You need to claim all your income, but you can deduct all your expenses including mileage on your car (or actual expenses but mileage is much easier) and food. You also need to track starting and ending inventories, etc... If you just do POD with LULU, then it's easier because you have no inventory. Accounting isn't all that hard and something like Outright can get you prepared for tax time. If you're making a ton of money, you also need to pay estimated quarterly taxes or face a penalty. I screwed up last year and owed $2000+ in under payment. I paid a penalty. It sucked.<br/><br/>4. I haven't done a Kickstarter yet, but I've had three friends fund expeditions or aspects of expeditions with Kickstarter.
