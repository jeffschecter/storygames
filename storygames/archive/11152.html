As in, they do the groundbreaking, start putting up buildings, etc?<br/><br/>I am in the throes of making a <i>Dwarf Fortress</i> story game, so my source material involves a great deal of this kind of thing. It's possible that the Fortress and all the embedded conflicts it's going to have could be decided upon in a lightly structured, pre-play manner, akin to another form of character creation, and that makes me want to check out <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> for its town creation rules. I have a copy of <i>Storming </i>too, but I'm trying to make more of a collaborative story-game, rather than something focused on kicking butt and beating challenges. <br/><br/>Any ideas? <br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247708/#Comment_247708" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-20T23:28:10+00:00" title="December 20, 2009 11:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have an answer to your question, but I'm throwing my goodwill behind you to say: I want to see that game!

I'm going for more of a Story Now thing, with an example <a href="http://abbysgamerbasement.blogspot.com/2009/12/finally-progress-on-dwarf-fortress-rpg.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, so I'm asking in particular about what kinds of stories you see lurking in the source material, what kinds of stories you think are already there, on the surface of play ("You have broken into a peculiar chamber through the base of the mountain...", f'rex ^_^), and what you would want to *do* if you were playing this game, as you imagine it!<br/><br/>Thanks <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>[edited for reading a little more in the file] Oh, wow - I might steal this Seasons of the Covenant thing wholesale and jam it into a scene economy. I mean, this is pretty much what happens to a Fortress over time, and the accumulation of Fortress Points (something I'm tinkering with) increases the likelihood of encountering immigrants, merchants, and goblin invasions. Neat! [yet more reading] OK, so they didn't seem to actually write mechanics for the transition between Seasons, although the idea of a Winter Covenant finding a way to make it into the "next" Spring of its existence is pretty cool, and more than a little Arthurian ("the land and the king are one", and all that).<br/>[one last edit] Those of you familiar with the game may have already heard of Boatmurdered, a turn-based collaborative play of a Fortress someone made. The AP notes have been dramatized and posted <a href="http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/Boatmurdered/intro.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Even if you haven't played the computer game, this will give you an idea of what happens in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
