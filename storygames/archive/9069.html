Alas, I've gotten pretty good at handling pacing with my own group just through constant chatter, so I haven't seen the dial make a big difference.  I have seen it make a <i>small</i> positive difference, though.<br><br>The very first session where I brought it out, one player went Bullet Time on a sprint to splash an orc with acid before the orc could react to his approach and gore him.  This nicely got us on the same page for a back-and-forth narration:<br>Dan: "I crouch down, every muscle tense, ready to push off from the cave wall!"<br>Dave: "A droplet of water falls from the ceiling.  It's traveling... traveling..."<br>Dan: "I push off, sprinter-style, foot crashing into the puddle!"<br>Dave: "A huge splash goes up!  The falling droplet strikes your cheek!  The orc's shoulders twitch and it looks like he might be beginning to turn..."<br><br>The following session, Dan got bored during a "conversation with townsfolk" scene and slammed the marker on Scene Summary: Facts Only.  There was a moment of discord, as another player (John) said, "No, wait, it's important what we learn here."  Dan responded, "Then let's just establish what we learned!"  Which sounded like a problem at first, but we eventually realized that it wasn't one.  I just asked John what he hoped to learn, broke that into "what you'll definitely learn", "what you definitely won't learn", and "what you might learn", rolled a die for the latter, and voila.<br><br/>For a real player disagreement to arise re: the Speed &amp; Focus dial, it would have to be not about "what happens?" but rather about "what does that look like?"  It hasn't come up yet in my group.  If it does, I plan to handle it the same as any other social disagreement.  This is all metagame-level stuff, so direct person-to-person talk works fine.<br/><br/>One observation: the dial is much more relevant in a play environment which allows for some slowness (for me, often immersing in the sense of a place).  If you're trying to do as much fictional stuff as possible in your limited play window, your group will probably default to the fastest speed and least detail the group deems permissible for any given chunk of play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200559/#Comment_200559" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T00:53:18+00:00" title="April  4, 2009 12:53AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>your group will probably default to the fastest speed and least detail the group deems permissible for any given chunk of play.</blockquote>\nThat could still be highly variable - my group is like this but looooves conversations.

Sometimes it's quite functional and seamless, and having to worry about the dial would be a waste of energy.  I'm very clear when I introduce this to folks: you should never ever use the dial simply to "track" what you're already doing.  A reminder, and a new way to make requests (for anyone who might like to try that) -- that's all it is.  The codifying is just my attempt to include all the requests a player might make re: pacing and detail.<br/><br/>Re: usage:<br/>One thing I've considered doing is forcing players to use the dial during a quick pre-play demo or something, just so they can get comfortable with it and add it to their bag of techniques if they want.  I think players with adequate (though perhaps suboptimal) skills for handling pacing on their own may shy away from the dial simply due to unfamiliarity, so it might be worthwhile to try to overcome that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200742/#Comment_200742" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-05T10:18:26+00:00" title="April  5, 2009 10:18AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David:<br/>Oops, missed the link part, but yes, that's pretty much what I was talking about. <br/><br/>It's a really great visual aid that nicely shows something I've tried to write out and explain for a really long time. I hope you don't mind if I steal this thing.<br/><br/>Can I ask a bit more about some actual play use? Your example of two players having different desires for pacing sounds pretty interesting to me.

It's two separate scales, stuck on one sheet of paper for convenience and melded by "most likely combos" logic.<br/><br/>KBob, feel free to use it.  I can even send you a more printer-friendly verison if you want (whisper me about that).  My only request would be that you let me know how it goes!\n<blockquote>Can I ask a bit more about some actual play use? Your example of two players having different desires for pacing sounds pretty interesting to me.</blockquote>My short answer is that the dial helps resolve differences only by highlighting, "Hey, this is a relevant dimension of play that we should interact with, instead of being passively dissatisfied."  I've found that once the players know they can express their pacing desires, then they do, and things tend to get worked out well enough.<br/><br/>I had an idea where game currency could be used to win pacing disputes, but there didn't seem to be much upside to encouraging winner/loser rather than compromise.  In a competitive game, though (which Delve is not), I might try it.\n<blockquote>Also, can you tell me about how it interacts with skills use of characters? Here I'm thinking about the way something like a research, invention, navigation, or repair skill might tend to go with pacing on the right side, while something like combat skills or manuevers will tend towards the left side.</blockquote>There's two things going on, right?  There's the in-game time scale of a resolution, and there's the play coverage of in-game time.  The way these line up in Delve is specific: "what gets played" takes the lead and determines when skill rolls are or aren't made, and how much they cover.  In another system, though, I could easily see letting skill-based resolution mechanics lead, and adjusting the pacing/detail of narration depending on whether a "real time skill" (like a single attack) or a "scene summary skill" (like "research") is being used.\n<blockquote>Does this change at all how players build characters once they've used this track?</blockquote>For the Delve model, no.  But for that latter model I just postulated, I could easily see how it might!  If I was creating a character, I might well pick more "small-scale resolution skills" as a way of pursuing my general preference for high detail.\n<blockquote>Or, how it might interact with any sort of scene-framing?</blockquote>This is huge.  As a GM, this one of my favorite things about the dial.  It lets me know when to flex my visual and atmospheric portraiture skills before a rapt audience, and when to quickly spit out the bare basics.  I honestly wish my players used the dial more for this.  Although, post-dial-use, they <i>have</i> made some definite progress in giving me verbal guidance.\n<blockquote>Does a shift in pace on the track tend to also correspond with the engagement of some sort of resolution mechanic ( official or unofficial)?</blockquote>Shifting doesn't cause any particular mechanic to be employed right then and there.  It just dictates, when the fiction calls for resolution, what scale will be resolved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201273/#Comment_201273" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-08T11:05:34+00:00" title="April  8, 2009 11:05AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">My short answer is that the dial helps resolve differences only by highlighting, "Hey, this is a relevant dimension of play that we should interact with, instead of being passively dissatisfied."
