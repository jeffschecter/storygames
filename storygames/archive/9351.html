For example, why can't you have a highly religious criminal?  Objective &lt;-&gt; subjective might work better for ethics.  Why can't one's development have been physical and mental, and where does emotional development lie on that scale?  Does everyone have some sort of wild gift?  Your scale implies that no one can be without one.<br/><br/>In a way, it's D&amp;D alignment all over again.  Using scales like this means it will be impossible to define certain types of characters.  However, depending on the fiction of your world, that might not be a bad things: a common argument supporting D&amp;D alignment systems is that the D&amp;D world just works like that, with absolutes of good and evil, and very little in the way of grey areas.  You could apply a similar concept to your setting here, though many players may resist that restriction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207302/#Comment_207302" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T09:29:40+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  9:29AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent thoughts, thank you.<br/><br/>I had imagined something like Ethics (Religious 3 / Criminal 2), Development (Physical 4 / Mental 1), etc.  where all the scales were blurred in someway.  This feels right for a number of them (Development - no you can't be both physically and mentally perfect) but for some of the false dichotomies like you called out, it may be problematic.<br/><br/>As you also say, part of it is tied into setting.  Or put differently, setting the scales defines the setting - if Crime and Religion are opposed, then by definition you can't have "a highly religious criminal". <br/><br/>You also called out the two scales I'm struggling the most with.  Wild Gift and Ethics.  I like your suggestion about Objective vs. Subjective.  It gets to what I was after, I think, and parrallels nicely with the Science and Professional practice vs. theory scales.

Shock comes to mind as a game that uses scales to define character abilities.<br/><br/>Specifically---Does every character have a rating in every scale? That would mean that every character has a "Wild Gift" and "Science!"-tific training. Personally, I'm OK with the Religious/Criminal divide, if that's the way you want the setting to work. But the the "Science!" and "Wild Gift" scales seem like they should be optional... Or maybe---maybe you should combine them as something like "Aptitude (Scientific &lt;-&gt; Supernatural [a combination of magic, psychic, and maybe spiritual])".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207318/#Comment_207318" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T10:05:57+00:00" title="May 14, 2009 10:05AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim -<br/><br/>I hadn't really settled on every character having every scale, though I had vaguely assumed they would.<br/><br/>The Science! rating was the first I came up with, an attempt to set the sliding scale between the everyday Engineer - if it exists he can fix it - and the academic Scientist - he can imagine how nearly anything could work, but don't ask him to make it work.  Something that runs the gamut from Engineer to Inventor to Scientist.  But maybe the name of the scale doesn't work....<br/><br/>The Wild Gift is another case, I was thinking about changing the name to "Potential" - to reflect the optional nature. Everyone has some (at least) mild inclination toward one or the other, but not everyone acts on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207402/#Comment_207402" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:12:07+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:12PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see Mad Science as much more applied than theoretical, myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207409/#Comment_207409" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:30:03+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:30PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2009 2:30PM by deadlytoque.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Mike.

We're talking about an era wherein science as we know it was barely defined (and the term not really yet used; depending on your exact moment "natural philosopher" is more likely than "scientist") and wherein almost all discovery came from practical experimentation. Watt didn't improve the Newcomben engine by working it out on paper: he just built a better engine (he <i>claimed</i> to have done all sorts of calculations and observations first, but there isn't a lot of evidence to support the claim).<br/><br/>Using these scales, could you arrange for there to be a cross-sectional nature to them? If you have Engineer/Inventor on one end and Natural Philosopher on the other, you have a "practical/theoretical" dichotomy, which is mirrored in your Ethics and Profession scales.

To be honest, I don't know.  I guess I was thinking of Magic including things like Magic Acadamies and Hedge Wizards and Psychic including Spiritualists, Mediums, and Fortune-Tellers.  <br/><br/>They *might* tap the same thing, with Psychic representing more untrained/raw talents and Magic representing more formalized training.
