Inspired partly by the open atmosphere here at Story Games, I've decided to open my own site up to aspiring game designers/theorists (let's face it, I wasn't using it very much at the present time, anyhow). <br/><br/><b><a href="=http://miscellaneousdebris.freeforums.org/" rel="nofollow">Here are the forums</a></b>. I've finally managed to nail down a decent, ad-free, forum host and upgraded the main site with a snazzy CSS frontend <b><a href="http://miscellaneousdebris.sitesled.com" rel="nofollow">here</a></b>. While I'm certain that it won't be The Next Big Thing, all game theorists and game designers are welcome in the spirit of <i>open</i> discussion. I'll host files on the main site's "Free Games" page and designer/imprint-specific forums by request. <br/><br/>Suggestions for improvement by registered posters are, of course, welcome. Before you ask, Andy, no -- my primary server doesn't support Vanilla <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The rules (see "Welcome" threads in each forum) are loose and sensible. If you act like a human being, you'll be spared banning. If you act like a sociopath, you'll be treated like one. If you like to design/write games (even if they're just for you and your play group), by all means, drop by!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72145/#Comment_72145" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T07:23:10+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  7:23AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Link is broken(well you can extract the actual url from it, just saying).
