Both weapons do the original damage, but there's some penalty for using them: usually a To Hit penalty.<br/><br/>And then there's a skill called two-weapon fighting, which you take, and it almost or completely negates the penalty.<br/><br/>Do <i>any</i> two weapon fighting styles actually work like this?<br/><br/>For example, I know, from learning stage combat, that there's a sword-and-dagger fighting style: your left hand holds a dagger, your right a sword. But they don't <i>add</i> in any sense.<br/><br/>Instead, the dagger is a defensive weapon. Your sword is still the main weapon, but you keep the dagger up to parry strikes from your non-sword side.<br/><br/>Now, OK, sometimes you'll get a lucky thrust in with the dagger. But there's no sense of having twice as many attacks. Or of the two weapons being equal weapons.<br/><br/>So, what other two weapon styles are there? Is there ever a case where you use two weapons together and their effect is additive?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87339/#Comment_87339" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T14:47:48+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  2:47PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In all the cases I can think of, except with handguns, the additional weapon is mainly there for defense, like a shield, while you attack with the other.

Both weapons are used to attack and "defend," though most defensive moves in this style are actually attacks on the opponent's weapon or hands. Kali and Arnis (the styles that Escrima derives from) are similar.<br/><br/>I haven't trained Escrima in a long, long time though. I think Judd is training right now. Maybe he can describe it better.<br/><br/>In general with weapon fighting, "blocking" doesn't really happen the way it does in stage combat. You don't hold your weapon out for it to get hit (and probably damaged). Your weapon is always moving and threatening your opponent. It's the same if you have one weapon or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87357/#Comment_87357" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T15:25:14+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  3:25PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is little-to-no similarity between fighting with one weapon and fighting with that weapon and an additional weapon.

Having two weapons has certain advantages, but in the case of stick fighting, there are disadvantages as well, because it negates your ability to grab the other person or their weapon (unless you're quick enough to drop your second stick in the right moment, which advanced fighters do).<br/><br/>It doesn't mean you always get twice the hits in, but it does allow you to keep your opponent threatened directly after a strike, and it allows for flurries/combinations. It certainly does NOT make it harder to strike, and in fact, combinations are almost always more likely to hit and to inflict damage than single attacks, which is why all modern martial arts work with combinations.<br/><br/>It's actually more difficult to defend against two weapons because you have to keep both in focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87403/#Comment_87403" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T17:02:32+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  5:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2 brass knuckles.<br/><br/>Teeth + claws.<br/><br/>pepperspray + nightstick.<br/><br/>stomp toes + shove.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87436/#Comment_87436" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T22:52:08+00:00" title="August 10, 2007 10:52PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its about angles.

The RPG notion of a shield as a sort of optional defensive extra that makes no difference to fighting style, etc., is nonsense.<br/><br/>I used to fight quite a lot with a short sword in my right hand and a short axe in my left. The main advantage of this style is that if you parry successfully with the axe, you can often lock the opposing fighter's weapon, at least for a short time. And sometimes you can parry with the sword and attack with the axe instead, for variety. But generally you're only attacking with one weapon at once. The disadvantage of fighting with two weapons is that you have to be a lot more accurate with your parries, and it's difficult to defend against more than one opponent at once. In a defensive line, facing a shield wall, you either break through or die quickly. Probably both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87471/#Comment_87471" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T07:17:51+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  7:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in movies you have these guys with two swords chopping away like crazy.

There are two kinds of two-weapon fight. If the there is a first and second weapon, than the second weapon will only raise your defense, but you still use the original skill for the first weapon. (It's probably not exactly like this, but almost. I think you can choose to defend with it or to attack, I can't remember right now.) But the important thing is: the second weapon is not handled as a seperate weapon with its own attack-per-round, but only gives bonus for your values. It doesn't works like: you have two weapons, you attack twice as much, wich I think is netto bullshit, considering one "attack" is not one slash, but something more complex.<br/><br/>And there is another way, wich is more interesting: if the two weapons are equal, then you have to learn a seperate skill wich is harder to learn than the one-weapon skill. A pair of weapons is just like as it would be a completely different weapon.<br/><br/>It makes sense, because it's not the weapon you learn, but the skill to use a weapon. If the techniqe is totally different, you need to have a totally different skill.<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88026/#Comment_88026" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T11:11:02+00:00" title="August 14, 2007 11:11AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm surprised no-one has mentioned the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoho_Niten_Ichi-ryu" rel="nofollow">Hy\xc5\x8dh\xc5\x8d Niten Ichi-ry\xc5\xab</a> technique of Miyamoto Musashi yet. <br/>He was kick ass with all kinds of weapons and developed a two sword fighting style. <br/>Ain't wikipedia grand?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88043/#Comment_88043" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T12:34:05+00:00" title="August 14, 2007 12:34PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2007 12:34PM by Rich Stokes.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often attack pies with both a knife <b>and</b> a fork.

I sense that those who are discussing how two-weapon fighting works from the martial arts point of view are more interested in how to emulate those effects in-game, which is probably more in line with the original intent of the thread.  But I could see hating the way most RPG's handle two-weapon fighting from either point of view.  On the one hand, it doesn't emulate reality, on the other, it usually doesn't allow for cool effects.  So perhaps that sentence is two points, expressing orthogonal ideas...<br/><br/>BTW, I want a system that allows me to do cool little stunts like Darth Maul or Neo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88075/#Comment_88075" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T16:01:45+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  4:01PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I haven't found a game where the threat/concentration factors into a fight.</blockquote>\nDude, word.

Giorgio e il Drago</a>), scripted but full contact, with full armor, and ANYTHING is a weapon. <br/><br/>A man with hauberk, armored gloves, helm, shield and sword is a COLLECTION of weapons. Single weapon, my shiny armored ass :-D<br/><br/>They taught me that the butt of the sword is really good to strike unexpectedly, for example. The hilt of the sword, used as a hammer, can pierce helmet and skull if using a crusader style, flat helmet that does not deflect the blow. The armored glove (the segmented type) is wonderful for hitting people in the vitals, and often has a spiky end. And a shield has at least 3 pointy metal bits, let alone the powerful shoves you can give with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88503/#Comment_88503" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T00:17:46+00:00" title="August 17, 2007 12:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget the steel capped boots!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
