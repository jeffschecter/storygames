I'm looking for examples of these specific types of roleplaying, for which players are rewarded with narrative authority, in different RPGs.  <br/><br/>Examples:<br/>In <b>Fate</b>, narrative authority is rewarded when players intentionally fail their objectives.<br/><br/>In <b>House of Spiders</b> a player is rewarded narrative authority for reincorporating an element of the narrative that another player previously introduced into the narrative.

The reward is somewhat detached in that regard, but it's ultimately the same thing, I think.<br/><br/>A typical reason for rewards that you didn't touch upon yet is playing a consistent character. "Good roleplaying" or "hitting your Keys" or whatever. Individual games (and groups) differ in how they emphasize consistency vs. powerful projection.<br/><br/>And, of course, the classic answer is that purposeful play gets rewarded: finishing the mission and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476167/#Comment_476167" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-16T18:00:20+00:00" title="August 16, 2018  6:00PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's really true that character advancement is a form of narrative authority.  Certainly, I don't think most people playing D&amp;D think anything along the lines of "Oh good, I've gained a level, I can have a bigger impact on the story now."   So I'm not really convinced it's the same thing.  I think "power in the game world" is a different animal, and is a very big carrot for some players even though it's mostly meaningless in a lot of games.<br/><br/>But yes, the common ones that I see are:<br/>* Roleplaying a Certain Way (like Eero suggests - 'good roleplaying' or 'hitting your keys' or similar)<br/>* Making trouble for yourself -- Fate compels, "When you struggle with issues from your Vice or Trauma" in Blades in the Dark<br/>* Drama/Hamming it up -- Aiki in Tenra Bansho Zero<br/>* Doing something cute/heartwarming or that helped someone else - Dreams, in Golden Sky Stories.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, what behavior you reward is dependent on what the game is about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476169/#Comment_476169" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-16T19:09:33+00:00" title="August 16, 2018  7:09PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe a stretch, but PBTA games mostly feature the GM deliberately incorporating player ideas and input into the setting, so this creates a kind of feedback loop where the player who creates a PC with an interesting backstory and complications has a bigger influence over the narration than the player whose PC is a straightforward guy with no entanglements.

And that's almost all of them. The question, at least for me, is a bit overwhelming.<br/><br/>Here's another example:<br/><br/>Lots of games reward you with narrative authority for later use when you give up narrative authority now. For instance, in <i>Dream Askew</i> you can choose to give in to another character's "move" and earn a token, which you might use to push your own agenda in a future scene.<br/><br/>(These games tend to rely on social contract for the players not to abuse those rules in the moment, though - for instance, it's not generally considered "fair play" to immediately spend that token to "win" again.)<br/><br/>In <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>, you get to put your name on the Owe List when you go into a conflict with someone stronger than you (whether you win or lose, which is cool). Being on the List allows you to have your character appear in a future Chapter, as well as choose an element for inclusion in that Chapter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476232/#Comment_476232" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-20T22:51:17+00:00" title="August 20, 2018 10:51PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the purpose of 'winning narrative control' isnt so much about spreading the allocation of narrative control, but doing something the game wants you to do in order to earn a resource - a resource that in this case, happens to be 'narrative control'<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482947/#Comment_482947" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-05T10:46:16+00:00" title="May  5, 2019 10:46AM">May 5</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2019 10:47AM by Rickard.">edited May 5</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In <b>Fate</b>, narrative authority is rewarded when players intentionally fail their objectives.<br/><br/>In <b>House of Spiders</b> a player is rewarded narrative authority for reincorporating an element of the narrative that another player previously introduced into the narrative.
