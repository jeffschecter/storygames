Looking at them, the observer is profoundly moved by the depth of emotional engagement going on. Yeah, the game doesn't *sound* like it would be that much fun, from an outside perspective, but those kids are in it 110%.<br/><br/>I have some amazing memories of early roleplaying experiences - the willingness to suspend disbelief was <i>just so strong</i>.<br/><br/>Paul Czege commented, and said that aside from a first few experiences, he's never felt that gaming was really an "escapist" pastime. Rather, for him, it's a creative outlet.<br/><br/>I've always thought that was one of the "unspoken" reasons people drop out of the hobby as they get older. It's not just social pressure and lack of time, etc - it's also a different attitude to the game itself which makes it less fun.<br/><br/>When you live a relatively controlled life, and the game is your only way to experience agency and have adventure, it packs a very different punch.<br/><br/>To a kid, playing an RPG gives you control of your fate and puts important decisions into your hands. To many adults, the level of freedom and responsibility might be far less than in real life. Why, then, play an RPG?<br/><br/>I think that, for me - and probably many others - gaming can be part creative outlet and part a quest to recapture some of that early wonder, that immersive magic.<br/><br/>I suppose I have a similar relationship to books, as well.<br/><br/>What has your experience been like?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460377/#Comment_460377" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-17T05:59:32+00:00" title="February 17, 2017  5:59AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting topic. The phenomenon is real, but I don't think it's about life control, as you posit; rather, to me it seems (based on observing younger players, and memories from my own teenage years) that it's mostly a simple novelty factor. Older gamers don't get the same rush because they're used to the things that rpgs offer, and take them for granted. It doesn't feel so "magical" because you have a clearer understanding of how the sausage is made, and a good sense for how different choices you might make in the game will pan out. People who play for the first time as an adult may also not get quite the same rush, but that's just because they have less free time and more distractions in their lives, and thus they are less likely to really concentrate in the gaming.<br/><br/>A quest to capture that early magic is a really common creative inspiration for gamers, too. Of course, being as how I believe the magic to be simple novelty, I think it's largely an illusionary errand. Nevertheless, there are ways to get closer to that mindset, and they overlap some with generally useful artistic attitudes: I think that a roleplayer who participates in the game with an open mind, drops their preconceptions, practices mindfulness and focuses on the fundamentals will capture at least a little bit of that early feel.<br/><br/>The concept of "immersion", and the associated artistic movement of immersionism, is largely driven by these sorts of early experiences, I think. The immersion-seeking gamer desires the "magic feeling" and chases after it - essentially constructs their game around the activity of attempting to achieve the magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460378/#Comment_460378" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-17T06:14:12+00:00" title="February 17, 2017  6:14AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2017 6:19AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me tha "magic feeling" was more of a result of being a kid, all make-believe was more immersive and I could "live" more in my imagination. I remember playing a game with friends where we had two clubs ran by different friends that would play against each other. All we did is pretend that our pointed finger was a gun and if we saw another person (like when hiding in a bush or sticking our head out  around the corner of the house) we would pretend to shoot the other person and whoever was shot first would play dead and be out of the game. We would play this game until there was only one person left and everyone else was dead. This game occupied or imagination for hours and hours and hours; we probably played for a year or more. I think that the reason we were so immersed was mostly because we were kids and that's when you can get really immersed in your imagination. I remember being a little kid and wishing the world was like D&amp;D, and how much better it would be than the real world. So I started D&amp;D in grade school  and I think it was just being a kid that made it magical. At least for me :-)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460385/#Comment_460385" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-17T14:25:05+00:00" title="February 17, 2017  2:25PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like both arguments of novelty and being a kid may be closer that we believe on this subject. Despite the differences, both share a common point: the inexperience. A seasoned adventurer is less proned to be surprised when a beholder appears in front of her. She will probably think of her options and tactic in a colder way, comparing it to the first time she faced it. It doesn't only limit to in-game experience, but to real-world experience as well, and familiarity with how fiction works in general. <br/><br/>The older we are, the easier is for us to see (due to our experience) all the mirrors and smoke hiding and distracting us from how the magic is done, so believing in magic and getting amazed by the act becomes harder.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460389/#Comment_460389" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-17T15:04:45+00:00" title="February 17, 2017  3:04PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2017 3:22PM by komradebob.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the magic starts to disappear as the <i>game</i> aspect becomes more of a focus than the<i> play </i>aspect.<br/><br/>To an extent, this is a result of novelty, as noted, but that often coincides with an age element, due to the fact that people often start playing these things relatively young.<br/><br/>This is my experience with this stuff. Some other folks maybe can relate.<br/><br/>I started with D&amp;D relatively youngish, a preteen. I had Play Pretend under my belt. I had some boardgames under my belt. RPGs were a very cool combo of the two. I could still Play Pretend, but since it was a <i>game</i>, it felt a bit more<i> adult</i>.<br/><br/>And feeling a bit adult is important to a kid.<br/><br/>Eventually, in a few short years, I was digging more and more into mechanical systems. More was better, ore realism/intricacy was Good! I was mastering it all, and Mastery of something is also very adult! This too is Good!<br/><br/>And with age, came changing subject matter.<i> Obviously</i> Vampire was better than D&amp;D! It was system mastery + not-kiddie topics! Capital-G Good once more!<br/><br/>Somewhere along the lines, I started getting into what is usually termed a <i>System Doesn't Matter</i> mindset. This may be the first indication that I was moving away from the need for <i>game</i>. I was older, I'd mastered these mechanics of different systems, and I was starting to value <i>play</i> once more, and more than I valued <i>game</i>.<br/><br/>After all, I had proper games to play if I wanted them. The draw of RPGs was the <i>play</i> aspect, regardless of where a particular game fell on a spectrum of goofy&lt;-&gt;serious topic matter.<br/><br/>[Now, I've come to understand what people mean by "System Matters", so leave that aside for a bit. ]<br/><br/>For me, this little journey in the hobby and changing attitudes isn't so much a circular journey, as more like a spiral or spring coil. It only looks like a circle if you're viewing it straight down the tube.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460390/#Comment_460390" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-17T15:10:50+00:00" title="February 17, 2017  3:10PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm going to throw my support to the "novelty" angle as well;  It's not the same thing, but Everquest was AMAZING when I knew nothing about it, and had no idea what was over the next hill or what the next zone over even was or what I might find there, and no MMO since, even though I'm SURE they are better games, has come anywhere near to capturing that experience.<br/><br/>You can't go home again.<br/><br/>Actually though, this is one of the reasons I love BOOKS.

It is freedom for its own sake. But this also makes play in a certain sense a higher level concept than games: <b>play can create games, it can generate rules \u2013 in fact, it inevitably does produce at least tacit ones, since sheer random playing around soon becomes boring</b> \u2013 but therefore by definition play cannot itself be intrinsically rule-bound. This is all the more true when play becomes social. Studies of children\u2019s play, for example, inevitably discover that <b>children playing imaginary games spend at least as much time arguing about the rules than they do actually playing them. Such arguments become a form of play in themselves.</b><br/>...<br/>[T]here is also something potentially terrifying about play for just this reason. Because this open-ended creativity is also what allows it to be randomly destructive. Cats play with mice. Pulling the wings off the flies is also a form of play. Playful gods are rarely ones any sane person would desire to encounter.<br/>Let me put forth a suggestion, then. What ultimately lies behind the appeal of bureaucracy is fear of play.</blockquote>\nCould our shift away from "the magic" be a pragmatic one, even if we lament the things we lose in the process? Are we instinctively trying to set boundaries for ourselves as a kind of defense mechanism against "failed play," and/or as a necessary part of creating the social conditions required to keep playing/gaming? Is the magic just another example of "20 minutes of fun" that we should get over? Is it paradoxical to try to recapture the magic by creating rules that encourage rather than stifle play (in Graeber's sense of the word)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460428/#Comment_460428" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-19T12:53:32+00:00" title="February 19, 2017 12:53PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2017 1:12PM by komradebob.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If children do argue half the time in imaginative play, they still have a higher Fun:Not-Fun ratio (1:1) than in the phrase "20 minutes of fun in 4 hours of gaming*" (1:11).<br/><br/>[*I've generally assumed the phrase was an exaggeration for effect, and the ratio was never quite that bad in practice]<br/><br/>I guess those kids are doing okay after all!<br/><br/>I certainly remember people presenting RPG rules as a way of putting an end to those sorts of argument in imaginative play especially when I was young. And, like many kids, that had a great appeal. Who wouldn't want to do imaginative play without the arguments?  I mean,  think everyone remembers those unhappy arguments as much as all of the good, fun times where it didn't occur. Heck, many of us probably remember an example of that more clearly than all the times we played and there were no problems.<br/><br/>Having bought into the argument about the necessity and desirability of rules in RPGs to prevent these things, I can't say the rules I encountered early on ever really were built to address <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">why </span></i>those arguments in childhood imaginative play occurred.<br/><br/>I mean, really, what's the classic, go-to example?<br/><br/><b>Little Jimmy</b>:<i>I shot ya!</i><br/><b>Little Billy</b>: <i>No ya didn't! </i><br/><br/>[Argument ensues]<br/><br/>RPG rules are like some dude stepping in and saying:<br/><br/><b>Rule-Dude</b>: <i>Now Little Billy, according to the physics of this situation, Little Jimmy did in fact shoot you, and here's why...</i> [ draws diagram on wipe board, uses maths in examples]<br/><br/><b>Little Billy</b>: <i>Oh!

Little Jimmy didn't misunderstand the modeling of the physics! <br/><br/>Little Jimmy thought that accepting being shot would lead to sucky, in-fun play for him. Or, maybe, even no  play at all for him, at least temporarily.<br/><br/>It took me rather a lot of time to understand that second bit, long after I had grown up, and to see implications for game design coming out of that insight.<br/><br/>Arguably, RPG rules, even those early rules I encountered that I'm referring to upthread, were never actually designed to deal with the real problem Little Jimmy and Little Billy are having, but they got "sold" to you KomradeBob that way.

I've been in game tables with roughly that ratio (let's say it swings between 1:10 and 1:20 every session in practice) so many times and so reliably that I can usually tell when it's going to be one of those games after the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>Heck, I actually just returned from a 4-hour session of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> that fulfilled this description. It's one of those side games you end up engaging out of courtesy, and the only way for me to count more than 10 minutes of fun out of that session is if I consider relaxed daydreaming while waiting for stuff to happen to be "fun". It was the fifth session of a campaign, and every one's had roughly that same ratio. (Yes, if somebody's wondering: I am that patient, if this is what it takes to get an old friend back into GMing.)<br/><br/>Of course, because "fun" is subjective, it'd be difficult to point to an objectively quantifiable example of actual play that everybody agreed was like this.

Smoke and mirrors, in other words.<br/><br/>However, as smoke and mirrors is our stock in trade, there's no particular reason why we couldn't try to recreate that magic with deliberate game design. I suggest the following recipe:<br/><b>*</b> Stop gaming for five years. Cold turkey.<br/><b>*</b> Start gaming again, except do it with kids. Preferably your own, makes it easier to have patience with them. Don't expect consistent fun, and remember: the success will be more cherished once you stumble on it for a short moment at some point.<br/><b>*</b> Wait a few years for the nostalgia to set in. Reminisce about how fun it was. Perhaps mix in some delusions about how your kids liked you more before they grew up and became teenagers themselves.<br/><br/>See? Easy <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>More seriously, though, there's a surfeit of convincing observations in this thread. Jeff and Bob's stuff about childhood imaginary play being different has merit, I think: I recommend that if anybody here is working on an immersive game design, consider those points well.<br/><br/>One thing I'd like to add is that while some people really go for the nostalgia thing as a creative drive in their roleplaying, some other people seek a similar fix from other sources. For me personally the fix comes from advancing my gaming art, which makes me think that the novelty factor is a major ingredient in the sense of wonder: my experience last year when I got <i>Paranoia</i> to work correctly was similar to the sense of wonder in my first successful Call of Cthulhu session in '94 or whenever it was. They were both similar to the feeling of a fully accomplished old school D&amp;D campaign in 2010, or my first game of Zombie Cinema in 2006, or Dust Devils in 2005, or My Life with Master in 2003... every time I've played a new, fresh type of roleplaying game in a highly successful manner, the rush has been somewhat similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460446/#Comment_460446" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T14:08:24+00:00" title="February 20, 2017  2:08PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Huh.

I think this is further supported by the way the setting naturally also evolves and becomes fleshed out at the same time.<br/><br/>So, that's a solid positive.<br/><br/>Here's where I see the negative. The above is such a strong positive that it begins to define the ideal for gaming culture and choke out all other options in gamer-mindspace.<br/>I mean that in both design-style and in general gamer attitude.<br/><br/>Leaving design-space aside for a moment, it tends to create a situation that I've experienced where gamers simply outright refuse to try any game/system/setting that doesn't promise that situation and will even refuse to play a game that does promise that if they can't co-ordinate a certain minimum sized play group willing to devote themselves to that end indefinitely.<br/><br/>With design thinking, it gets into mutual feedback cycle.<br/><br/>So that's my reasoning anyway.<br/><br/>How it relates to the thrust of this thread:<br/><br/>I think that this style of play inherently brings in a certain level of "seriousness" over time.<br/><br/>As play evolves naturally from lightweight and even stereotypical, very surface, to something more idiosyncratic through play, it does hit a space of peak balance, but then it lives a bit beyond that really good balance and that's when you start to see things like GM burnout and "zombie" campaigns where people show up, but have a kind of nostalgia for their own campaign and its earlier stages.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460453/#Comment_460453" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T15:29:31+00:00" title="February 20, 2017  3:29PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it was the novelty, the cameraderie, and the great stories, and finally being the hero.

Thus I discovered jeepform, bleed, and later, Nordic Larp. <br/>Nordic Freeform was old hat because we'd sort of always played that way (always being about a decade before the term was coined).<br/>Then, I rediscovered campaign play, and rediscovered my frustration with old systems, because everything took such a bloody long time.

I posited that what happens to more long-time gamers, in part, is that they simply have more bad experiences that make it harder for them to open up and be fully vulnerable and creative.<br/><br/>Sure, some of it is just the inevitable "you can't go home again" effect, or the natural outgrowth of what happens when you learn to GM, for instance. But some of it, I argue, is running up against barriers *that shouldn't be there in the first place.* GMs shutting down genuine creativity that should be contributory, mainly.<br/><br/>FWIW, I had &lt;5 minutes of fun in a 4-hour session on Thursday. :-/<br/><br/>But the thing is, I had some real moments of amazement and fun and wonder the rest of the con, in at least some of my games, including ones I was GMing. Precisely because I knew exactly what had gone wrong in my Thursday game, that one bad experience didn't really hamper me in any sort of long-term way. So I do think it's possible to "level up" *past* the point where you become jaded by bad experiences, if you can diagnose and get past them.

Polaris is fantastic, but only if everyone's clear that it's not any more of a substitute for your epic D&amp;D homebrew campaign than a game of football would be.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, and that's the problem I see.<br/><br/>It's a bit like someone who gets introduced to TV entertainment, falls in love with a US style program that is designed to go on without end (until it eventually dies and is cancelled), but just can't get into movies as a medium, because they're "too self-contained" and they can't get into the plot or characters because 2-3 hours is just too little time for them to appreciate the thing.<br/><br/>Except, that's everyone in the viewing public, and the art of making a movie, creating a self-contained 2-3 hour story, never gets developed.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460472/#Comment_460472" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-21T00:50:19+00:00" title="February 21, 2017 12:50AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2017 12:50AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed that it ain't ideal for the evolution of related-but-different art forms.<br/><br/>I wonder, though, if more players felt they'd <i>completely</i> scratched that immersive campaign itch, and it was no longer a thing they were seeking with intermittent success, if that might calm things down a bit.

I think K-Bob and I are communicating just fine, but I don't wanna be insular, so here's what I really think:<br/><br/>It is possible to immerse in almost <i>any</i> type of RPG play, especially given that few people agree on a precise definition of immersion.  Even leaving that disagreement aside, it is even possible to get the same <i>type</i> of immersion -- e.g. character embodiment -- using all sorts of different games and approaches.<br/><br/>Just because it's possible doesn't mean all approaches are equally immersion-facilitating for all people, though.  For some players, it's all about the rules -- are they quick to use, are they realistic, are they familiar, are they clear, do they reward IC or OOC thinking?  For other players, it's all about the situation -- is there something compelling for my character to do here?  Some players rely on character -- do I know how my character would react to this and what they would care about, or are they kind of rough-sketchy in my mind?  There's also the perspective that to immerse in a different person and place, you need to get to know them, making immersion a slow-burn phenomenon that requires campaign play, or at least more than a one-shot or two-shot.<br/><br/>In my experience, the more of these questions we answer in the most obviously immersion-friendly way, the more immersion-seekers we'll please.  Give me a developed character, something compelling for them to do, a system that rewards me for doing it as that character rather than as Dave At A Game Table, a long-running game, and a group that wants to immerse, and I like my immersive odds!  If you give me just the "compelling thing to do" and "group goal of immersion" parts, honestly, I <i>still</i> like my odds, but I think a lot of other people don't.  Sometimes character or system or duration is very, very important to people on this front.<br/><br/>As for the appeal of immersion, I think it can vary in degree from "nice bonus on top" to "primary reason to roleplay".  People discover, and try out, and fall in love with roleplaying for all sorts of reasons, but a major one seems to be a sense of transportation, leaving their sense of being their real self in the real world and instead experiencing something else.  It doesn't surprise me that many gamers get really into that aspect of play -- it's intuitively appealing to me in a way I can't concisely explain, but I think kids' "play pretend" and the popularity of first-person videogames give us hints.<br/><br/>Well, when that's the part you're most into, that's the part you want more of.  If a different game or group or setting or type of character or whatever <i>doesn't</i> get you that same sense of leaving reality behind and being someone else somewhere else, then you still have that itch unscratched.  There's no need to hate on the new thing you tried, but it still makes sense to go back to the old thing you want more of.<br/><br/>For players who latch onto some aspect of roleplay <i>other</i> than immersion, you see a similar phenomenon with the part <i>they</i> like.  Players who fall in love with tangible progress systems like XP and level-ups can be dissatisfied by games where characters don't evolve that way.  Players who fall in love with puzzle-solving can be bored by character exploration; players who fall in love with character exploration can be bored by puzzle-solving; etc.  I don't know if there's anything special about immersion on this front -- maybe it's harder to pin down, agree upon, and thus collectively pursue?  (Or maybe not -- I've seen folks pursuing "meaningful story" fail to agree on what <i>that</i> means aplenty!  And I've seen folks who love <i>both</i> immersion and Good Story contend that both should <i>emerge naturally</i> rather than being actively pursued!)<br/><br/>So, that's my take.  <br/><br/>Sorry if I gave a different impression earlier.  I probably should have used a tongue-sticking-out emoji or something to make it obvious that I was just messing with Bob in a friendly way.<br/><br/>I'm one of those people who loves immersion, but I love other things too, and I'm happy to play unimmersive sessions or games, and I readily acknowledge that many many gamers have great play experiences without my kind of immersion, or without any kind of immersion.  Of course they would!  Just because I love yams, does that mean I should expect <i>everyone</i> to love yams?  Of course not.  Or that <i>every meal</i> should involve yams?  Hell no!  All it is, is that, if I haven't had yams in a while, I want me some yams!  And I can understand it when other folks are in the same boat.  Mmm, immersion and yams...\n<blockquote>I submit that it's because immersive play with traditional systems fails so much.  They've either experienced it a few times briefly and don't understand why they can't get it back</blockquote>Are you saying immersive play with traditional systems often fails to immersive, or often fails to be fun?  I'm sure the former happens too much, but the bigger problem I've seen has been latter.  Groups who are so intent on not spoiling anyone's immersion that they completely cut themselves off from useful tools to communicate or troubleshoot or make the game exciting -- this seems unfortunately common.  And then the immersion itself, while still sort of in operation, is diluted, because how riveting is it really to be deeply inside a fiction that's boring or frustrating?\n<blockquote>or they've been told by people (like you, sorry) that it is the most amazing thing ever and they are frustrated by their inability to get there</blockquote>It's true!  We all talk about the moments we remember and love best, and most of mine were very immersive!  Check out these yams, y'all!  You gotta try 'em!  I have devoted a decade of design thought and intermittent work to sharing it with others.  I see that experience of frustration you mention as emerging from a very confused history of play that immersion-lovers should strive to put behind us.  Games should provide better tools, groups should communicate more before play, and players should be less fussy.  I think we can do it!  My success ratio running Delve at home is pretty close to 100%, and at cons probably upward of 70%, despite being one-shots in loud rooms etc.<br/><br/>(I certainly would not push Delve or immersive play any harder than I'd push yams, though.)\n<blockquote>so they feel a need to defend themselves, rather than admit failure and try something else.</blockquote>Yeah.  It can get ugly.  I wish people started looking to the rules and procedures, and maybe their own tastes and desires, rather than viewing immersive play as a personal victory or failure.  I suspect the defensiveness comes out of the player-GM split, where both "sides" feel some urge to blame the other.  This is why I define immersion as a <i>full group</i> goal in Delve, with the GM basically on the players' side in most facets of play.\n<blockquote>Though yes, I do concede that a portion of it does also appear to be rooted in the fact that they feel like they can't try anything because they believe that new things take weeks to learn and years to experience, because how can you immerse yourself in anything less?</blockquote>My best guess is that the "too much investment to learn a new approach" expectation comes from most people starting by taking 6 hours to make a D&amp;D character and many sessions to gain system proficiency and then thinking "so this is roleplaying".  But perhaps you're right and it's more about campaign play and immersion or other traditionally slow-burn virtues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460519/#Comment_460519" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T05:39:07+00:00" title="February 22, 2017  5:39AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David Berg: Internet yammersionist.<br/><br/>FWIW, I'm someone who played a shit-ton of story games, of the most out there sort, very aggressively for a number of years, say from 2006 through about 2012-3. And I still play them quite a bit, especially at cons, but even sometimes at home with friends. But I do crave that long-playing campaign experience, though preferably with a more modern system. In a certain sense, although certainly story-games are fun in their own right, they also serve as *training* for how to be a better roleplayer, how to understand systems better, etc., which I can then take to running 5E (or even BW, which, for all its goodness, is helped immensely by having a broad-ranging familiarity with other RPGs, for my money).<br/><br/>So in a certain sense, the traditionally-structured campaign has always remained my goal, despite departing from it in my actual play practices quite thoroughly. For me, there's a specific magic that I've still never, after all these years, managed to capture: play D&amp;D from 1st level, and have the game go to a moderately high level and then end in a satisfying way. I've done it as a GM, but never as a player. Maybe someday I will.<br/><br/>Not sure that has anything, for me, to do with immersion.

They have a set up, core characters you are introduced to ( the equivalent of PCs), and while, over the course of time, those characters get more fleshed out, they don't generally change a huge amount. Each episode has a problem, the characters tackle it, and it's largely a re-set next episode.<br/><br/>I've been binge watching Perry Mason episodes recently, so this is on my mind. And that seems to have been a fairly common approach to TV programs really up until the late '80s.<br/><br/>In terms of an RPG, this would be closest, I guess, to module play. Here I mean older modules. The PCs get involved, play through it, and are done. On to the next module. In practical terms, the players are unlikely to play through the whole thing in one sitting ( it'll probably take 3-5 sessions, but probably not many more than that), but once it's done, the thing is wrapped up, and we reset for the next module.<br/><br/>The nice thing with this concept is you have long-running and the benefits of that, but you can break open space for other games to be played, especially if they're either one-off ( lots of dirty hippy games are good for that), or also fairly episodic themselves ( Call of Cthulhu comes to mind, as do lots of older Superhero games).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460528/#Comment_460528" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T15:30:59+00:00" title="February 22, 2017  3:30PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for clarifying, Dave.  That helps a lot. A couple of comments:\n<blockquote>Are you saying immersive play with traditional systems often fails to immersive, or often fails to be fun? </blockquote>\nWell, both in this context, because we're presumably dealing with a group of immersion seekers who define their fun as immersion, but who probably don't realize that their immersion is connected to their fun the other way too, so when the game doesn't work, it's a fail across the board.\n<blockquote><br/>I'm sure the former happens too much, but the bigger problem I've seen has been latter.  Groups who are so intent on not spoiling anyone's immersion that they completely cut themselves off from useful tools to communicate or troubleshoot or make the game exciting -- this seems unfortunately common.  And then the immersion itself, while still sort of in operation, is diluted, because how riveting is it really to be deeply inside a fiction that's boring or frustrating?</blockquote>\nYeah; I've definitely done this. I was actually in a d6 Star Wars game where at one point all the characters just... got jobs on some random planet.  It was dumb and boring and not really any fun, but doggone it, it "made sense" and we didn't know any better, and our quest for doing everything... we didn't have the word "immersively" but rather just "the way our characters would" made for a terrible game.  Maybe we were immersed, but who wants to be immersed in that?\n<blockquote>I see that experience of frustration you mention as emerging from a very confused history of play that immersion-lovers should strive to put behind us. </blockquote>\nYes. The problem that is that the people I see being MOST attached to old games with dubious processes is the immersionist crew, who seem to (hyperbole warning!) think "Because I successfully immersed in an OD&amp;D Game once in 1978, that that is the best system for immersion, and everything else is a problem."

We didn't really see any other way forward at the time.  I forget why - it was a long time ago.  So unfortunately, even "priming the pump" with characters who are interested in having cool space adventures is a problem if the means or availability of cool space adventures isn't there.

They just want to gather around the table and "roleplay without touching the dice" unless they need to "resolve something that can't be resolved by roleplaying" - like combat, apparently, though I've never really figured out why it's okay for roleplaying to be the sole decider of whether you convince the king to go to war, but not okay for it to be the decider of whether you can successfully knife a guy in an alley.

I had no idea.\n<blockquote>That GM stuff was <i>advice</i> that didn't rise to the level of <i>required procedure </i>much less <i>rules</i>.<br/><br/>No surprise I'd skipped it, and yet skipping led to repeated failure.</blockquote>Agreed.  I mean, hell, I'd even take advice, if it were, like, one page of really clear advice out of some 16-page document.  But a slew of best practices scattered throughout a 300-page tome?  Forget it.  (I also vaguely recall someone pulling up contradictory advice from different parts of some Vampire book, but I'm fuzzy on the details.)<br/><br/>I don't know if Vampire really has the option to do what I do for Delve, though.  In Delve, there's one basic thing you must get on board with to play.  In Vampire, I think you have more than one option for the basic thing your play is going to be about.  I think this is part of the breadth of traditional RPGs' appeal -- they let players of diverse tastes all imagine doing what they want with this cool collection of toys and tools.  If the Vampire book conveyed to everyone, "Here is the One Right Way to play this game," they might lose four fifths of their sales!\n<blockquote>My strong suspicion is that the second half is really what makes Immersion work. When someone says: "I want the rules to get out of the way", add the phrase "...of all of our successful unwritten system stuff" mentally and the whole thing begins to make sense.</blockquote>I agree with your description of how it's largely worked, historically.  I don't think immersion <i>has</i> to rely on informal system, though.  I mean, in D&amp;D maybe it does, but in Puppetland it definitely does not.  The rule that you can only talk in character has a <i>huge</i> role in that game's flavor of immersion.<br/><br/>I don't use quite that strict a rule for Delve, but I do have rules for clearly distinguishing between IC and OOC speech, and it helps.\n<blockquote>And yeah, I do see a whole lot of resistance to examining, cataloguing, and discussing what those unwritten, but highly important system bits are, much less consider formalizing them.</blockquote>I wonder if this is a GM thing?  "Have a good GM" is one of those bits of longstanding wisdom for fun immersive play, and I don't see many of those GMs being eager to say, "Aw, shucks, guys, I'm not that special, anyone could do what I do, and let's try to nail down what that is!"  Instead good immersive GMing is viewed as a very personal sort of creative expression, or as a level of mastery never to be approached without years of honing the craft, or as a closed club reserved for those who host the sessions and pay the money for the books, etc.<br/><br/>Or maybe it's not about any sort of elitism; maybe it's just hard to imagine another GM using my GMing techniques.  It's true that different GMs foster immersion in different ways.  Some, it's with intense acting.  Others, with prepping the play space.  Others, by handling all of the mechanics and work so the players can just stay in character.  You can't reasonably ask those three GMs to just trade places; maybe the mechanics-handler sucks at acting and finds room prep a chore.  Starting with that take on things, it's easy to give up the analysis before we ever get to a lot of the key techniques, like how we establish when the fiction should and shouldn't require a skill check.\n<blockquote>It becomes an odd sort of apprenticeship.</blockquote>Yeah.

The Gm needs to have some kind of vision of what the starting point is going to be for the campaign, and its initial "thrust" along with stuff like themes and motifs and so on. And, really, the GM is supposed to be a bit of an enforcer of this, at least initially. They really need to communicate this stuff clearly to the players, and be willing to say No to players who want to come up with PCs wildly off the concept.<br/><br/>Likewise, the GMs are really supposed to run prelude sessions with character players, something about the pre-Vamp or early vamp life of the characters. While it's supposed to be one on one, it would probably also be better one-on-one with the rest of the group present.\n<blockquote>I think a lot of immersionist players don't even think they HAVE unwritten stuff to codify. </blockquote>\nPretty much this, although in fairness, most of those immersionist players are going to tend to be PCs, not GMs.<br/><br/>IME, there are tons of RPers who have never opened a rulebook, or who have never looked at rules beyond what they need to use to build/play their character. They <i>might</i> read some setting stuff if it's available to character players. ( heck, I've been in a 5E D&amp;D campaign for over a year, and that's been my attitude the whole time). I suspect this is enormously common. Certainly in the early days of my hobby experience, it was felt that only the GM needed to own the book(s) at all, and players might borrow them if they were really, really interested.\n<blockquote>I remain a little mystified by retroclones, because I have no actual fondness for anything mechanical from early editions of D&amp;D - and I cut my teeth of Mentzer.

I think that's partly key to the thing. It's easy to forget as an RPG hobbyist that most non-hobbyists consider games more complex than Yahtzee or Clue terribly complex. Even some of those old TSR games that came in at 64 pages or so seem mind-bogglingly complex in that context, when your previous experience with complexity is defined by Monopoly.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460659/#Comment_460659" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T16:02:56+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  4:02PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I wonder if this is a GM thing?  "Have a good GM" is one of those bits of longstanding wisdom for fun immersive play, and I don't see many of those GMs being eager to say, "Aw, shucks, guys, I'm not that special, anyone could do what I do, and let's try to nail down what that is!"  Instead good immersive GMing is viewed as a very personal sort of creative expression, or as a level of mastery never to be approached without years of honing the craft, or as a closed club reserved for those who host the sessions and pay the money for the books, etc.<br/><br/>Or maybe it's not about any sort of elitism; maybe it's just hard to imagine another GM using my GMing techniques.  It's true that different GMs foster immersion in different ways.  Some, it's with intense acting.  Others, with prepping the play space.  Others, by handling all of the mechanics and work so the players can just stay in character.  You can't reasonably ask those three GMs to just trade places; maybe the mechanics-handler sucks at acting and finds room prep a chore.  Starting with that take on things, it's easy to give up the analysis before we ever get to a lot of the key techniques, like how we establish when the fiction should and shouldn't require a skill check</blockquote>\nHere's the thing about people learning to GM.

My experience has been that, no matter how deep my knowledge is of a particular system's best practices and mechanics, it is often verboten for me to chime in with any of that. Once or twice I've been in situations where it was explicitly my job to both play my character and help the GM with mechanics. I'm perfectly capable of doing that without cheesing, i.e., using my knowledge of the rules to gain some sort of unfair advantage.

Mind you, the author often does not run her own game, and the most popular can have ten simultaneous runs (or more). We also don't play in open spaces (the lack of privacy would seriously cut down on the intensity of the game).<br/>There are, in a day, three different timeslots. In the morning you have your 4-6 our slots, midday is the novella slot of 2 hours, and evening, beginning at 8, can run as long as people can stay awake. It's rare these days, but prviously it wasn't uncommon to play from 8pm until the morning slot started at 10am. Especially one author was notorious, and his games had to be severely edited by the gm, or it could run continuosly for three days.<br/>To sum up, 1\xbd-2 hours for novellas, 3-6 hours for long-form one-shots. <br/>Many of them from later years are available for free at alexandria.dk<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol" title="Jonathan Nicol"><img alt="Jonathan Nicol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol">Jonathan Nicol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460844/#Comment_460844" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T02:14:22+00:00" title="March  3, 2017  2:14AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am going to admit something here. When I started playing roleplaying games there was no real magic feeling for me. I enjoyed my experiences, but it was not in any way a transformative or immersive experience. I enjoyed and still enjoy playing video games and watching movies as much as I enjoy roleplaying games. <br/><br/>There was tremendous promise as a creative outlet, but I never really saw that potential manifest until I was well into my late 20s. In my youth, playing games like AD&amp;D 2e, Vampire, and Exalted, we were always going for this epic story that never quite manifested. It wasn't until I played Apocalypse World for the first time and really learned to play to find out that I got any real emotional immersion out of gaming. <br/><br/>I stayed in the indie scene for awhile. I mean I still played some more traditional games with friends, more for the company and good old games fun, but the actual roleplaying never quite felt right. In the last couple years I've branched out somewhat. I have learned to appreciate OSR style sandbox play in games like Stars Without Number and Godbound, and got a lot of traction utilizing the techniques I picked up from Apocalypse World to run a couple Chronicles of Darkness games that were really satisfying. <br/><br/>I'm even playing in a Vampire - The Masquerade game right now with a great group of people. The actual game is still not much fun to interact with, but I deal. I try to push hard and play my PC like a stolen car, and that sometimes leads to a bit of conflict. Then I back down. It's still a lot of fun even if I sometimes can see the tracks. It's just not like emotionally satisfying, but not everything worth doing needs to be. I enjoy adding color, addressing interpersonal stuff, and the like even if the stakes aren't being laid bare in the way I would like them to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460848/#Comment_460848" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T05:26:38+00:00" title="March  3, 2017  5:26AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting observations, Jonathan!<br/><br/>What do you think made such a difference for you in the Apocalypse World game?

Also because going from my first college to my second (I transferred), the gaming scene was soooooo much better at the second, that even the myriad problems it still had seemed at least at first to confirm my dreams. In actual practice many of the most fun games I played in college (my second college, that is) were one-shots, LARPs, and one really remarkable campaign\u2014much of the rest was pretty terrible, especially in hindsight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol" title="Jonathan Nicol"><img alt="Jonathan Nicol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol">Jonathan Nicol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460856/#Comment_460856" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T10:27:55+00:00" title="March  3, 2017 10:27AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not entirely sure. Some of it is definitely play culture and people, some of it is setting and pop culture capstones, and a good deal of it is probably system in the way I now understand it. I do think the three are somewhat related.<br/><br/>I grew up in a really small town. There was one gaming group I knew of, and I was in it. We all came together in 1997 when I was in the 7th grade primarily because of our interest in video games, computer programming, graphic design, band, and drama club. It was full on nerd culture. Common cultural capstones included Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 7, Legacy of Kain, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Lord of Rings, Dragonlance novels, Forgotten Realms novels, Wheel of Time, Everquest, classical music, and eventually Anne Rice novels.<br/><br/>I was always something of the odd man out in our group from the beginning. I was somewhat into that stuff, especially the programming and systems analysis stuff, graphic design, and drama club. I liked video games and fantasy novels, but largely different ones. I was into music, but different types. I was all Marvel while the other guys were more into DC. I was a Elric, Conan, Dune, Lovecraft, Quake, Half-Life, Thief, World of Warcraft, Fight Club, Mad Max, Escape From Los Angeles, Predator, Daredevil, Spider Man, New Mutants, Spawn, Slayer, Pantera kind of kid. I also played football and wrestled. We'll get back to that - it definitely played a role in my social currency with the group.<br/><br/>So back to gaming. We all decided we should play some AD&amp;D, but only one of had even played before. Initially our DM was this high schooler who had mad love for Dragonlance. So we played through The Modules. Most of us played a good deal of Final Fantasy so the play style kind of fit like a glove. From the beginning that glove was too tight for me. The Player's Handbook had this Conan looking dude, so obviously I wanted to play basically Conan - Gromar, TN Fighter. I ended up rolling pretty high on Strength, Constitution, and Charisma. Low on Wisdom. Thus a type was born.<br/><br/>Pretty early into the game I had a formative experience. There was a group of monstrous humanoids we encountered that *The Module* said we were supposed to fight. Channeling Robert E. Howard, I was all like these dudes haven't done something to us - can we find out what they want? The other players were all like that's not what the story is about. I was shut down. Everyone else wanted this epic quest, and I just wanted to play my character, take risks, and stuff. I could start to see the rails, and almost took it as a personal challenge to derail the train from there. Later in that same session we were fighting something else *we were supposed to fight* and I took the brunt of the assault and was really low on hit points. The dudes just started missing while the DM rolled from behind the screen. Thus begun the summer of my discontent.<br/><br/>I'll have more later.

Nice to meet you.\n<blockquote>I was all like these dudes haven't done something to us - can we find out what they want? The other players were all like that's not what the story is about. I was shut down. Everyone else wanted this epic quest, and I just wanted to play my character, take risks, and stuff. I could start to see the rails, and almost took it as a personal challenge to derail the train from there.</blockquote>Yeah.  So much of my '90s roleplaying consisted of making cool characters with all this background color and input informing nifty personalities we were eager to portray and explore, and then going on quests which were completely indifferent to such things.  We pegged railroading as a problem early on, but for completely different reasons -- seeing the GM rig things ruined our immersion, that was what we said.  In retrospect it was more about floundering for agency.  <br/><br/>Mostly we just wanted an unbiased arena in which to flex our wits against fair challenges.  But the "What would happen?" ethos definitely extended out into character behavior too.  Whenever there was a tension between "the fun the GM's prepared to support" and "what my character would (<i>actually</i>, not just as player defiance) do", that was a bad scene.  <br/><br/>Eventually we solved it via the original "play to find out", sandboxing.  Not quite an Apocalypse World level of friendliness to individual character exploration, as we kept the Adventuring Party model, but plenty good enough for our needs at the time.

It can be a natural enough progression for some.<br/><br/>For me/us, it was unsatisfactory because we couldn't quite figure out what the GM did to interact with that: the GM tools never quite came together. It was always teetering over one edge or another: too much GM input, and it feels too railroady... too little, and it's aimless and boring... too generic, and it doesn't engage with the characters at all.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460896/#Comment_460896" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T04:00:19+00:00" title="March  4, 2017  4:00AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Veering back toward the original thread topic for a sec, I will note that, whatever hitches we encountered, there was always enough of that childlike magic in a session to keep us coming back for more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460902/#Comment_460902" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T15:15:18+00:00" title="March  4, 2017  3:15PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Veering back toward the original thread topic for a sec, I will note that, whatever hitches we encountered, there was always enough of that childlike magic in a session to keep us coming back for more.</blockquote>\nI think it goes in opposite directions for kids and adults, although I mean that in a positive sense for both.<br/><br/>For kids, it lets them transition to more adult things, games, mastery, showing off proficiency. <br/><br/>For adults, it lets them stop having everything be terribly responsible for a while, and use all of those great "small" skills they have without having to justify those things or have them co-opted to very adult goals like money and status.<br/><br/>IOW, like pizza, even when it's meh, t's still pretty good.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460906/#Comment_460906" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T16:16:58+00:00" title="March  4, 2017  4:16PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hadn't thought of that.
