You have some vague idea of the fiction in your mind, lots of details have been left vague in the actual "shared fiction" (what everybody has actually said to each other). Then somebody else declares something in the fiction - maybe one of those details is fleshed out, or something new appears, or events unfold. And you have to adjust the fiction in your mind to accommodate the new stuff. And hopefully, something clicks and your brain spawns wholely new ideas you didn't think were possible before.

Each of those around the table have their own individual IS, where it overlaps but not between all is "partially SIS" and where all Players (including GM as Player just with different role/authority) overlap is "full SIS". (I debated "personal IS" but the acronym for that would a bit distracting/denigrating).<br/><br/>Such as, from above about clashes, a good game design/good player/good GM all work to prevent individual IS and partial SIS from becoming sources of disjunction/unfun in play and to resolve clashes.<br/><br/>For example, in GMing a game for years that included spending time via email and message boards catering to individual players with "1 on 1" dialogues (Partial SIS) as much as they've wanted, I've decided that I don't want that anymore.  That all the effort creating 1 on 1 dialogue does not yield as much "payback" as it would if shared and encourages "play to be directed away from the group".  It saps the time I as GM have for collective play activity and it directs individual Player energy into "self-satisfying" rather than "mutually satisfying" activity.<br/><br/>In a recent session of more free form play, several players authored activities for others to witness that revealed bits of personality often part of the 1 on 1 between Player and I that collective play hadn't shown.  In several cases this was found greatly entertaining and informing of character by others.  Aspects of individual PC's that had been "Partial SIS" now moved into SIS.  The creativity of each of those players yielded more enjoyment (for other players not just GM) and was riffed off between them and interwoven easily.  It has meant "corrections" in Player perceptions of different characters (e.g., character seen mostly as intolerant and annoying by others is seen as self-sacrificing and enduring social difficulties stoicly when the Player's "individual IS" was shared more fully).<br/><br/>I've decided I should move away from catering as GM to 1:1 activity at all precisely because it's "Partial SIS" and does create situations where one Player and I as GM are seeing, and thus reacting, to something differently than others around table.<br/><br/>The concept of SIS was not pivotal in my sorting through this but it was useful.<br/><br/>The assumption I arrive at is thus that SIS is useful, valid concept, and that its value is in encouraging Players (including GM) to push imaginings into SIS rather than leave them Individual or Partial.  This seems a valuable concept given the frequency with which it seems there is imagining that is important, that matters to play and that is not in SIS.  If others have seen better play from doing otherwise (not pushing imagining into SIS), that would be interesting to hear about, or play where the concept was irrelevant, that too would be interesting.<br/><br/>I thus nominate SIS for the status of "Super Cow", but it doubtless has further ordeal to undergo before it may don its cape and tights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110986/#Comment_110986" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T16:56:50+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  4:56PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>I don't think there's a cow here to kill, guys.</blockquote>\nI'm pretty sure I've seen the beast - the assumption that "what's in my head" is actually the same as "what's in your head", sitting their, unquestioned, eatin' grass.<br/><br/>If I say "You see a cow in a field" and there isn't a "cow" or a "field" in your head, then I have no idea what we're doing, and we don't have an SIS going on.

When the wrong things follow from something, then that thing is screwed up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111081/#Comment_111081" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T04:39:07+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  4:39AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a game called "Through the Ansible" (playtest thread <a>here</a>, rules (kinda) <a href="http://simon.byethost33.com/Ansible/" rel="nofollow">here</a>) as a kind of meditation on the concept of Shared Imagined Space.  In the game, there's no authority over the text, so anything written is not neccesarily "true".  It kind of deconstructs the notion of a shared story, instead making the game about each player constructing a story out of the text.  It also kind of implies that exerting authority over the text is a kind of violence.  <br/><br/>I guess I think SIS is a pretty compromised, and very useful concept.  The sacred cow here, I think, is the notion that the SIS is the entirety, or the "authoratative version" of what happened in play.  Maybe the sacred cow is that there needs to be a consensus among players about "what really happened".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111097/#Comment_111097" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T07:08:30+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  7:08AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>That'd be until I want to turn the cow's hide into a coat to match by black and white pants or I make any other assertion about the cow that was considered trivial until I brought it up.</blockquote>That's when that assertion becomes shared. Then it is contested, and everybody else has to accept or refuse it. Up until then, it is <b>irrelevant</b> to everyone except the individual. Yes, this can be a problem in play. Indeed, this is typically why we have most of the system weight we have - in order to either minimize these "refocus" moments <i>a priori</i> by explicitly limiting and defining what is "legal" to introduce, or to swiftly and smoothly resolve the differences in personal imagination (the "roleplaying") when they become relevant to the shared, social activity that is the "game."<br/><br/>It's practically definitional for the form that this gap exists between shared/public/social creative content and internal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111099/#Comment_111099" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T07:26:51+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  7:26AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2007 7:30AM by Calvino.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we have to get rid of the notion of a Shared Imagined Space, but what we <i>do</i> have to do is make clear exactly what it is and, more importantly, how it comes to be.<br/><br/>The way I see it, all human interaction is, in some manner or other, the creation of Shared Imagined Spaces. All social activity entails the manipulation of signs and, consequently, the negotiation of meaning. This, I believe, is where we must begin our search for the ontogeny of the SIS: in the ways meaning is negotiated among people. Roleplaying is a semiotic system. Players agree upon a code which relates certain objects and events in the real world to certain fictitious objects and events \u2014 for instance, when I say "my guy stabs the orc", this is interpreted as signifying the fictive event of my guy stabbing the orc \u2014 but like all codes, it is imperfect. Just like people in their everyday use of language must continually negotiate how the code is employed \u2014 "What do you mean by saying that?", "How do you define that word?", "It's a figure of speech", "it was a rethorical question", "I didn't mean it like that" \u2014 so, too, must roleplayers continually negotiate how their code is used to signify the fictive events of the gaming narrative.<br/><br/>If there is an SIS, it can only come into existence through such a process of negotiated interpretation. The problem arises, however, that we can never be sure that the imagined space is <i>really</i> shared, because the only way that we can get information about what goes on in the other players' heads is through the very code whose interpretation is at issue: if the negotiation fails, we might never know. Thus, if the SIS is to be considered the result of a successfully negotiated interpretation, we can never really <i>know</i> whether there's really an SIS \u2014 we can only be more or less certain. However, the same problem exists in everyday language use: we can never really be sure that people understand us. And yet we labor under the assumption that they do, because things would get so messy otherwise. The same goes for role-playing: just because we can never be sure that the Imagined Space is really Shared, we shouldn't get rid of the notion, because it is a useful one.<br/><br/>/Kalle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111124/#Comment_111124" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T10:36:43+00:00" title="December  2, 2007 10:36AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *applause*<br/><br/>Kalle is on the nose, as far as I'm concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111173/#Comment_111173" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T15:35:32+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  3:35PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>*applause*</blockquote>\nAw, shucks. *Blushes*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111257/#Comment_111257" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T06:10:49+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  6:10AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like others, I don't think I've ever seen the cow "there is only SIS;
