Once you have a core group of people you can structure the rest of your event around that, and then draw in more volunteers as you go. This group should include one or more dedicated organizers to pull everything together and a team of hosts who are essential for greeting players and funneling them into games.<br/><br/>The next thing you need is the cooperation of the convention staff\u2014usually the gaming event organizer. At the very least, you need for them to provide you with a gaming space (tables, chairs, a host table, etc.). Depending on the convention, they may offer free badges for running games, and possibly other perks (free hotel rooms, etc.). Anything you can get them to offer will help you recruit volunteers.<br/><br/>You'll want to think about the focus of your event\u2014the usual GoD event is tabletop RPG focused, with a strong emphasis on small press and independent games. Outside of that, the games that are run are determined by what the GMs want to offer, and what the players opt to play from that selection.<br/><br/>You may want to find out which retailers and/or publishers will be selling those games at the show and see about coordinating a connection between their efforts and your own. I like to be able to point excited players to the booths where they can buy the games, and likewise have the retailers tell them where GoD is so they can try the games out.<br/><br/>This last bit points at the final issue, which is letting people know where you are and what you're doing. We've begun to build some momentum at shows like Gen Con, Origins, and PAX, which means that returning attendees know to look for us. At the start, however, we tried to get the word out by creating flyers and distributing them to the retailers and convention staff. We've also used volunteer contributions to print up banners so that players can find and identify us in the sea of tables.<br/><br/>I hope that's helpful. Let me know if you have other more specific questions!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413784/#Comment_413784" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-08T14:55:37+00:00" title="May  8, 2013  2:55PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2013 4:11PM by catty_big.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">@Steve_Segedy</a> Apologies for not replying to this much sooner- I\u2019ve had some RL shit, \u2019nuff said. Anyway, here are my comments:\n<blockquote>The first and most important thing you need is a body of enthusiastic volunteers to run games.  This group should include one or more dedicated organizers to pull everything together and a team of hosts who are essential for greeting players and funneling them into games.</blockquote>\nThis has been hard, but we\u2019ve now got a solid five people including me. One problem is that UK Games Expo is more of a boardgame than an RPG one-meaning that it\u2019s not on a lot of indie RPers\u2019 radars- and the emphasis has traditionally been on trad games like CoC and Traveller etc. We have an excellent organiser in the person of Epistolary Richard of this and other parishes, who is doing a <i>superb</i> job at the same time as having a busy workload in his RL job, so massive kudos to him, and the facilitators we have are very committed to making it work.\n<blockquote>The next thing you need is the cooperation of the convention staff\u2014usually the gaming event organizer. At the very least, you need for them to provide you with a gaming space (tables, chairs, a host table, etc.).</blockquote>Co-operation has been grudging at best, mainly I think because of the emphasis on trad games I mentioned above, but also because it\u2019s a ticketed event, unlike at the other cons here in the UK that indie games typically get run at, so they are understandably worried about customer expectations. However, we\u2019re obviously going to do our best with what we\u2019ve been given.\n<blockquote>You'll want to think about the focus of your event\u2014the usual GoD event is tabletop RPG focused, with a strong emphasis on small press and independent games.</blockquote>\n<i>Ooh</i> yeah, you betcha. It\u2019s gonna be dirty hippy all the way- I\u2019m sure the halls will soon echo with the blood-curdling screams of all the Pathfinder players who have wandered in by mistake.\n<blockquote>You may want to find out which retailers and/or publishers will be selling those games at the show and see about coordinating a connection between their efforts and your own.</blockquote>\nHm.. don\u2019t think we\u2019ve thought of that. But yeah, easy enough to arrange. \n<blockquote>I hope that's helpful.</blockquote>\nYes, it was! Thanks!!

Games that have a strong visual presence on the table (<i>Dread</i>, <i> Fiasco</i>, others) will catch the attention of board and card game players.<br/><br/>Another tip is to be conservative about your goals and the number of tables you can fill. It's better to have a few, full tables and extra GMs working as hosts (or even playing in games) than to have lots of tables left empty, or worse, being taken over by squatters. <br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414414/#Comment_414414" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T18:45:46+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  6:45PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2013 6:46PM by catty_big.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many thanks. Regarding games being offered, we are to a large extent constrained by the available GMs and the games they tend to run. That said, we do have a quite a good representative selection, which can seen in <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/thread/972993/indie-games-on-demand-at-uk-games-expo" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on RPGGeek. It includes games of the kind you mention, such as Fiasco, although not so many with hooks for the more trad gamer, but I'm hopeful we can attract some.<br/><br/>Regarding the number of tables, this is in the gift of the organisers, and I imagine it will be impacted by both the size of the room they've allocated to us and the number of sign-ups, which probably won't be high. I reckon we'll have about four or five tables in each slot; in any case, even if we reach only a small number of attenders, opening their eyes to the world of indie gaming, it'll be a start <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>I'll report back after the event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414459/#Comment_414459" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T10:20:26+00:00" title="May 21, 2013 10:20AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somebody is actually running Fat Man Down at the UK Games Expo?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414486/#Comment_414486" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T17:15:19+00:00" title="May 21, 2013  5:15PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2013 5:57PM by catty_big.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Somebody is actually running Fat Man Down at the UK Games Expo?</blockquote>\nYeah, I was surprised too. I'd be very surprised if it got any sign-ups, but in general, regarding the games offered, there are one or two GMs whose trademark style is to run games that are a <i>weeny </i>bit out there. In fact I think I know who that is in this case, although we haven't met collectively to discuss who's running what, so I don't know for definite. I'm offering MLwM, Dog Eat Dog, Microscope, DRYH and Witch:tRtL. It's anybody's guess whether any of the games will get sign-ups, frankly, but we shall see. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
