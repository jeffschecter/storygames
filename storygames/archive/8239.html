Or the fact that our abandonment of Vietnam paved the way for Saddam, Milosevic, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Darfur - 9/11, 7/7, Spain, and now Mumbai - among many many other, but less publicized ones.<br/><br/>Real Liberalism (a Liberalism that was willing to fight for the future of the world and the less fortunate) died in Spain April 1st, 1939. It outlived only just the beginning of the world of modern "Liberals" that began September 30th, 1938 at 10 Downing Street - a world of appeasement, of isolationism, of cowardice, and most of all, hypocrisy.<br/><br/>The sickness of our society is epitomized by the big, black shrine to deaths made meaningless by that hypocrisy that occupies the center of both our national Capitol and our national psyche - and that symbolizes the emptiness of our morality.<br/><br/>And it's no coincidence that this is rap - the Black political movement have been the worst hypocrites of all.<br/><br/>What goes by the name of Liberalism today is just a sick, self-centered hypocrisy that will sacrifice any number of innocents in order to maintain its pathetic fantasy world of politics by rock concert, t-shirt, and bumper sticker - a politics with a soon-to-be leader who is nothing more than a vacuous sound-bite wrapped in feel-good cliches. And a "leader" who is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proud</span> of the fact not only that he plans to make meaningless all of the American lives lost in the Middle East, but also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proud</span> of the fact that he would have sacrificed the Iraqis to life of genocide and repression under Saddam then sacrificed them to a life of chaos and terror after the Liberation he opposed, and will soon state <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proudly</span> that he will sacrifice the Afghanis the same way.<br/><br/>We don't need an rpg on this. We're doomed to living it - and slowly dying as a culture because of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181467/#Comment_181467" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T06:43:06+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  6:43AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181493/#Comment_181493" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T08:49:38+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  8:49AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How convientiant that your example of real liberalism is some odd 70 years gone, thanks alot for telling us the truth. <br/><br/>You know harold and kumar may not have been the best movie in the world, but I think it had a real nugget of truth in it. <br/><br/>"Do you like receiving head, Yes, Do you like giving head, No" <br/><br/>Well there you go your a hypocrite. <br/><br/>I think if you asked the vietnamese who they wanted killing and committing genocide in their country the answer probably would have been no one. You see the biggest problem i have with your ill timed rant, is rather that, if our morality is so empty , why does no one give a shit. I mean honestly <br/><br/>If there is moral values, guaranteed by something other than consensus. <br/><br/>Those values ought to be discernible<br/><br/>and IF those values are discernible<br/><br/>We all ought to be outraged like you. <br/><br/>We are not all outraged like you<br/><br/>Either moral values are not discernible or they are not guaranteed. <br/><br/>short story, Liberterianism is not Liberationism                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181497/#Comment_181497" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T08:58:48+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  8:58AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sink this shit already.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181548/#Comment_181548" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T11:43:03+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 11:43AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2008 11:44AM by Andy.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh.
