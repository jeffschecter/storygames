One difference is editability \xe2\u20ac\u201d in most media, you can edit the story during the creative process. A director can reshoot scenes as many times as he likes. A writer can continuously go back to older chapters, rewriting them, restructuring the plot. However, in roleplaying, once something is established in the narrative, it kind of has "already happened".<br/><br/>Of course, this is not an absolute rule. People always go back, changing small details that happened a short time ago. Polaris, for instance, has even formalized the process in its Key Phrases, which effectively allow you to say "none of that happened". But what if one where to take it a step further, and use editing of scenes, not as a patch to take care of mistakes, but as a technique to enhance the narrative and the gaming experience?<br/><br/>I can imagine several varieties of this technique. The simplest one would be <i>pure editing</i>, wherein you play a scene several times, each time slightly different, decide upon one of the results (through a vote, perhaps), and makes that the "official" version of what happened. Such a technique might tie in to the general scene framing system of the game, and might allow players to request replayings under certain circumstances \xe2\u20ac\u201d or maybe "replay" could be one possible result of conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Taking the idea a step further, one could use replaying in order, not to perfect a scene, but to explore it. One could for instance play the scene from different perspectives, or focusing on different things, or slightly changing the premises each time. In this approach, there would be no need to decide upon an official version (although it would still be possible): if events unfold in a different manner in the different scenes, this might be taken as the subjective experiences of the characters involved \xe2\u20ac\u201d and might lead to an interesting exploration of the border between subjective and objective reality. <br/><br/>Well, these are two ideas, but it feels like I've only scratched the surface. What are your thoughts? Anyone used this technique, and what for? Anyone got other ideas for possible usages?<br/><br/>/Kalle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104519/#Comment_104519" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T06:08:27+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  6:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We talked about replay and editing in another thread that Emily started recently (and that I can't find).  I like the idea very much.  I think with replaying a scene, you'd need to change the point of view or agenda to keep it interesting - replaying subtle variations strikes me as a "perfect is the enemy of good enough" situation, and also potentially tedious.  <br/><br/>If characters had prominent traits that reflected how they were perceived, and others that reflected how they perceived themselves, you'd be able to have amusing dichotomies by simply changing point of view.  To others, I'm an overbearing fop, but to myself, I'm a concerned gentleman.  Play the scene from both points of view, maybe with entirely different outcomes, and then have some mechanism for choosing which becomes accepted.  For a humorous game, reinforce the future power of the trait that <i>isn't </i>selected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104521/#Comment_104521" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T06:23:28+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  6:23AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason: Oh yeah, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4596&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">here it is</a>. Thanks.<br/><br/>I agree with your concern about tediousness. It would of course be important to make sure that the replay was <i>meaningful</i>, that there was a dichotomy between the different versions of a scene off of which you could jam. The difference should have a meaning, whether in the narrative or on the meta-level. Otherwise, it would just be a waste of time.<br/><br/>/Kalle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104678/#Comment_104678" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T22:03:16+00:00" title="October 24, 2007 10:03PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the other <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4596" rel="nofollow">thread</a>.

But the different perspectives really would have to differ in important ways in order for it to matter. <br/><br/>Part of the reason I asked about it is because I've seen it done in improvisational games, where people took a given situation and replayed it, changing the game dramatically. It gave the person a chance to take back what they saw as a weaker contribution and give something else that had a much stronger impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104984/#Comment_104984" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T09:14:44+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  9:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted ideas for an Over the Edge hack that centered on replaying scenes here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://yurugames.blogspot.com/2005/11/over-edge-variant-rules.html" rel="nofollow">Over the Edge variant</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105028/#Comment_105028" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T12:39:34+00:00" title="October 26, 2007 12:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily: Yeah, cool.

If the played out scene fails to meet the constraint, it must be redone. In my session it occurred once: When the heros best buddy got shot and dies in the arms of the hero. In this case it helped make a grotesque, prolonged death scene.

There's some skill in identifying the sweet spot so that it doesn't become interminable, and the scene feels natural within the constraint, but that's just a design challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105458/#Comment_105458" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T20:56:39+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  8:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Calvino</cite>Emily: Yeah, cool.

Actually got to run Doubt this weekend, and we had one scene that got re-played.  A main player in it wasn't satisfied with it, so we suggested doing it again. But others like what it had revealed about the characters, so another player suggested we consider this a wish of how the situation had gone by the main character.  That felt good. Dream and reality, right on for the game. <br/><br/>And as for it being a jeep form technique...yes it is in their tool box. I know one jeepster who is fond of it, and another recommended it at various points.  But they don't have a corner on it, I am sure. <br/><br/>(Oh, hallelujah, my computer can read the formatting of this forum again.
