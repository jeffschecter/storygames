It is still far from certain that you will reach your destination. Many of your exiled brothers and sisters have perished on the way, from hunger or exhaustion or in the jaws of predators roaming the wilds. And for you there is yet another cause for concern \u2013 some of your companions claim to hear a whispering voice in the gusts of snowy mountain air!<br/><br/>Symbaroum is a Swedish fantasy role-playing game by J\xe4rnringen, recently translated into English, and distributed by Modiphius in the UK. Players take on character roles in a setting of somewhat grim fantasy, not too dissimilar to that of the likes of Warhammer's Old World or Leiber's Lankhmar. The adventure is based on - but not a simple run-through - of the adventure included in the core book.<br/><br/>GM: Paul Baldowski<br/>Players: Up to 5<br/>Slot: Morning<br/><br/><b>Dark Predators</b><br/>The City - where all that is left of humanity live out their lives in a technological paradise. But is it an Arc or is it a Trap? Surrounded by a wilderness fully of gigantic natural monstrosities, and defended by giant Mecha, The City is all that you have ever known. But is it the perfect world you were led to believe?<br/><br/>High octane Sci Fi action Anime adventure in the same vein as Akira, The Ghost in The Shell, Appleseed and Robotech. In a dystopian future arcology, street brats discover a terrible conspiracy. Anime, Henshin Heroes, Kaiju and Mecha. It's Morphin' Time!<br/><br/>This is my only game to use a slightly different system, my forthcoming The Code of Sh\u014djo and Sh\u014dnen - the fourth in my series of popular "Code" books. Lightweight, 2d6 roleplaying. Similar to Manifold but more genre specific, lightweight and faster to play with a more narrative approach.<br/><br/>GM: Simon Burley<br/>Players: 3-5<br/>Slot: Morning<br/><br/><b>Deadpool Saves the Fantastic Four</b><br/>WARNING: this blurb may contain adult content.<br/><br/>When you've a face which looks like an rotten avocado had sex with an even more rotten avocado and your girl can't look at you whilst doing the dirty - even after downing a bottle of vodka - you tend to clutch at straws. So Wade Wilson turns to famed scientist Reed Richards for help.<br/><br/>Discredited after four failed films (the Corman one counts) the ex-Mr Fantastic and his so-called "Fantastic" Four have holed-up in the Baxter Building - so at least they're easy to find. Except, when Deadpool gets there, all he finds is a Police Cordon and a crater in the ground.<br/><br/>Checking his ammo bag - yup, they've got a MUCH bigger budget this time around - he leaps into the hole to investigate......<br/><br/>Using my easy-play cinematic Manifold rules, you'll play Deadpool or a member of the CLASSIC Fantastic Four. It'll probably go gonzo pretty quick - with the person who tells the grossest dirty joke being allowed to play the "Merc with the Mouth" - and if you want to create alternative characters from the stories (Medusa, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Herbie the Robot etc), I'll let you.<br/><br/>Repeated gross-out Adult humour mandatory. 18+ at the table and at any table within earshot.<br/><br/>GM: Simon Burley<br/>Players: 3-5 (but I'll sulk if I don't get 5)<br/>Slot: Afternoon <br/><br/><b>Flight into Oblivion</b><br/>You're on the cheap overnight flight back from New York to the UK - you know, the one where the night only lasts about 2 hours - when things take a turn to the bizarre.....<br/><br/>A low budget mystery/horror film - probably a student film made on that aeroplane standing set some film colleges have, with airport scenes and special effects cut in later when they've got a budget - along the lines of The Langoliers, The Ninth Gate, Source Code and Constantine.<br/><br/>Using my easy-play cinematic Manifold rules. Can you work out what's going on before your time is up? <br/><br/>Flight into Oblivion is a scenario of mystery and horror. It will last exactly two and a half hours \u2013 to allow me to run for my train \u2013 making it ideal for those who \u2013 like me \u2013 have to leave early.
