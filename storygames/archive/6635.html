I look for loose floorboards" "I check the lighting fixtures" etc...<br/><br/>what I've seen more and more can be:<br/><br/>    "I take 20 on a search check what do I find?" That's it...<br/><br/><br/>You could have a whole sequence to enjoy role-playing and player idea creation rather than mostly a fast-forward of Player-GM negotiation and It's over in 5 minutes with one skill check. Now this may not sound like fun to some people (hence the "clashing playstyles")  but the fact remains that some players' fun may be stepped on my anothers playstyle simply because it's "in the rules" to allow for it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Another thought...<br/>When is "skipping ahead"  or  "fast forwarding"  to get past the "boring parts"  or  rather to avoid the challenge of role-playing for fear that your words may not be as "effective" as your die roll?<br/>...<br/>Me... I tend to feel that any question or discussion of importance to the plot  (be they:   main, sub or personal PC plot)  should  always be played through with role-playing rather than just skimmed over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This happened recently in our Exalted game.<br/>Not specifically the same, but similar...  Our PC group had just interrogated and turned an NPC to help the group.  He had a second accomplice.  We then needed to go through a "similar conversation" with this next NPC.  Some were in favor of just skipping ahead, saying we "say the same stuff",  while others were in favor of playing...  since the stuff we would be doing wouldn't be the same exactly since we'd taken a couple hours to go through the original conversation  and  the fact that it was a different person, who would likely have different responses.<br/>And frankly - this WAS "role-playing", which is the entire point...<br/><br/>I'm (personally)  torn with this idea.  I understand the want to move on to the next big event  or  the want to do more cool role-play  as well as the worry that we might role-play and say something wrong that will cause problems with this second interrogation...<br/><br/>Then again - back to the original thought -  is this also "short circuiting" an encounter?<br/><br/><br/><br/>I think the theory of this is facinating...<br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>thanks!<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147218/#Comment_147218" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T02:48:11+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  2:48AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't say roleplaying is the entire point. I'd say fun is.<br/><br/>If the most fun path through a game means avoiding any roleplay, then your using the wrong game (if you do want to do roleplaying). Taking the most fun path in the game and roleplaying should go together. If their not, wrong game to use if you do want to roleplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147241/#Comment_147241" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T07:00:58+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  7:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Usually when someone talks about "I search under the bed...okay, under the desk....behind the curtain?", they call it pixelbitching.  It's like playing twenty questions with someone, only you don't know how many questions you're going to get.  ("You said you wanted to check behind the curtain, not that you wanted to check <i>on the back of</i> the curtain").  So maybe that wasn't the best example to bring out for this one.<br/><br/>You pretty much nailed it when you said that mostly this is a case for clashing playstyles.  It's the same old story -- some dude wants to roleplay going shopping, up to and including making small talk with the guy at the register, another dude keeps looking at his watch and saying "So...can we maybe just say that we buy all the stuff on our shopping list and actually get to <i>do</i> something tonight?"  Figuring out where everyone in the group lies on that scale and trying to keep things in the range where everyone is reasonably satisfied with the level of detail is the trick.<br/><br/>Which is why it's always a good idea to ask people what they want.  More minutiae?  Less?  More when it's showing off in front of an audience and less when it's just one person?  More when it's a recurring NPC, less when it's an NPC who doesn't even have a name?  More when there are two PCs in the same room and less when they're solo?  The only way everyone can figure out where to draw the boundaries is by talking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147294/#Comment_147294" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T11:05:25+00:00" title="June  2, 2008 11:05AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me the main issue for pacing is "who decides?" Various answer to this question have different implications.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. No-one decides. Always go at real-time pace. Like a LARP. This has the advantage of possibly being pro-character-immersive in some circumstances, doesn't require any players to think about the "metagame" and doesn't require any work on the part of the GM. One big problem though is it sometimes results in situations where literally everyone is bored and dissatisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. It's the GM's job. Several recent games I've read (DnD 4ed and SotC) specifically place the pacing task onto the GM. As a player, I've seen the GMs I've played with botch pacing repeatedly. As a GM, being responsible for pacing strikes me as a massive chore and exercise in mind reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. It's the GM's job, but the players can make recommendations to speed up play. As a player, my view here is you might as well give me authority to move the scene forward, rather than making me say "mother may we speed up the pace?" Because now as a player not only am I expected to think about metagame concept of pacing, but I might find myself embroiled in arguments about it if I do bring it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Anyone can fast forward a scene. This is how Polaris handles it. This is currently my preferred solution. Get to things which everyone is interested in, or at least, everyone who is expected to put in large contributions to the gamespace.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The mechanics take care of it automatically, somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147316/#Comment_147316" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T11:58:17+00:00" title="June  2, 2008 11:58AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some random thoughts:<br><br>If two players want different pacing, it is sort of obvious that there will be no automatic solution that does not screw at least one of them.  I think solution 5 becomes a logical impossibility.<br><br>My GM tends to push the pacing a little faster than I like, but I also tend to be a bit of a spotlight hog, so I think it balances out in the end.<br><br>System matters.  If a "take 20" rule is available, players will use it.  If you want a slower paced game, you should choose a system without it, or house rule it away.<br><br>If "anyone can fast forward a scene," I would suspect a systematic bias against those desiring a slower pace.  I haven't played Polaris, so cannot comment on how it ends up working.<br><br>I think leaving it to the GM works well if the GM is good.  If your GM isn't good, you're already screwed.<br/><br/>I can't imagine sticking around in a game where 2 did not imply 3.  A "good" GM pays attention to what the players want.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
