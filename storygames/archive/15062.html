I'll post some actual play reports here, for your perusal and discussion. Any questions or comments, or insightful experiences of your own, will be appreciated.<br/><br/><b>The game; Fabula</b><br/>I'm using the classical fantasy role-playing game <i>Fabula</i> ("classical" = rpg with GM). It's a game in it's ninth edition, but only one of them has been published (1999). The game-method is agile and robust, focusing as much on techniques as on mechanics. It plays faster than the normal classical game; a normal game-session last for 2-2,5 hours. Within that time it is able to deliver a dramatic arc that is both tight and engaging.<br/><br/>The game use a single die (D20), and a single roll against skill produces both success/failure and quality/quantity. So there is little mechanical down-time in this game.<br/><br/>Both GM and players frame scenes. GM set parameters for the scene-framing before a round; in the village; on the road; social scenes; etc. Each player get to frame one scene during a round. The GM may frame follow-up scenes, or free scenes, as many as she find to be right for the game.<br/><br/>Players use their characters as the main dramatic tool, and mainly participate in interaction through character-action/words. The players are 10-15 years old, most of them experienced with <i>Fabula</i>. <br/><br/><b>The setting: Orianna</b><br/><i>Orianna</i> is THE oldest setting for this game; a small kingdom in the outskirts of the known world. But in planning these colonial campaigns, I have reinvented the setting. That is: I have gone back in time, to the era when <i>Orianna</i> was used as a name for the continent, and about to be settled by humans. <br/><br/><i>Orianna</i> is not an empty land; it has peaceful inhabitants, the green-skinned orcs. They live in peaceful tribes, in a land filled with natures bounty. Each tribe is led by a ring of matriarchs, keeping up order and tradition. They are migrating tribes, following the colossal herds of aurochs from the western lowlands to the eastern highlands of the central <i>Orianna</i>. They use bolas and stone-knives to hunt the beasts, and do not know of any war-like weapons.<br/><br/><b>The characters: settlers</b><br/>The player characters will be resourceful settlers, coming to the shores of <i>Orianna</i> with a carefully instilled prejudice against "the beastly orcs". Their aim is to find new lands with lush soil, and to build themselves a new life there, away from the feudal oppression, religious persecution and outright poverty of the olden world.<br/><br/><b>Premise</b><br/>This is the basis for the campaigns. There are more details to it, of course, but this larger picture is what I'm mostly concerned with before the actual game-play commences; it is what I need, to know where to put pressure on the players and make them engage in the theme.<br/><br/>I'm making the orcs into a peaceful people, at the mercy of the player characters if any conflict builds into physical struggle. I'll use the initial stages of the game to paint a disturbing and threatening picture of these "grunting half-beasts", to stage the scene for hard misunderstandings and wanton brutality when the PC's meet the savages.<br/><br/>I'll post actual play reports in this thread, and would be grateful for any discussions or observations springing out of the reports.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342236/#Comment_342236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T10:37:11+00:00" title="September 11, 2011 10:37AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a hoot, do you have a link to the current edition of the Fabula rules?<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_342396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342396/#Comment_342396" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T10:32:44+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 10:32AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2011 12:43PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Todd! <i>Fabula</i> is in Norwegian.<br/><br/>Prepared the games this afternoon, by drawing some varyingly inaccurate maps of Orianna, wich will be "sketched by knowledgeable people" (more or less dependable NPC's). The inaccurate maps are important; they will send some character-groups in "bad" directions, and create tensions in the group of settlers/explorers. The sketches are supplied with the classic "Here be dragons" and similar phrases, to feed the imagination of the players, and to feed the character-talks on what to expect.<br/><br/>The NPC's sketching the maps are key-informants the characters meet on an island off the coast of the new continent.

So we got to play some nice scenes of them exploring the frontier town (both players and GM frame scenes in <i>Fabula</i>). That exploration ended naturally with the characters in audience with the lord, where they asked about where to settle. But the lord demanded a golden crown of each, to let them settle on the island. They said that was too much for them, so they were dismissed, and given a fortnight to come up with the gold, or to sail away.<br/><br/>I set a follow-up scene: Now you sit at a shabby inn; The Bucket. You've just ordered some wash-porridge and "slemme" (water-diluted brew). You overhear some folks talking about the land Orianna; wide and lush, and free from greedy overlords ...<br/>- they proceeded to plan how to get to this new, free land.<br/><br/>The intro worked better with their audience with the lord as an actual scene. It leaves me more to play on, if I want to use the lord in later stages of the game.

They have ownership over their own family as NPCs (they may introduce them in any scenes, but the GM plays them).<br/><br/>We are working mostly to establish some relationships now, based on things they experience together. We make our time doing this, as a relationship between two characters will grow from itself as they get more shared memories. Next session these relationships will start to blossom for real, and from there on that part of interaction is great fun.<br/><br/>The bugged map is working well. The characters/players have followed the map, but really has no clue about where they are. And they know next to nothing about the land. <br/><br/>The herds are of a grand cattle they have never seen before, and lends itself to the strange nature of Orianna. They have realized the potential of hunting (orcs in these lands are peaceful hunter-gatherers), but as they come from lands where only lords were allowed to hunt, they have no skills. One of them is practicing a lot with his bow, though, so they are probably going to develop some hunting skills.<br/>______________________<br/><br/>In my view this is developing the way I envisioned it. I could have done more to "exotifice" the lands, but that is no stress. Small tidbits of "strange" info will do it. Next time I will serve them up a strange "milk-tree", to make the woods a bit strange too. And maybe a fish with wings in the river, jumping the water-falls with great elegance. And that will be more than enough, I believe.<br/><br/>As it is, I believe the players are really taking part of the grand adventure their characters are experiencing. The barn-thing was great, communicating a sense of farmer/settler/frontier-solidarity. <br/><br/>The colonization-theme is a novel path of play for me, and I enjoy it very much.<br/><br/>This afternoon I continue the campaigns with two other groups. I'll post a report of those sessions too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_343985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343985/#Comment_343985" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T00:04:07+00:00" title="September 26, 2011 12:04AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2011 12:09AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>The bugged map is working well.

The boat so full it would sink in a storm. Luck is with them; sailing to <i>Orianna</i> goes without troubles. They even succeed in settling the most favorable spot on the coast.<br/><br/>Fishing is good in the mouth of the great river. The river plains are lush, the wild cattle comes in thousands, and the forests have trees with milk in them (a white, sweet sap, in abundance). They call their settlement for Milk, and praise the holy Hand, which in its infinite wisdom has led them to this paradise.<br/><br/>They are indeed in a favorable spot, having landed far to the south in this lush land, and with no orc dwellings close by. The one thing they need to handle, is the yearly flooding by the great river, on the river plains. <br/><br/><b>The land of Moo</b><br/><i>- game-session last thursday <br/>(second session in campaign)</i><br/><br/>A small band of settlers, no children amongst them, built a boat from the remains of an abandoned inn in the town of <i>Imdoras</i>. They set sail for <i>Orianna</i>, guided by a worthless map, and ended up sailing up and down the coast while debating wether this was or was not the fabled land. <br/><br/>They saw orcs, in boats and on land, and grew increasingly vary of their presence. At last they found the mouth of a small river, by a deep forest, and made their lucky throw there. Building a small cabin to share, they spotted (and heard) lots of wild cattle in the hills, and named their settlement Moo.<br/><br/>The location is good in resources, and they are very enthusiastic about it, but it's a bit close to an orc dwelling ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344067/#Comment_344067" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T22:07:10+00:00" title="September 26, 2011 10:07PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2011 10:08PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I'm going to lead the forth group in their second game-session today.

One of them had a serious accident (dislocated shoulder) and one had the misfortune of falling off the roof, into the sewer pit. The construction went alright. They have a proper longhouse now, as winter is coming.<br/><br/>- One scene had them wakening to sounds outside house, hearing grunting sounds, thinking of orcs immediately, and then one of them was felled in the dark. His hypothesis was; "Those thieving orcs did it, with a stone-axe!" They all agreed on this, and began thinking of "the orc threat" (really; it was a wild boar nosing about, and attacking them in the darkness).<br/><br/>- They wanted to scout the surroundings now, having seen orcs several times during construction and after. "We need to establish where they live, and how many they are". Scouted north, east and south, in several small excursions, and happened upon orcs several times. One small band of orcs were "dressed for war, with face-paintings and feathers" (really; dressed up for flirting in neighboring village). One orc came upon them in the hills, above them, so I stood up on the chair and shouted guttural sounds at them, and behind me, while gesticulating a lot, as the orc. They ran off! All of this made them really nervous, and made them start to think of arming themselves and training for war.<br/><br/>- I reckon the orc-field is ripe for violence next session ...<br/>________________________________________________<br/><br/><i>If you have any comments, thoughts or questions on my experiences so far, with this settlers-style campaign, feel free to post it here.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
