Like a lot of people, when I love a system I want to run things in it. All sorts of things. <i>Every</i> thing. Saying "let's run it in Apocalypse World" becomes a reflex reaction, and the fact that it's so delightfully hackable - as evidenced by Dungeon World, Monsterhearts and all the rest - doesn't do anything to temper that reflex. But my better judgment has to put its foot down eventually and say, "No, this is not a universal system, and you shouldn't treat it like one."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is Apocalypse World <i>for</i>, really? What sorts of themes, situations and people are its mechanics intrisically good at dealing with? By contrast, what doesn't it do well, either at all or without so much hacking that you'd be better off using another game? I've been trying to answer these questions myself, but I've realized that I simply don't have enough Actual Play experience with AW or its offshoots to come to an informed conclusion. I'd love to hear what you folks think. Especially welcome are your AP experiences with Apocalypse World hacks, both positive and negative, and what made them go down the way they did.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379859/#Comment_379859" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T12:20:41+00:00" title="May 27, 2012 12:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have 3-5 sessions each of AW, Dungeon World and The Regiment, and two sessions of Monsterhearts under my belt now. And I've been thinking about this very question. <br><br>My feeling is that AW is best at telling stories at the table that are inherently inward-looking. There may be a goblin or a guy with a wrench or a bully in front of you. But sessions that mostly deal with external threats are not the most satisfying ones in my experience. To me, the game is about what those threats meet to you and the relationships you have with the other PCs. <br/><br/>Dungeon World at the surface may look like the exception. But in reality, it's one of the most inward-looking games. You NEED those other party members around you. Separate for too long and any one character will get their ass kicked. And bear in mind that Dungeon World has had a LOT of work put into it. It may use the core of AW, but it's fully its own game. <br/><br/>Plus, I think the game needs to be "personal" to really work with the AW engine. For example, The Regiment has rules for platoon combat. But honesty, those are the creakiest rules for me because they are getting away from the core of AW that treats a "gang" of say 15-20 individuals like one (powerful) person for combat's sake. Once you are dealing with more than 6-8 individuals it's difficult to give any one screen time. AW gets it right where it just gives NPCs a name, a "job" and some kind of want. And stops there unless and until the NPC justifies it's development more. <br/><br/>So for example, if you wanted to play Cthulhu with AW, I think you would need to modify your expectations to really make it sing. Make it less about the investigations and great external threats. And more how those things are ripping at the relationships between the PCs. <br/><br/>Am I off-base here? What's do others w lots of AW experience think?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379860/#Comment_379860" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T12:44:47+00:00" title="May 27, 2012 12:44PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The inward vs. outward situations thing is exactly how I would describe AW as well: sure, there is stuff going on outside the circle of main characters, but what really makes it compelling is seeing how the PCs deal with those situations as a group.

Don't forget that Murderous Ghosts is an AW hack too, and it does some very different things.<br/><br/>If you take the core of AW as:<br/>- setting expectations<br/>- agendas<br/>- always say<br/>- principles<br/>- moves / stuff that's not moves<br/>- playbooks<br/>- a few other things<br/><br/>That's basically <i>all of roleplaying</i>, so asking what AW is good at and what it can't do seems a bit silly at that point.

You just have to do all the work at the front end that makes possible the thing you want to do.<br/><br/>If you're hacking relatively close to the tree (which Monsterhearts, Dungeon World, Sagas of the Icelanders, and such all do), not straying very far from the core of AW, then you're talking about a much more specific set of things.<br/><br/>I've got a PAX Dev proposal in consideration that examines AW as a "tabletop development framework," but even if it doesn't get approved, I want to give that talk at some point, because -- in essence, and if you step back enough -- AW is a systematic, modular system for designing any game you can imagine, something like a programming language for RPGs (in a way that's much more robust than what Fudge attempted to be, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kestral" title="Kestral"><img alt="Kestral" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kestral">Kestral</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379863/#Comment_379863" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T14:04:02+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  2:04PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2012 2:05PM by Kestral.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I know that the engine is not alone in our story-game nook of fabulous games that do just this, but the rulesets are particularly structured and say <i>'if you play the way the game tells you to, you will co-author suprising and enthralling stories that the whole group can take ownership of and shoulder responsibility for'</i>. More importantly, this structure encourages more play and more sessions to find out what happens (to most folks I've introduced the system to).<br/><br/>MC/GM's get a lovely wake-up call in this engine, codified and laid out bare and simple for all to see. <b>This is what you need to do to run the game and have fun<i></i></b>.

Like when they start they are level 1 and they can wander around the map and discover a challenge that is way beyond them, and then they have to leave and come back later when they are level 10 and it becomes a fair fight? Yeah, AW is pretty crap at doing that. Sure, you get more moves and better stats, but the stat scale is pretty short, and doesn't react well to "challenge levels" and stuff like when you start making certain actions more difficult by adding penalties, and having more moves just gives you more options, as opposed to keeping you relative to a challenge rating. AW is built for a world where everything is generally on the same scale--some people are more skilled than others, but they are all still people, and if the PCs are "heroes" it is by dint of being PCs and the subject of the story.<br/><br/>Also, AW gives very little support for exploration style gaming (where PCs go places that are dangerous and unfamiliar). Sure, Dungeon World sorta focuses on that, but the whole "leave spaces in the map" thing wouldn't go over very well with the people I play D&amp;D with, because they expect all the important things on the map to be set in stone beforehand. Instead, AW gives you lots of support for playing a game in a setting that the characters are already familiar with (because they live there), by telling you (the MC) to ask questions about their characters and their lives, and telling the players that they are responsible for answering those questions.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is best suited to games focused on <b>drama</b>. Situations where PCs inhabit a world they are at least somewhat familiar with and live in, and are constantly interacting with and butting heads with each other and other characters, as well as problems that threaten their way of life and the things they hold dear, are AW's bread and butter.<br/><br/>These interactions, conflicts, and threats also work best when they are clear and in the open, at least in part. AW is not a game that lends itself to stealth and cloak-and-dagger operations. Stories that involve stealth build tension through the threat of discovery, and the conflict in that moment is between the stealthy actor and the difficulty of staying hidden. The AW rules don't really focus on that kind of internal struggle very well, they are meant to focus on an active protagonist versus an external threat. Things really get going in AW at the moment of discovery, not so much before that.<br/><br/>So, like Monsterhearts looks a lot different, because it has totally different moves and it has strings and stuff, but it's still about the same kind of drama as AW. And Dungeon World looks like a dungeoncrawl game, but it takes that focus on drama and switches up to "adventure" instead of going all the way into exploration. In DW the point is to go on an adventure, not to make an unfamiliar environment familiar through exploring it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379877/#Comment_379877" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T18:26:24+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  6:26PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2012 6:27PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>"Seven to Nine is the Heart of what some have termed 'Story Games'."</blockquote>\nThis is also a good point. It's worth noting that all of Vincent's games tend to focus in on the cost of success, or how much will you have to pay to get what you want.<br/><br/>Escalation in Dogs and Poison'd does this, as does Fallout (in Dogs). The main resolution mechanic in Chalk Outlines Waiting to Happen is probably the most explicit implementation of this, where the dice determine how many concessions you have to make in order to succeed at something.<br/><br/>Role-playing games have traditionally gone with a pass/fail resolution mechanic, occasionally with degrees of success. But a 7-9 result on act under fire is an ugly choice, and taking advantage of that choice -- "you can pull him out of the fire, but you'll get burned yourself... you still gonna do it?" --is a really powerful tool (Otherkind Dice is a more complicated version of this).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379878/#Comment_379878" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T18:29:47+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  6:29PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2012 12:15PM by J_Walton.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Matthew, I find myself disagreeing with a lot of this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>Conversely, if you want a game about slow build ups, scheming, intrigues, secrets, strong structures that are not easily toppled, etc., this isn't it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Like when they start they are level 1 and they can wander around the map and discover a challenge that is way beyond them, and then they have to leave and come back later when they are level 10 and it becomes a fair fight? Yeah, AW is pretty crap at doing that.</blockquote>\nAW is all about having the fictional positioning necessary to make moves, right? So it actually handles things that are outside of your PC's scope really well. You just can't make moves against them, because you don't have any leverage over them. Like, in DW, you probably have to do some serious work in order to be able to roll Hack N Slash against a dragon, because they're not vulnerable to the normal weapons or tactics that you're using. This even happens in standard AW with stuff like the Psychic Maelstrom, which you can't normally target with your moves. But if you use +workspace or +augury (moves you only get later in the game), or do something else to get fictional positioning over the Maelstrom, all of a sudden it becomes more possible to target it with moves. It's pretty easy to imagine something similar happening with Corporations in a Shadowrun hack, for example: you can target individual agents but not the Corp as a whole until you can get some fictional positioning that allows you to do so.<br/><br/>+workspace is also a great model for investigation and exploration games, actually. "When you want to get to the bottom of something, tell the MC what you want and they'll tell you what you need to do in order to do that." Perfect.  I'm not sure what else you need.  You could say: "I want to know what happened to the Holmston Expedition and why they never returned." Or "I want to know the spell of power that opens the gateway to the Plane of Fire." Or you could say: "I want to figure out who murdered Jesse Smoulders and find some hard evidence that they did it."  Ideally, in a game that was centered on exploration or investigation, +workspace would just be the beginning of something. Because the GM might say: "Well, you probably need X and Y, but in order to do that, you probably need to talk to someone in the Won Sing Triad. Do you know anyone involved in the Chinatown gangs?" And moves snowball, etc. (both MC and player moves).<br/><br/>I mean, it's easy to be distracted by what the existing AW moves do and how they are arranged, but even core moves are easily hacked or replaced with other moves. What happens when you make something like +workspace or +augury a core move? What if it's something like "An arresting skinner" (i.e. a move that just happens, without rolling)? Those are pretty simple hacks and they completely change the nature and tone of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379880/#Comment_379880" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T19:40:37+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  7:40PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>It's worth noting that all of Vincent's games tend to focus in on the cost of success, or how much will you have to pay to get what you want.</blockquote>\nIt's also worth noting that most of the Story Games I admire \u2013\xa0<i>Steal Away Jordan</i>, <i>Annalise</i>, <i>Shock</i> and others \u2013 do exactly this.<br/><br/><i>Apocalypse World</i> is the elaborate apparatus that woos regular schmuck gamers (including many Story Gamers who thought they were "beyond" being regular schmuck gamers... but weren't) into this line of thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379887/#Comment_379887" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T22:20:35+00:00" title="May 27, 2012 10:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>These interactions, conflicts, and threats also work best when they are clear and in the open, at least in part.

I'm talking about character effectiveness versus variable challenge ratings. The difference between 5 hit points and 50 hit points is not something AW does. It also isn't able to differentiate between obstacles that require different levels of skill. Your examples are all narrative problems that need to be taken care of before dice are even rolled. But the situation where you see an Ob 8 test to break through the Black Gate and you realize your dice pool is nowhere near big enough and you need to increase your skill first (or collect a bunch more artha) is not something that happens in AW. You can always take on any challenge at any time.<br/><br/>Even though you can get new moves and stuff and you can use workspaces for quests and whatnot, AW is more like starting at level 3 and going to level 5, and then picking up the special abilities of other classes, but not their hit dice or attack bonuses. Which isn't to say a lot of that stuff can't be hacked into AW, or that specific parts of AW can't be removed from AW and fit into games that do that style of play, BUT the OP wanted to stay close to the original, so: with AW proper, yes you can have problems that defy certain types of solutions, but there's no place for scalable skill level or effectiveness past that -2 to +3 range, which is pretty tight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379898/#Comment_379898" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T02:34:01+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  2:34AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2012 10:51AM by Rafu.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, things the AW engine definitely <i>cannot</i> do:\n<ol>\n<li>Provide a layer of mechanical challenge to engage (Step On Up against, if that's your purpose) which is sort-of-removed, or partially shielded, from the fiction.

I've been noticing these things too. I'm still fairly new to the game, and it's taking me some time to really, really grok it, but having clear, limited choices in the beginning is great and makes it easier to get right to playing every time.<br/><br/>So here's something Apocalypse World (and certainly also Monsterhearts - I can't speak for other hacks) is intrinsically good at: sex.<br/><br/>I've talked to some people who say that they or their groups don't really engage with the sex moves or do so infrequently. But that seems kind of lame to me. I get that a lot of people (and I've been there too) are uncomfortable with introducing sex to games in an obvious way - there are exceptions, but most people don't want their game to feel like porn or whatever. That's fine - that's actually <i>not</i> what AW world encourages with sex moves. What it encourages is sex that <i>matters</i>.<br/><br/>The game really does this with mechanical reinforcement and by having it front and center on your character sheet. At it's most basic level, sex gives you power over each other. And depending on the skins it may do other things as well. If you actually roleplay mechanical affects (which you should, otherwise the game tends to lose its humanity to a bloodbath), then you and that other person may never look at each other the same again. For better or worse, but something <i>changed</i>. And now you have something on them and they have something on you. And that can effect the outcome of future rolls and most certainly the narrative.<br/><br/>So sex is a <i>thing.</i> And not having sex is a thing too. It's sort of the conceit of the game that your characters are more or less sexy, competent, and passionate. If your character abstains, it should be an interesting intentional choice - maybe even an agonizing one. Maybe The Operator just can't afford to have one more thing to look out for. Or in Monsterhearts, maybe The Infernal still has a conscience and can't bare the thought of letting the Dark Power gain a string on his lover. Interesting, right? <br/><br/>I'll go out on a limb to say that if your AW game does not include sex as a thing (just as if you ignored other Moves, and perhaps more so), you're missing out on something this game was designed to do well.<br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379931/#Comment_379931" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T08:47:47+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  8:47AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: EarthenForge</cite>If your character abstains, it should be an interesting intentional choice</blockquote>\nYes!<br/>I find that even if sex never happens, not once, in an AW campaign, sex is still on our collective radar, as a play group. <br/>This spilled over into playing Sagas of the Icelanders at Camp Nerdly - - since I was playing a shield-maiden, I had the move <i>Lie with a man and become pregnant</i>, which I never used, and yet, whenever I was in a dilemma involving a male adversary, a small part of my brain thought, "Well... you could sleep with him."<br/>I never did it, but I mean, real people think like that!

The fiction. This is the stuff Jonathan Walton mentioned. Difficulty is measured by how easy it is for a character to find the means to do something, which kind of nullifies the point of difficulty. Like when you discover that the psychic maelstrom is being run by a satellite in low Earth orbit -- you have no way to get to that satellite, because you are just people. Maybe you can build a spaceship or discover a space elevator or hack into it's comm link, but until you discover a way to do that in the fiction, it's not <i>difficult</i>, it's <i>impossible</i>. And you need to find those specific solutions in the fiction. It's more like a test of a player's creativity and problem-solving skills, not a test of the character or the player's ability to tactically or strategically manipulate rules.<br/><br/>2. Stats. Like Zac mentioned, this is the basic determinant of how difficult it is to do something. If you have hot-2, good luck talking somebody into doing something. If you have weird+3, the psychic maelstrom is your bitch. But that's a personal scale, it measures how difficult is is for your character to do something, and there's five of them. So you can build up one of your stats over time, and go from a tongue-tied misfit to a suave heartbreaker, but you can't build overall effectiveness like you can in D&amp;D. Plus, the GM has nothing to do with it -- she isn't introducing obstacles of varying difficulty, it's just the player choosing what his character can do well and what he can't.<br/><br/>3. Finally, there's modifiers to your roll. So, the GM could say "this is difficult and you get a -2 to your roll." Vincent advises against this in the book. Part of why this doesn't work so well is that the stat scale is just 5 units long (-2 to +3), so you can't create a challenge that is impossible for beginners but challenging to experts and easy for long-term veterans.<br/><br/>All of this plays into AW as a fiction first game. Expertise isn't supposed to be reliably codified. Nothing should be absolutely certain, neither success nor failure, and the story's supposed to be about people. The MC is playing to find out as well, so you need spontaneity at all times. So while you can get the story of "zero to hero" in terms of how much social influence a character has, you can't do it in terms of personal expertise.<br/><br/>(Just as a math note: While it's possible to manage a total of +5 to your roll, thus reducing the chance of a miss to 0%, it's not possible to get a +8 with no chance of misses on the help rolls you would need. So those 7-9 results are always on the table, no matter what.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380026/#Comment_380026" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T04:22:06+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  4:22AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (further note on getting huge bonuses to the roll: you can't get +8 through help rolls anyway, since help rolls only give you +1 regardless of how many people help you.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380029/#Comment_380029" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T04:51:34+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  4:51AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For reals?

Say I want to take down Keeler, the badass wastelander who has a huge mob of 150 murderous hyenas. That's probably impossible for my starting Angel character to do, yeah?<br/><br/>But over the course of play I:<br/>-- increase my Hard from -1 to +2<br/>-- get a small gang, which then becomes a medium gang<br/>-- take the Gunlugger move "NOT TO BE FUCKED WITH"<br/>-- scrounge up the ruins of a tank and get the Savvyhead to get it in working order<br/>-- scope out where in his make-shift fortress Keeler lives<br/>-- take the Battlebabe move "Visions of Death"<br/>-- undermine Keeler by bribing and making promises to several of his subordinates<br/>-- etc.<br/><br/>And at this point in the game, I'm way, way more capable of inflicting serious violence (on Keeler or anybody else) than I was when the game started.  In fact, this kind of advancement is not at all unusual in AW and doesn't have to involve violence either. You can focus on getting better at manipulation or doing weird magical stuff or ancient pre-apocalypse tech or whatever it is that you want to be better at.  And you do that through achieving both mechanical (advances, moves that set up other moves, barter, gear) and fictional stuff (which is often necessary for achieving the mechanical stuff).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380045/#Comment_380045" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T09:00:03+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  9:00AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2012 9:01AM by cy.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one strength I haven't seen mentioned is Playbooks.

You play Apocalypse world, you'll engage the moves because you'll want to have some real solid effectiveness in the world and some meaningful control over what happens.  It focuses on making the immediate discrete events that take place match the expected model.  In the post apoclypse, what happens when you try to be rational and democratic is up in the air but when you put a gun to a persons head (intending to use it if you need to) and make a demand you have a pretty damn specific idea of what the outcome is going to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with murderous ghosts.  You can do whatever it is you want to, but in ghost stories about murderous ghosts if you catch the attention of a ghost, things are likely to go this way.  And you're more likely to escape or be murdered in turn than you are to reconcile the ghost in to moving on.

And whole, satisfying AW games can end long before the PCs are rivals to the gods, so it might seem that way if that's how you roll.  But that's not intrinsic to the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>(Just as a math note: While it's possible to manage a total of +5 to your roll, thus reducing the chance of a miss to 0%, it's not possible to get a +8 with no chance of misses on the help rolls you would need. So those 7-9 results are always on the table, no matter what.)</blockquote>\nThis is just wrong, I think, even with the previous correction to the help roll issue.  I can have a stat of +3, get help for +1, read a sitch for +1 (call it +2 'cause I have perfect instincts), +2 (or more!) in my car if I'm a no-shit driver, and multiple stacking bonuses of these sorts: +1 forward/ongoing from a variety of moves and situations, +1 from a variety of equipment and preparations, +1 for following the advise of someone who's oftener right, +1 if I'm eager to know and +1 by being hypnotically inspired.  Even if we only take each of those bonuses once (and there's nothing that says you have to) I come up with a +13 and it could theoretically be much higher.  Those are all bonuses that you can carefully gain across play and shepherd for that one particular moment when you, I dunno, seduce the psychic maelstrom and make him your bitch.  That shit isn't level five!<br/><br/>You don't get more hit points (unless you do) and you can always be taken out by a stray rocket or disease or whatever.

effectiveness and survivability you get from taking a B/X D&amp;D character from level 1 to level 5 is something you will never get playing AW, where your attack bonus goes up but your hp don't. Fleeing from a terrible monster in D&amp;D or examining a super-high obstacle in Burning Wheel and thinking "I need to go off and do something else--anything else--for a serious chunk of time (i.e. more than 5 rolls) before I am skilled enough to tackle this challenge" is not something that will happen in AW. Looking forward at challenges that are (more-or-less) impossible now but you will be able to pull off soon, with some hard work and improvement, and looking back at challenges that once were so hard but are now so easy as to be meaningless is not something you will do in AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380289/#Comment_380289" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-30T18:07:49+00:00" title="May 30, 2012  6:07PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, AW is for looking at challenges that are more-or-less impossible now, but you still have to do it RIGHT FUCKING NOW.
