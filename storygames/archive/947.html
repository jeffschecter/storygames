                    I figure that lots of folks here are interested in building "buzz" for their games.  I sure am.<br/><br/>Myself, I'm working on doing that by posting free demo stuff and art for it in various places (journal, ad spots on forums), using it as an example in conversations, and by finding and talking to potential reviewers (who can be people that I think will like it or hate it; doesn't matter so long as they notice it).  <br/><br/>In addition, when I come across a development or other issue related to it that other small-scale designers might be able to help with, I ask for their input.  This gets me good input and exposes these people to my stuff (hey, I'm being honest here).<br/><br/>So, how do *you* do it?                </div>

                            I'm pretty bad at creating interest for my games. It's a hit-or-miss thing.<br/>

Stuff that seems to work:<br/>
<br/>
- Having a catchy name (the word "Superf***ed" works well)<br/>
- Posting graphics<br/>
- Asking people for help/opinions<br/>

                            Welllll ... heh ... I have a wierd relationship with "buzz."<br/>
<br/>
To my mind, "Buzz" means "interest and passion about your game which has <b>no foundation in fact</b>."  So if you hear your friend telling you, in detail, what he likes about the game and you like it too ... not buzz.  But when you hear the name mentioned a lot, and you know that anything that gets its name mentioned a lot must be worth checking out ... buzz.<br/>
<br/>
Buzz is risky, risky stuff.  By definition it is going to lead to a number of people spending more time and energy (and possibly money) finding out about your system then they feel it justified.  It is going to lead to dissatisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
It is also going to lead to sales.<br/>
<br/>
Gah.<br/>
<br/>
That's a personal choice.  Personally, having pushed for buzz and gone for no-buzz I find no-buzz much more relaxing and just about as profitable.  Remember the long tail ... long after your game has had a surge of interest due to buzz it will still be generating <i>genuine</i> interest due to its qualities.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you want the buzz, here's the way to do it: other people.  Encourage people to play the game and post actual play.  Get them engaged in meaningful discussions of theory (or whatever floats their boat) in the context of your system.  <b>Wire the game into their head</b>, so that when they're looking for an example of a certain type of thing, the name of your game pops to mind.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, right in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=934&amp;page=1#Item_27" rel="nofollow">Shadowrun Beat Me</a> oliof posts that Mutants and Masterminds has a system of disadvantages that only pay off when you play them ... and cites that as a <i>Capes-like</i> mechanic.  Which ... okay, great to get the game some more publicity, but it's really more of a <i>Seventh Sea</i> or <i>Nobilis</i> mechanic, right?  They're the ones that pioneered it, and made the most use of it.  That's buzz ... my game got named because of the way it's driven into people's heads, and so the name keeps popping up in the community no matter where you turn.<br/>
<br/>
'course, it's easy for me to discount buzz <i>after the fact</i>.  Whether my sales would be what they are if I hadn't done that is harder to say.                        </div>

                            Well, here's my meager experience, perhaps underdigested.<br/>
<br/>
When I was working on Under the Bed, I didn't want to announce anything until it was done. I'm a professional designer, so I don't like to make promises that aren't real things. But that gave it kind of a slow start. On the one hand, yes,the people who have bought it have known that it's what they wanted. They've read AP threads that were very clear about what the game is really like, or they heard stories, or whatever. On the other hand, people outside the social circle that have played and outside the AP report loop haven't heard about it except for a few mentions on RPG.net.<br/>
<br/>
I'd learned from that some by the time I got rolling on Shock: I made sure that I talked about it on the Forge, where some good advice was garnered. I started talking about it on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/" rel="nofollow">my own blog</a> and linking to it. I set up a promotional page that told people what it was like. I playtested it late at night at cons with people I didn't already know intimately. Then I set a release date and stuck to it! No, wait, I blew it by four months. Well, anyway, setting a release date is only good if you're right. But the release date really started to get people interested.<br/>
<br/>
So, go to cons and enthusiastically play with people you don't know and talk to people on the net about your game when it's appropriate. Form a cabal with your game design clique and talk up each others' games (it seems sleazy, but they'll only do it if they like it anyway). Keep a design blog so fresh information stays in your audience's minds.                        </div>

                            I think that's a pretty narrowed down definition of Buzz you have there Tony. But let's set that term aside, and say that what we may be talking about is how to generate the sort of positive enthusiasm about a game that you say is not Buzz, but something else. Because I think that this sort of enthusiasm is actually quite important to sales, and doesn't have the downside that you point out with what you attribute as buzz.<br/>
<br/>
That is, it may be more beneficial to talk about how to generate this positive informed enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
This is not easy, either, but it seems to me that the best way to do it is to talk about your game clearly and intelligently until people pick up on it and want to play it. This is key - get people playing as early and as often as possible. Because only then will they be able to speak intelligently and clearly about the game as well. This is how it begins to spread.<br/>
<br/>
How do you talk about the game in a way that'll get people to bite? Well that's something that I can't really answer well, it's somewhat of an art. Some of it has been hit above. One important element is not to be pushy about it, though. Be helpful when people want help getting started, yes, that's very important. But don't push people to try your game out. Let it evolve naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it may happen that people don't try the game then. This happened to somehbody I know who couldn't even get people to comment about his game. I think everyone experiences this. If/when it happens, don't get discouraged and think that nobody will ever be interested. Try, try again. Post about it in a different venue. Post about some different aspect. Engage people in helping you with things. Talk theory. Talk about your actual play (you better be playing the game).<br/>
<br/>
But...some ideas just don't grab people. Realize that not every concept is a winner, no matter how much you may love it. Hard to know when for sure, so keep trying for a while. But, if after putting a lot of effort into it, you can't get anybody else enthused in playing your game? Might be time to try something else (at least from a sales POV).<br/>
<br/>
That's a harsh reality, but true.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing. If you contribute to other people's games, help with design, help playtest, talk their games up, they'll be more likely to do it for you. Expect a low return ratio on this - maybe one tenth of the effort you put into helping others will come back to you as their enthusiasm for your game. But it's still worth it at that ratio. Because spreading a game this way is...well it's the only way really.<br/>

                            First, generating excitement about your product is just a piece of your overall marketing strategy. The process of doing it is going to be unique to that product based on who you are, what your expectations are, and what your product is.<br>
<br>
Ideally, you will consider all these things before you unleash your game.<br>
<br>
The most important thing is building a community at home. You need a home base. Get to know the people at your local game stores and go to as many local cons as you can. It's all about getting to know the gamers in your community. Play games with them. As many as you can. Get them to play your game. Run it and demo it (I mean both full games and short demos that play for 15 minutes or so and highlight one of your favorite mechanics) at every local con you can and even non-local ones if you can afford it. Be excited and have fun. That's infectious. Make sure you show everyone that plays your game as good a time as you know how, whether you're tired, hungry, or whatever. Ask their names when they sit at your table and use it. Thank them afterward. Give them a sticker or postcard or something that looks cool and has your Web site on it.<br>
<br>
Your goal is to get at least three separate groups in your local area playing your game regularly (and enjoying the hell out of it!). <br>
<br>
Speaking of Web sites, make sure you've got one and that it's not an eye sore. Content content content. If it suits your game, scenarios are an awesome marketing tool. Whether you've got a Towns exchange, as Vincent does, scenarios, monsters and hooks as Keith has on his wiki, or scenarios like The Gift and The Sword as Burning Wheel does, it's all invaluable. They teach your fans how you play and run your game. And they give them a relatively painless way to take their new game out for a test drive with their friends. They don't need to sell their friends on playing a full campaign, they just need to sell them on trying it out for a night. Hopefully, they'll be clamoring for their friend to run the game after the experience.<br>
<br>
There are no real hobby-wide organs anymore, but the closest you're going to come is RPGnet and ENWorld. Depending on what your game is and how you want to position it, Dragon and Knights of the Dinner Table might be considerations, but unless you're going the D20 route, they probably won't really pay off for you until you yourself are a more known commodity to gamers out there. So the first thing is to be a good citizen at places like RPGnet and ENWorld, bases you've already got covered.<br>
<br>
Additionally, sites like The Forge have a far smaller audience, but in many ways (again, depending on your game), it is a self-selected community that is tailor-made to accept and actually play games that are different or not super well known. Being a good citizen at the Forge can only help.<br>
<br>
Put your game in your sig. Participate in conversations where you can use the unique perspective you've garnered from designing your game to raise points that others may not have considered before. Bring up your game when appropriate, but don't shill it. Post about your own Actual Play, both with your game and other games. Don't be afraid to warn people away from your game if you think it won't be their bag.<br>
<br>
Encourage the groups at home that are playing your game to post about their experiences. These MUST be honest posts. No shilling.<br>
<br>
Embrace controversy. The honest truth is that flame wars sell games. They sell games like no one's business. When someone posts vitriolic, hateful comments about your game (and you by extension), they are actually selling your game for you. Stay cool and even-handed in the threads. Don't sink to their level. In the long run, you'll sell more games because of it.<br>
<br>
At a certain point, when enough people are aware of/playing your game, step back and let them participate in the forums for you. Definitely still participate in the forums, and step in occasionally, but realize that your fans can bring energy and credibility to selling your game on forums that you can't match.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            As for talking about games before they're done, that's a choice you've got to make. Most of the Forge guys do it. They post playtest documents, write about their design process, describe snags they've hit, all that stuff. People like it.<br>
<br>
We (the Burning Wheel crew) tend to play our cards closer to our chests. We didn't mention Burning Empires in public to anyone until we'd sent it to the printers. Instead we gathered a group of people at our home base and just played the hell out of it. We also selected some of our most loyal fans and gave them playtest documents and access to our playtest forum. And we also involved some of our fellow designers off-line to give us comment.<br>
<br>
At the same time, we made it clear to all our fans that we were working on a secret project. We had a modest bit of buzz as they speculated as to what it would be. The buzz was heightened because we'd done the same thing last year, when we surprised everyone with Burning Sands: Jihad, which I believe was very far from what anyone expected. But this time we made it clear that it was going to be a full product rather than a supplement.<br>
<br>
We made judicious "slips" here and there, enough that our hardcore fans picked up on most of them and talked about them, renewing the speculation.<br>
<br>
Finally, we announced the product with a splashy preview page with gorgeous art and some downloadable excerpts. The buzz went through the roof and sucked in a lot of people that had not noticed until that point. We announced a preorder, and continued to put up more downloadable material for preview every few days.<br>
<br>
We added new forums to our site just for discussing particulars of the game.<br>
<br>
We had previously determined that everyone that preordered the book would also get a free copy of the PDF. So in order to build excitement going into the phase when we have physical books to sell, we sent the PDFs to those who ordered as soon as the preorder period ended. Those who preordered now feel a special cachet. They're also asking questions regarding the material in public. Doing so gets those who did not preorder to ask more questions. All of it raises the profile. Some who got the PDF have also started playing the game already, which surprised and gratified us. Hopefully they'll start talking more about their actual play soon.<br>
<br>
We've since received our approval copies, and posted pictures of them on our forums, as well as on my blog and on Dro's Polish-language blog. Luke will run the first demo scenario at DexCon this weekend, and it should be a doozy. At GenCon, he'll run it twice and I'll run it twice. I may also run it at the Games on Demand Table. We'll also be running non-stop demos at the booth. And we'll hopefully have another splashy surprise as well.<br>
<br>
Ok, that's a start, I guess. :)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Hey Guy,<br><br>Well, obviously having an English-speaking home base is a plus, as it allows you to attack online marketing from multiple angles. Without one, you'll have to work a little harder yourself until you can start generating some online fans. but the home base is still super useful. Having a local audience that is excited about your stuff and plays it is an important advantage. For one thing, it's going to keep you pumped and excited. But it also means that you're going to have lots of people to play your game with and to get feedback from. That's essential!                        </br></br></div>

Obviously, I disagree. I think us little guys should talk about what has worked for us in the trenches, and that we don't need to hire an advertising firm in order to do it.<br><br/>If the fact that the Burning Wheel crew has been doing it successfully for several years now is not enough to give me some credibility, then how about this:<br/><br/>* For a living, I edit market research reports on, among other things, online advertising and branding.<br/><br/>* My company sells pretty expensive subscriptions to its strategic analysis of online advertising and branding to more than a few Madison Avenue ad agencies and corporate PR departments.<br/><br/>* Small companies with few financial resources, like most indie RPG publishers, are on the bleeding edge when it comes to Word of Mouth (WoM) marketing techniques. Research firms like the one I work for are studying the techniques that entrepreneurs--like many indie RPG publishers--are using to communicate with their customers so that they, in turn, can sell their analysis of such techniques to Madison Avenue advertising firms.                        </br></div>

And Internet marketing in particular. Small, elegant and reactive companies can do wonders with Internet marketing that big leviathans just can't, cos they can adapt as fast as the environment moves.                        </div>

                            I'm on track for a GenCon '06 release. The thing is, I don't really see myself as a game designer, first off. If I did, I bet I'd be more focused on creating buzz (although I'm on the TonyLB side of the word). If I sell 50 copies, I'll be happy.<br/><br/>I'm too busy doing the rest of my life to get stressed about following RPGnet and so on. I'm glad it's there for folks who can or want to, it's just not in me. And by this I mean "I can't do it because I have to take care of the kids and I have very limited on-line time" not "I can't be bothered to care what people think of my game."<br/><br/>I'll be happy to share any numbers I have. So far, the hair-pulling has been modest.                        </div>

                            There is a concept in the drinks trade of brand ambassadors, people who by association with your brand help promote that brand.<br/>
<br/>
I think a similar concept can apply to rpgs.  In most internet fora there are people who are well regarded for their opinions in a particular area.  If your game falls into their area of interest, and you can get them interested in it, then people who regard that ambassador well are more likely to check out your game.<br/>
<br/>
For example, on the Forge I suspect if Ron Edwards or Vincent Baker or Paul Czege thought a game particularly interesting, that would help it get attention.  Similarly on rpg.net if say SteveD gets interested in your game, that will get it attention.<br/>
<br/>
Now, none of that will help unless the underlying product is good, but then what will?  But I do think as well as the other strategies mentioned above brand ambassadors can be important, because the question is about buzz, and what creates buzz above all else online is people who are not part of the promoter's playgroup or immediate circle who are excited about that game and whose opinion is considered worth listening to in respect of games of that type.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think one useful idea is to identify potential brand ambassadors and then provide them with free copies or run an IRC game for them and see if you can communicate your excitement to them, so they can communicate it to everyone else.                        </div>

                            Yup, "Opinion Formers" are a pretty standard way of building up awareness and recognition. People who don't just talk about products, but contribute to how people form their opinions of them. Back when I was working in tech publishing, we'd keep in contact with well-known bloggers, ask their opinions during the research process and send review copies when done. You could track the boost in sales given by even the slightest mention.<br/><br/>It's fascinating to me that a lot of the stuff Indie games designers have been doing for a few years bears of lot of similarity to the <a href="http://pinkomarketing.pbwiki.com/Marketing%20in%20the%20Post-Cluetrain%20Era" rel="nofollow">post cluetrain</a>concepts that are starting to intrude onto the web marketing arena.                        </div>
