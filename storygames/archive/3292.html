I don't love JAGS. A rules-heavy system focusing on meat-and-potatoes mundaneness is totally inappropriate a setting like this. I hate how important things like Descent and Twists are left to fiat and atrociously boring systems: "In game mechanics you get Twisted Points when the GM determines some mutation has happened"; "Weak Triggers can be fought with a WIL roll at -2." Yawn.<br/><br/>So how would you add more crunch to the important things in JAGS Wonderland? What would be a good way to make things like Reflections, Descent, Triggers and Twists more system- or player-driven? Would you graft it onto an existing system, create a new one, or modify JAGS?<br/><br/>I've contemplated Unknown Armies. At first, it seemed easy to simply have Failed notches cause descent and eventually Twists, and have skills for Survival and Mastery. However, stress checks would come a little easily in Wonderland, and I'm worried that such a system wouldn't create a real narrative rhythm.<br/><br/>Anyway, what would you do to reduce fiat and increase protagonization in Wonderland?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74709/#Comment_74709" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-09T15:26:02+00:00" title="June  9, 2007  3:26PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Systems Ive considered: Nemesis, nWoD, CoC.

It would mostly be InSpectres rules: you have Athletics, Academics, Technology and Contact skills and a talent (which adds a single die when it is relevant to a roll.) If you are playing independent or government investigators, you also get starting Franchise Dice to assign to your agency or organization. If you are members of a support group, you just get a small number of Support Dice which you can use to augment stress rolls (someone talks you through the rough times.) If you are playing uninfected people at the moment of infection, you don't get either Franchise or Support Dice until you decide to join a support group or an investigation agency. Instead of earning Franchise Dice on a mission, you earn plot points (1 on a skill roll of 5, 2 on a roll of 6.) These can be spent to renew agency resources (like earned Franchise Dice,) to reduce stress penalties, or to turn Wonderland actions into permanent advantages ("bring something back", get a beneficial mutation, etc.)</p>\n<p>In addition to the standard skills, you have Sanity/Unsanity. For uninfected characters, Sanity starts at 10, Unsanity starts at 0. For infected, players can split the 10 points between the two. The two skills have to add up to 10. You make normal stress rolls in stressful situations, but if you accrue more stress than your Sanity score, you have an Episode. In addition to the common forms of stress, make stress rolls for triggering events as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>watching or reading surreal or fantastic media, daydreaming: 1 die</li>\n<li>witnessing or interacting with someone having an Episode: 2 dice</li>\n<li>letting curiosity about the unexplained draw you in: 3 dice</li>\n<li>major mind-altering effects, like taking drugs: 4 dice</li>\n<li>witnessing the impossible: 5 dice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your stress drops below your Unsanity, the Episode "thins out" and will end soon.</p>\n<p>Cool is renamed to Mastery. You can spend Cool points to roll extra dice, either to give yourself an extra edge or to start or end an Episode (or change Chessboards.)</p>\n<p>Confessionals are changed slightly. There are two kinds of confessionals: Episode Confessionals can be used between significant events (once per player session) to describe short trips into Wonderland; the player describing the Episode gets to remove one level of stress. Dissociation Confessionals can be used during any Episode that happens on Chessboard 1 or 2 (sane areas) when the character's reflection is doing everyday, ordinary tasks (in a crazy way.) The benefit of a Dissociation Confessional is that the player can avoid waking up in jail or restrained in a padded room, or <em>choose</em> for either of those to occur.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, Dissociation is handled by treating the reflection as another character which has no dice to roll. Thus, the reflection always rolls a 1 on any task, meaning that the GM decides what happens. If the player isn't happy with that, use a modified form of the teamwork rule and loan dice to yourself (as the player of your reflection.) If you are only rolling 1 die, you can opt to describe what you are trying to do in Wonderland, roll the die, and then take the automatic 1 in Wonderland, using the die result instead to describe what your reflection does in the real world. If you have more than one die to roll, you can use one result for your Wonderland action and one for your reflection's action. The standard InSpectres die results correlate to the Wonderland Dissociation levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1-2: Total GM control = Complete Dissociation. The GM describes what the reflection does.</li>\n<li>3: Partial GM control = Major Dissociation. The GM describes what the reflection does, but the player can suggest a minor effect of the Wonderland events on the real world.</li>\n<li>4: Partial player control = Moderate Dissociation. The player can describe a limited effect of Wonderland on the real world.</li>\n<li>5: Player control = Minor Dissociation. The player's action succeeds in the real world, too, but without any impossible effects.</li>\n<li>6: Total player control = Complete Association. The impossible happens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Haven't worked out the rest, yet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr.%20Sluagh" title="Mr. Sluagh"><img alt="Mr. Sluagh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr.%20Sluagh">Mr. Sluagh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74810/#Comment_74810" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-10T15:16:53+00:00" title="June 10, 2007  3:16PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Talysman<br/><br/>Wonderful!

I don't love JAGS. A rules-heavy system focusing on meat-and-potatoes mundaneness is totally inappropriate a setting like this.

What would be a good way to make things like Reflections, Descent, Triggers and Twists more system- or player-driven? </blockquote>\nWhile I'm not a huge fan of the original JAGS (though I have played JAGS Lite once), I'm not sure you're being entirely fair. As I understand it:<br/><br/>1) The bit about making a WIL-roll to avoid Descent is prefaced with a section talking about: "All these 'random-roll' rules are for a certain type of game where you're trying to play it out in a mechanistic fashion--<i>here's how you can choose not to use them</i>.'<br/><br/>2) There's an entire chapter about how the all participants set the level of empowerment around when you get Twists... you called it GM-fiat, which kinda ignores the whole "pacing for level of PC empowerment--decided by all the participants bit that the book goes into in painful detail.<br/><br/>3) The whole "Triggering Descent" question itself is described in terms of scene framing and bangs (although those words weren't used).<br/><br/>4) Consequences of Descent are set explicitly by the player before the game begins in order to conform to the experience the player wants.<br/><br/>I mean, it's not all GM-fiat and random tables.<br/><br/>However, I can see about wanting a system that doesn't have stats and skills and stuff that would get in the way of what you really want to focus on... but don't discredit the whole game, there's a lot there under the hood which you might have missed the first time through.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GorinichSerpant" title="GorinichSerpant"><img alt="GorinichSerpant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GorinichSerpant">GorinichSerpant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467692/#Comment_467692" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T06:07:19+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  6:07AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" rel="nofollow">Colin_Fredericks</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Jeffrey: No. No one can help you now.<br/><br/>(Marco: It never came up in my game, but if the PCs had ever decided to look into the Unknown Armies rulebook on a lower Chessboard, it would have looked exactly the same as on Chessboard 0.)</p></div></blockquote>\nSo can an Adept counteract Wonderland's Unsanity with their personal Insanity. Making themselves resilient to infection to a degree. Should we be worried about how similar Adepts and Caretakers are?<br/><br/>And can an Avatar resist being dragged into the Dramas of Wonderland with the power of the Invisible Clergy, or will they simply get pulled into roles that befit their Archetype?<br/><br/>The Invisible Clergy must be on our side, right? Sure they also exist by the laws of symbols rather then the laws of physics, and symbols are closer literature then physics. And the Clergy itself can be considered a sort of the Canon of the next World, but they were once human, right? We've got vast cosmological entitys with a vested interest in keeping the world in the same sort of sanity that we know and love? It's they who are keeping Wonderland away from reality? It's the influence of vast and vague figures, that most care about pursuing their own selfish goals like caring for children or being the best at a sport or being a bumbling buffoon that keep the card people and hateful kinda-entitys out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
