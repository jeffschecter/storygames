Thanks :-) )<br/><b>Set Up:</b><br/>1. Player's start by answering questions and  doing other procedures and having discussions, which essentially is about the type of game they are playing:  mostly this nails down the games<b>Tone</b> and <b>themes</b>; and <b>world</b> and <b>genre</b>.<br/>2. Then players create a relationship map that has <b>relationship complications</b> <b>based on different PC desires, whether conflicting, mutual, or cross-purposes, etc.</b>.  This relationship conflict procedure is basically the same, albeit less machiavellian, as  is found in my game <b>House of Spiders.</b>. See  more details, in my post discussions,at this link: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21125/setup-procedures-and-design-in-story-games#latest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21125/setup-procedures-and-design-in-story-games#latest</a><br/>3. Players come up with a <b>Scenario</b>. <br/>Think of a Scenario like the intro synopsis of a movie; it says what the movie is about, it says what's involved, it sets up the likely directions the story can go in but not explicitly; it's what you would find on the IMDB page for the short intro of a movie\u2014 something like the following: <br/>"The King has fallen ill,  while at a gathering of the different houses of the Realm. Was  it natural or foul play; perhaps he was poisoned, perhaps he is under the influence of blood magic? There is suspicion in the air as the different members of the houses of the realm compete for influence and try to maneuver for political power.  Will this power be gained  honorably, or forcefully, by trickery and deceit? <br/>The throne and fate of the realm lie in the balance."<br/>4. <b>Players discuss at length the different relationships they have with other players, how they are related to other factions, the past and current situation, but they don't discuss anything that will happen in the future.</b> They have a strong basis to start play from;  they know what is happening, the relationships to others, the relationship to factions in the world, and the multitude of different possible directions the story can go in, while not made explicit in any way, these possibilities should start to germinate in the imagination. However, there will also be plenty of room for surprises, and lots of directions for the Story to go in.<br/>5.  The players come up with <b>three acts</b>. These acts don't describe what will happen, and what happens in them is played out not described beforehand. They are more like <b>setting the overall scene and potential directions of the story for the act</b>; so the third act might be something like the following:<br/>"The different factions and characters maneuver and act to finally fulfill their deepest desires and goals. The fate of the realm is in the balance.  Who will be the victors and who will be defeated,  as the fate of our characters, the crown, and the realm is decided.<br/> <br/>Continued....                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463860/#Comment_463860" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T02:01:22+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  2:01AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2017 6:19PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Play:</b> <br/>6.  At the beginning of playing each act, the players brainstorm <b>three majors questions</b>,  which they are excited to see answered. These questions must move the story forward in interesting ways, generate drama and conflict,  and must somehow directly or indirectly affect the PCs in someway. The three questions that the players come up with are used as seeds and inspiration; they don't necessarily have to be used in the act. As the story develops they can, as a group, add questions that become more fitting or interesting to the story.  Not all the questions have to be used in the act, there simply for inspiration. <b>The act develops the same way That acts do in movies. There is a situation, complications involving the PCs, rising action, different agendas, rising obstacles and challenges, a climax,  and a resolution. The acts end once this process is fulfilled, this process is made explicit with suggestions and techniques that will help the act be successful. </b>There will be a lot of suggestions in my games that help players understand the typical elements of a good, successful story and  good, successful story ending to make it easier for them to create one.<br/>7. For each question the players create  they will also <b>create 2-3 potential obstacles or challenges, called "Conflicts"</b> that will get in the way of answering the question or present a challenge or complication to the PCs in some other related way. Again,  these obstacles are seed obstacles and are optional and only for inspiration. Also, just like the questions the obstacles can change, and obstacles can be added as the story develops and other obstacles become more fitting. Not all obstacles have to be used. <br/>Questions and challenges/obstacles should always be created in a way that moves the story in an interesting direction for the players. These are questions that the players really want answered and that will really add something to the story.<br/>8. The other procedure that helps to create conflict is that<b> any PC can introduce costs complications</b>  when another PC is acting and they think that they are achieving something too  easily or more importantly that some type of cost or complication etc. will improve the story. The PC who suggests the cost or complication and the PC who the cost or complication affects will come to a consensus about what happens. With the PC proposing the cost and complication suggesting what happens and the other PC modifying it, the whole group can get involved if the PCs can't come to and agreement. it is important, that the cost or complication is always something that takes away from what the PC being act upon wants, it must be something the PC cares about, that  it is important to them.  It is important, that This is never used in any circumstance except to improve the story, and the cost or complication can be vetoed by the group if the group does not think it benefits the story.  (The term of these cost and complications will likely be a <b>conflict</b>,  being that this is the nomenclature typically used in stories.)<br/>9.  Players go around the table clock wise taking turns framing scenes.<b> Before the player whose turn it is frames their scene they draw a bead, these beads consist  of the six main colors: yellow, green, blue, purple, red, orange. </b> <b>These colors correspond to different primary emotions</b>, like in the emotional color Wheel, in the post below, although simplified and more fitting to gameplay. Although, there may be two or three  closely related emotions per color for the acting player to decide from.  <b>The player must have their PC  pursue what they want in the scene based on the emotion that they draw</b>. So for example, a player that drew a red bead for Anger, would have to play out the scene guided by that emotion. Perhaps the player would hurt someone verbally or physically, or in a fit of fury decide to take revenge.  Perhaps the player's character would set up a situation in which they would make a deal with another character to set up the character they despised. You could interpret things tons of different ways. Really the character can do anything so long as their action is guided by the emotion they drew, and it is not done in such a way that the game loses verisimilitude, it has to be genuinely  A way in which their character would act and not be forced. The  interpretation would be modified according to the type of character you were,etc; an honorable character would do something much different from a manipulative character for example. So whatever Color the player drew, it loosely directs the emotion that their character uses to get what they want in the scene.<br/>10. Players go around the table clockwise framing scenes. In every scene, with the exception of "color scenes" (nothing to do with the colored beads) that may be played at a players discretion, The player framing the scene directs their characters, to get what their characters want in the scene from their character's perspective; always from characters perspective ALWAYS from characters perspective. When it is made obvious what the framer's PC wants from the scene, the other players hold up either a green or red bead; the green bead means that the framer's PC gets what they want, the red bead means that the framer's PC does not get what they want,  from their character's perspective. If the majority of other players hold up green beads the framer's character gets what they want, if the majority of other players hold up red beads the framer's character does not get what they want. Once the players playing the scene see whether the character gets what he wants, they finish playing out the scene to match the results that other  players voted for, with the scene ending with the character either getting what they want or not.<b>This part is very important, the other players must vote red or green based on what they believe will be best for the story.</b> This works like Fiasco,  except that the players must interpret things a little bit more strictly then in Fiasco.  The players vote based on what they think will be best for, and make, the best story. What is "best" for the framer PC must always be based on what the PC wants from their perspective, that is what the framer's PC wants. Also, there is no group of beads in the middle  and players can always vote that the framers PC either gets what they want or doesn't get want they want, there is no situation where they run out of one color,  because there's nothing to run out of, because that's not how the rules work. Besides these small differences, the mechanic works like it does in Fiasco. I will credit all the game designers ideas I used in my game and all the ideas that were inspired by other games in detail and give them the credit they deserve of course.<br/>11. The players play out all three acts and come to a satisfying conclusion and that's basically The short version of how the game workS.<br/><br/>Again ask me for any clarifications  you would like me to cover <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463862/#Comment_463862" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T02:09:30+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  2:09AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2017 5:33PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the emotional color wheel I was talking about. Mine will be simplified with only six colors and will only use emotions which will generate a good story and conflict and drama and scenes that reveal who characters are via emotion.  I will probably have three different emotions, per a bead color, which are similar to one another, which the framing player can choose from to inspire the direction of their scene and to used to act out the scene based on their PCs emotion (based on the color of the bead they drew) and what their PC wants in the scene.  It's a simple game so I'm gonna start play testing it pretty quickly. It'll probably be possible to simplify it even further.

Later when I have more time I may be able to do a rewrite to explain things more clearly. <br/><br/>What drives the process of play?<br/><br/>First, we define the tone, setting and setting details, genre, and themes. Then we create a scinerio as defined above. Second, we define our characters and their relationships to one another and their relationship complications, and their place in the world very explicitly.  Because of this, we are all on the same page about the type of story were going to tell. Everything is funneled in a direction and the type of story we are going to tell becomes more explicit and we don't have different expectations going into the story. We use this scaffolding along with advice and procedures that show us how to create and structure successful stories and story endings. The narrative structure and plot is actually what divides the acts and triggers the climax, resolution, and denouement in our game; not something arbitrary, like going around the table once and letting everyone frame a scene.<br/><br/>What else drives the process of play?<br/><br/>1. The biggest driver is the relationships and relationship complications. This consists of desires, goals, and secrets that are mutual, conflicting, and at cross-purposes.<br/><br/>2. Coming up with questions you want answered and pursuing those answers.<br/>3. Creating obstacles and challenges to answering these questions (i.e. conflict).<br/><br/>Both of these mechanics get the players even more on the same page about where the story is going, while leaving ample room for freedom and surprises.<br/><br/>4. Drawing a colored token that requires your PC to act out the scene from a certain emotional perspective. This requires players to  choose and frame scenes unexpectedly and takes the story and interesting directions. It also means that the PC will be acted upon more often in order to respond with the specific type of emotional reaction.  When mixed with the fact that the PC must pursue what they want in the scene, it will create a lot of conflict in the story. BTW, players only draw color tokens in the first two acts.  In the third act players are free to frame their scenes without being directed by a specific emotion. The reason for this is that the story must become more directed and players must pull the narrative threads back together in order to create a coherent satisfying ending\u2014more on this in a sec.<br/><br/>5. In the first two acts, the framer's character tries to get what they want out of the scene from the characters perspective. Before doing so, and ending the scene, the other players vote via red and green color tokens, red meaning the framer's character doesn't gets what they want, and green meaning the framer's character does get what they want.  In the first two acts, the green and red tokens tokens are added up and subtracted from one another. If there are more red tokens, the green tokens are subtracted from the red. Likewise, if there are more green tokens, the red tokens or subtracted from the green. So for example, if three players held up a green token and one player held up a red token; it would be three green tokens minus one red token, which would equal two green tokens total. In the first two acts, the result of these token votes are added or subtracted from the results of an improv dice roll. The improv dice roll has the following results:<br/>"yes, and"<br/>"yes"<br/>"yes, but" <br/>"no, but"<br/>"no"<br/>"no, and"<br/>After getting either the red or green token total, this total is used to modify the results of the role. For example,  in the above case we had two green tokens total.  Let's say the player framing the scene rolls "no, but," because the other players vote amounted in two green tokens total, the result would move two spaces up the improv dice's scale and be "yes,"  instead of "no, but." If instead the other players vote would've amounted to one red token total, the result would move down one space on the improv dices scale and be "no" instead of "no, but."<br/>Once the results of the improve die modified by the red/green token vote totals are known, the  players and up acting out the rest of the scene, with the framer's character getting what they want from their perspective to the degree that the result entails.<br/><br/>The reason I'm thinking of adding the improve die to the first two acts is to have the story going in some unexpected directions in order to have a bit of a surprise element. However, I am skeptical as to whether I need this rule, and if it will be unnecessarily cumbersome and break up the play too much. I'll try it out in playtest and make a decision.<br/><br/>6. During the third act there will be no improv die, and there will be no colored token draws that require a scene to be played out from a certain emotional perspective. Players will frame scenes how they want, given the direction of the story. And if the other PCs vote is a majority of green tokens, the framer's character will get what they want; and, if the other PCs vote is the majority of red tokens, the framers character will not get what they want. There will be no dice roll.  They will do so while going through the final stages of rising action, climax, resolution and denouement.  I strongly believe Less will be more in the situation and that the players having more control will result in a better story ending. Anyway, that's kind of how I'm thinking. Like I said, the part I'm super skeptical about is the improv die; I don't like that it breaks up the story telling and I'm not sure that what it adds is much of an improvement.<br/>Anyway, that's kind of how I see things working. I'll start play testing it and see where it goes.
