If you loved <i>House of Flying Daggers, Hero,</i> and <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,</i> then this is for you. <br/><br/>The book is going to be lovely. It'll be about 60 pages, 8.5" square with art by me and layout by Jonathan Walton. (It's going to have colored endpapers, too, which I'm really excited about.) The graphic above is a promo bookmark, which you can get inside of a copy of Elizabeth's "It's Complicated," or with a preordered copy of this game.<br/><br/>Preorders cost $24, with $5 shipping, national or international. I should have them before or right after GenCon. You can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=ssampat%40gmail%2ecom&amp;item_name=Mist%2dRobed%20Gate&amp;amount=24%2e00&amp;shipping=5%2e00&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;lc=US&amp;bn=PP%2dBuyNowBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" rel="nofollow">click this link</a> to order one.<br/><br/>Along with the rules of the game, you'll find lots of support material in the book. There's an extensive filmography (by my friend Evan, a film student and all-round excellent dude; he worked his butt off on it), a chapter about tea, and a chapter about snacks to serve during the game\u2014which ones you should buy and which you can make, and simple recipes for those\u2014so you know everything you need to throw a Mist-Robed Gate dinner party. And LARP rules too, if you're into that kind of thing.<br/><br/>This is a game for enthusiasts, and the more you know about the genre, the more fun you'll have with it. But, you don't have to be familiar with the genre to play Mist-Robed Gate (<a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=167" rel="nofollow">Meg Baker wasn't</a>), and it plays well with large groups, so the more the merrier! Go nuts, play it with all your friends <em>at once.</em><br/><br/>If you have any questions, go ahead and ask me in this thread.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156579/#Comment_156579" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T21:46:59+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  9:46PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, I remember when we played this at JiffyCon Boston back in March, with like eight players, and everyone kept interrupting the game to <i>burst into applause</i> because it was just that good.

I'm sure you can <em>play</em> with non-gamers, even if you're the only rpg-knowledgeable person in the room, but this edition isn't specifically targeted toward the new gamers set, so it doesn't discuss things like scene-framing techniques, pacing, etc. It's more important to have genre knowledge than gaming knowledge, in the end.</p>\n<p>It's very simple, structurally. When you want something from someone, you tell them, which gives them the opportunity to hurt you. This can escalate with demands and counterdemands up to the point of stabbing a character's sheet, which represents an attempt to kill them. It's a little like Polaris with a knife. Plus there's a system for sets, props, and wirework.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the links, Jon! I didn't think of that.</p>\n<p>Guy, that's how much I'm selling it for.

Let's pretend that you don't know exactly what my character wants from you, but you suspect that it has something to do with your father and the King of Qin.<br/><br/>So we do this scene between Li Rong and Song the Lesser (ouch!) in the wine shop. At first we are just talking in character, but eventually things get down to business and, when it looks like there might be a conflict emerging between us, someone (either one of us or another player) removes the cover from the knife.<br/><br/>Now the knife is uncovered but still SHEATHED.<br/><br/>Because the knife is still in its sheath, I can't actually tell you what I want from you.  I have to simply imply it.  So I say, like, "The skies of Qin are clear and blue, but my lord knows that, one day, the night shall come upon us.  Surely, the night shall come upon us all, in turn, and what then matter our <i>earthly squabbles of the flesh</i>?  No, it would be better if every man were reconciled, one to another, as I am to you, my brother.  Just so."<br/><br/>And, saying that, I take the uncovered blade and hand it to you, since I just made an implied demand.  Here are your choices:<br/><br/>1) Agree to my implied demand (without knowing exactly what it is) and hand the blade back to me.<br/>2) Draw the blade, escalating the circumstances and giving yourself new options. My demand is outrageous!<br/>3) Pass the blade to another player and imply my demand (or whatever you guess my demand is) to their character, deflecting responsibility.  If you deflect to a character not in the current scene, it's your responsibility to inform them of the demand in the next scene (tell them, they recieve your letter, etc.)<br/>4) Initiate a fight!  Try to beat me up for daring to imply such a thing!<br/><br/>Why don't you describe how you might respond, in four different ways, and we'll follow the different choice branches from there?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157250/#Comment_157250" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T16:04:27+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  4:04PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I've committed myself utterly to the permanence of the flesh, blasphemed, and entreated with hungry spirits to learn the secrets of this permanence... given this, perhaps I should resolve past matters, before I stand alone upon the Earth, and all else have gone into shadow."<br/><br/>"All this talk of squabbling flesh, and there you sit so fetchingly dressed!

It's meant to emulate a specific kind of wuxia, namely the big budget, trainwreck heartbreak style developed by Ang Li, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_China#The_rise_of_the_Fifth_Generation.2C_1980s-1990s" rel="nofollow">Fifth Generation Chinese film directors</a>, and a few others.  The fights in these movies are generally about resisting demands made on you by others, stalling when you are given a choice you must make, by refusing to choose between the options in front of you.  So that's where the fight rules are coming from.<br/><br/>The other option would subvert the rules a bit but might allow the kind of thing you're talking about, is to have a fight that's not mechanically a "fight" according to the rules, but a normal part of description and inter-character interactions.  Like, instead of having a conversation in the wine shop, we're having a fight in the wine shop that, mechanically, is considered just description, not an actual fight.  And then I could imply your father is dying by my choice of fighting style.  Something like that.  But the fight rules are based around resisting a demand, so if you're not doing that, it probably shouldn't be a "fight" according to the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157310/#Comment_157310" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T05:24:34+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  5:24AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was sort of my instinct on both counts- especially subverting the description rules, and describing the kung-fu rather than saying the dialog... in the end, it comes to the same thing mechanically and narratively- convey your desire without saying it directly.  <br/><br/>"I strike, and then sway as if lightheaded.  The blow is masterful, but my stance breaks down, my technique is flawless, but the fundamentals of my style are disintegrating as you watch."<br/><br/>The trainwreck heartbreaker isn't anything new for the genre though... the Shaw's wuxia films were often melancholic bloodbaths, though they're more famed in the US for all the the standard "avenge my master" films they churned out.

You agree and pass the blade back to me:</b>\n<blockquote>"I've committed myself utterly to the permanence of the flesh, blasphemed, and entreated with hungry spirits to learn the secrets of this permanence... given this, perhaps I should resolve past matters, before I stand alone upon the Earth, and all else have gone into shadow."</blockquote>\nNow I have the following choices: 1a) set down the blade, satisfied with your agreement, or 1b) draw the blade, escalating because I'm not satisfied with your answer.  However, let's assume that I agree, saying, "Fair journeys, Mr. Song." We'll follow the knife-drawing branch in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> below.<br/><br/><b>2. You escalate and draw the blade!</b>\n<blockquote>"All this talk of squabbling flesh, and there you sit so fetchingly dressed!   I think our flesh most certainly should not squabble, indeed, should be most<i>warmly</i>reconciled."</blockquote>\nThis is the main track we're going to follow from here, since it branches out into the choices you make with a drawn knife.  Now that you have a drawn blade, you pass it to me and openly declare a demand.  The blade is drawn so there's no need to imply things anymore.  What's your demand?  That our characters have hot monkey sex?  Note that demands, with the blade drawn, are basically backed by the threat of violence.  Basically, you're saying: "Agree to this or try to kill me" because you're crazy, headstrong, super-passionate wuxia heroes.<br/><br/><b>3. You deflect responsibility for my demand to someone else!</b>\n<blockquote>"Somewhere my heart might be breaking, little sister, but not here.  Not here."  (somewhere distant, a young fisherman just pulled a ornate jade jar into his boat with a net full of fish)</blockquote>\nIn the next scene, the player responsible for the fisherman, another PC, has just been handed the knife and given responsibility for fulfilling what he thinks my demand is.  At this point, that character has the same choices that you faced in the last scene: a) agreeing, b) escalating, c) passing, or d) fighting.  He might 3a) decide that its his duty to return these organs to their household so that they can be properly buried and begin tracking down the engraved seal, which links to your family, or 3b) decide that he will threaten to smash this spirit relic unless its creator does something for him, drawing the knife and making a demand himself, or 3c) give the jade jar as a present to his beloved, another PC, or 3d) attempt to throw the jade jar back into the sea, refusing to make a choice and fighting against the ghostly spirits and magical protections that emanate from it.  And then things develop from there.  Let's stop following this branch now, because it's just the same as this one.<br/><br/><b>4. You refuse to make a choice and we fight!</b>\n<blockquote>I make a deliberately boorish grab for her, provoking her to slap me.  It's ON.</blockquote>\nOnce you start a fight, you've moved from the negotiation based resolution of the knife to a different form of resolution.  It's very much like getting to the stage of rolling dice in <i>Polaris</i>, once the ritual phrases negotiations have broken down and you've reached the exact point of disagreement.<br/><br/>Fights are conducted in a freeform fashion, with us describing or acting out what we're doing while all the other players serve as an audience, but an interested audience, because each player gets to vote secretly on which of us they think to win the fight.  They can vote completely arbitrarily, based on how they want the story to go, whose description they find more evocative, who they want to lose/win, etc.  We can also swing the vote our way by invoking traits to gain extra votes for our side, so if we were playing crazy Exalted M-RG, this is when you'd yell "Ever-Perfecting Drunken Clarity Prana!" or if you were playing it more straight, invoke colors or natural imagery (rain, vines, waterfalls) that are associated with your character and throw another colored token into the bag for yourself.  The game itself has more details about using traits, which I won't go into here.  Once everyone has voted, the fight reaches its climax and we draw a token from the bag.  So, as Elizabeth put it, it's a "rigged election" system, because frequently the bag will rule against the majority of votes.<br/><br/>Let's say we fight and you win!  We utterly destroy the wine-shop, but, in the end, your martial prowess is stronger and resist being forced to make a choice about my demand... for now.   In the aftermath, you have the following choices:<br/><br/>4a) Enforce a demand, but this one works less well because you haven't made one of me.  This is a better option for me if I won, forcibly dragging you home to your father or just sending you on your way there.<br/>4b) Seize a prop or set, such as a weapon of mine, a faction I control, an office I hold, a location that serves as my base.  Maybe you're now the King of Qin's champion!<br/>4c) Seize the blade, if you didn't already have it, but you do.<br/>4d) Finally, you can soothe the blade, which means moving the blade escalation backwards.  You'd take the SHEATHED knife and return it to being COVERED.<br/><br/>In any case, having a fight stops progress along the branching tree of knife negotiations.  In fact, that's generally why you fight, because you don't like the choices the knife presents you.<br/><br/>So... make your demand for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and we'll follow that branch.<br/><br/>EDIT: Cross-posted, but I think I'll leave the movie breakdowns to Shreyas, since it's his game and he can talk better about his intentions.  I'm just describing how the system works in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157316/#Comment_157316" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T06:32:23+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  6:32AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, it's coming together for me... <br/><br/>That's really different... <i>intense</i>.<br/><br/>Intristink intristink.<br/><br/>Alright, I'm holding the naked blade at this point, yes?<br/><br/>... <i>appropriate</i>.<br/><br/>Alright... how much about my desire can I lay out?

If you're to the point of implying demands, then you or some other player should remove the cover.  In play, I use the tiny metal Chinese-style longsword that I got with <a href="http://www.drmasterbooks.com/chinesehero_v1.html" rel="nofollow">the Deluxe Version of the Chinese Hero comics from Dr. Master</a>.  It stays wrapped in a handkerchief on the table, as if it's inside a ceremonial sword case (I really need to get a tiny letter-opener box for it or something) until it's uncovered.  Bailey's clickpen idea would totally work, if you didn't have other implements, and might work really well in other genres, like spy films (remember the clickpen in Goldeneye?!!)<br/><br/>The sword actually has four states: covered, sheathed, drawn, and bloodied, the latter of which we haven't gotten to (it happens when you stab other people's character sheets, trying to kill them).  I prefer to think of the "sheathed" stage as "sheathed" and not "uncovered" because it implies escalation (you unsheathe a sheathed sword) rather than de-escalation (you cover an uncovered sword).  But yeah, those terms could potentially be interchangable.<br/><br/><b>Bailey:</b> You get to make your demand of me, but you can't be like "I want her to fall in love with me so I can reject her."  It needs to be a request that the character DO something, not just that something should happen or events should unfold in a particular way.  Otherwise, it's not a demand, just scene framing or something. Saying "I want you to go home to your master in disgrace, but be passionate in love with me" seems fine to me, though some groups (and maybe Shreyas too, I don't know) may prefer that demands be made in character.  But in our Boston playtest, sometimes demands were actually character-to-character, but sometimes demands would be made on the meta-level, player-to-player, like: "Okay, so what my character is demanding is that you kill the demon that your child has become."<br/><br/>So let's say you pass me the unsheathed blade and make the meta demand: "I want you to go home to your master in disgrace, but be passionate in love with me."  Now I have the following options:<br/><br/>1) Agree and set down the blade (still unsheathed), which I would probably do, because that's awesome bloody story meat.<br/>2) Pass the blade and make your demand to someone else, which would also be pretty good, making someone else fall in love with you instead.  But then they have the same unsheathed blade and the choices facing me right now.<br/>3) Stab your character sheet with the blade, in an attempt to kill you.  This escalates to BLOODIED.<br/>4) Reject all these choices and fight!  This takes us back to the post-fight choices, after resolution.<br/><br/>Let's say I do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, to follow the tree all the way through.  I define one of my blank prop cards as "the Heartbox of Song the Lesser," pull it out on the table, and say, "<i>I knew it would be foolish to bargain with scum such as you!  You know nothing but how to cavort with whores!</i> And then I try to smash your heartbox with the heavy end of my pipa."  After narrating that, I stab your character sheet with the knife, which, interestingly enough, means you now have the knife, stuck in you.  That gives you these options:<br/><br/>1) Make a demand of the world and die.  This is something that will ultimately prove to be true, showing the impact of your death.  You can't demand the death of another PC (that's a different option), but you can call for just about anything else.  Like, "Your master will betray you before the end!" or "You will come to regret the love you rejected here, as you will never know another!"<br/><br/>2) Make a final demand of me or another PC and then die.  This also can't be their death, but it can be anything else.  Like, "You will ensure that no one ever buries any part of me!" or "You will consume my spirit organs so that I can live on inside of you!" or "You must take this object and give it to my father" or whatever else.  If you choose this option, then I have two choices: 2a) agree to your demand, or 2b) die, getting killed along with you, right on the spot.  The latter case is how you get mutual destruction, like the final scene of Flying Daggers.<br/><br/>3) Reject all these options and fight!  This becomes pretty interesting when a character has already been stabbed, because, if you win, you can choose to "soothe the blade" and that means being able to <i>pull the knife out of your character sheet and prevent yourself from dying</i>.  But if you lose, you're still dead and I get to choose between the post-fight options.  However, after being stabbed, fighting is the only way to prevent yourself from dying.<br/><br/>Does that all make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157348/#Comment_157348" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T09:36:57+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  9:36AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That all sounds quite fantastically badass... <br/><br/>Though, it seems that a suitably stabby group could have a TPK pretty fast.  <br/><br/>Given how easy it is to die, what can you do when your character is dead?<br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157369/#Comment_157369" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T10:20:47+00:00" title="July 18, 2008 10:20AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play another character?

TSOY, perhaps, or something else built for long-form play (and probably one with a GM, actually).  And then I'd drop the knife ritual over top of it.  So like, we'd play for a bit and use the normal TSOY resolution, but, when you wanted to invoke the trainwreck heartbreak emotional blackmail aspects, reach for the knife.  And deaths from the knife ritual would supersede all other mechanical considerations.  Maybe you'd replace MR-G's fight mechanics with the normal TSOY (or whatever) fight mechanics, but the victor would still get to choose from the fight aftermath 'booty list.'<br/><br/>Also, I just had this massive sense of deja vu, like we've had this conversation before on RPGnet.

There are some aspects of movie-style wuxia (as opposed to literature-style wuxia) that it doesn't cover as well as I might like, such as giving players tools for building scenes in the shot-by-shot visual language of movies, but those aren't necessarily goals that Shreyas shares, at least for this particular project.  It's certainly not the Holy Grail of all wuxia games, but it gets so many things right and is super fun to play.<br/><br/>I feel like there could be a really potent mechanic that combines ritual negotiation (like the blade method or <i>Polaris</i>' ritual phrases or <i>Mridangam</i> or <i>Waiting/Tea</i> or <i>Kazemaki Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</i>) and character evolution (like Keys in TSOY), but I haven't quite put my finger on how that might work yet.  Like, how cool would it be if each player could develop their own ritual negotiation method and have it change and grow over time, as a metaphor for developing your character's fighting style and learning from others through training or fighting with them?  Figuring out how different negotiation methods could interact would be the hardest part, but that would be totally boss.  If we could do something like that, it would open up a world of different design and play possibilities...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157427/#Comment_157427" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T14:25:23+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  2:25PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2008 2:26PM by Lord_Minx.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I've been wondering: All the knife-play so far (Which sounds awesome, btw.) has been between two people.

Now, I get to narrate a scene (How does that work, btw? Round-robin or something more complicated?) and want to have a conflict with somebody. But the blade is already unsheathed, so there is no way I can be all Imply-y and stuff? I have to declare openly? Also, unless somebody else get's in a fight with me or refuses my requests and I get in a fight with him and de-escalate, there's no way for me to get back to the indirect level? <br/><br/>Also, what do the other people do while you and Baily have your conflict? Any way to influence it unless you get in a fight and we're called to vote? Anything in place, rules-wise, to stop two people from hogging all the spotlight with back and forth demands?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157428/#Comment_157428" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T14:28:20+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  2:28PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, should I ever play this, I'd set every players characters sheets on some extra plate of soft wood, so that people can actually slam the knife into the sheet and have it stick there.

Players can assist in other people's fights by supplying useful traits (extra votes).  If the blade is unsheathed (doesn't matter who did it), you can declare your intentions unless someone "soothes" the blade and returns it to being sheathed.  Hogging is deterred by 1) if your character (or their direct agents / props) is not in a scene, you can't make demands, and 2) excessive use of the knife ritual usually means you end up dead quickly <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157475/#Comment_157475" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-19T01:13:03+00:00" title="July 19, 2008  1:13AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, that's exactly what I wanted to know.

In a multiple-session game, I might suggest periodically converting old cast members into props and doing a new character-creation sequence, so as to refresh the cast.</p>\n<p>Jonathan, thanks for covering for me!</p>\n<p>I'd suggest 4 players at the minimum; when you have 3 it's easy for a boring cutthroat 2-vs-1 situation to arise and stabilize, but when there are 4 you can have 3 factions or 2 that can trade loyalty a bit more freely.</p>\n<p>Carl, Curse of the Golden Flower is, like, one of the primary inspirations for this thing.

When do I realize I've agreed to help a revolutionary society attempt an assassination of a provincial official rather than agree to talk to my brother about his marriage plans?<br/><br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157707/#Comment_157707" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-21T11:47:42+00:00" title="July 21, 2008 11:47AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Sure, chess has a commonly accepted repair routine.

In two playtest games we already incorporated both flashback scenes and player-enacts-the-posthumous-schemes-of-their-character devices seamlessly into play. If you're playing it as a multi-session game, you probably want to treat each session of play as an individual movie or episode, which means you should freely incorporate new PCs each time play begins again.<br/><br/>I'd say that probably the sweet spot for playing this game as of the last time I played it is something like 5-6 players (note that this is a little higher than the usual sweet spot for games, because of the high theatricality/audience participation factor -- no one really feels left out when it isn't their scene), but the spots below and above that are still very functional. Down to three players, I imagine you'd need to carefully design your characters to ensure that a proper triangle relationship emerges, but with that out of the way you should be set to do something similar to HoFD. On the top end, we played it with 11 players and it ran so smoothly that literally the only concern was making sure everyone's seating arrangements were satisfactory, and how sad we were when part of the group had to leave.<br/><br/>Note that the math in the kung-fu fights scales in a way that different size games play differently, but well in each case. In a 3-4 person game, the audience vote is dwarfed by the impact of trappings, which gives each of the characters true protagonist power and drives the other players to actively intervene in scenes if they want to influence how a fight plays out, just as they actually do in the small-cast wuxia films. In a 9-11 person game, the audience vote has the largest effect, pushing all the characters into their proper roles as unique characters nonetheless subject to the whims of an ensemble drama where any given action might tragically be for naught in the face of the broader picture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158818/#Comment_158818" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T20:15:50+00:00" title="July 26, 2008  8:15PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ssampat/2704791127/" rel="nofollow" title="Tom Kha Kai by njyar, on Flickr"><img alt="Tom Kha Kai" height="334" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/2704791127_f4d630e350.jpg" width="500"/></a><br/><br/>So, we're "recipe testing," which is to say that we were in the mood to eat something that happened to be in the book.
