Let's not do that here. Let's have an intelligent discussion. <br/><br/>So I have some theories about GNS Sim and people's perception of it. There's this thing called Sim and it's pretty well described and circumscribed but a large majority of gamers don't understand it very well. They don't get it because either they don't understand what folks (primarily Ron Edwards) mean when they say Sim or because they do get it but have very little in their gaming experience that matches up with the Sim definition (yet they clearly don't fit into Narrativist or Gamist play).<br/><br/>My thesis is that a large majority of gamers aren't playing Sim, Nar, or Gam because their essential gaming experience is passive and reactive, and not actively creative.<br/><br/>Now, before you tar and feather me and ride me out of town on a rail and do all kinds of other things that haven't been done since 1850, let me explain.<br/><br/>First of all, I'm not saying they aren't having fun. I'm not even saying they're having wrongbadfun. I believe they're having a good time and good on them.<br/><br/>Second, I'm not casting any kind of value judgment on "passive and reactive." When you go to a movie, you are passive but not very reactive. Passive is a good thing when you go to a movie, because it keeps the other patrons from shouting at you to shut up and be quiet. You're there to be entertained. Hopefully, your movie entertains you. RPGs are participatory, so there's a requirement for the players to react. Being reactive is a requirement of all role-playing. If you are not reacting, you might as well not play with other people. <br/><br/>Third, I'm not casting an kind of value judgment on "not actively creative." Again with the movie analogy: People go to a movie to be entertained, not to write stories. I think a lot of gamers come to the table with that in mind. I think a lot of people in the story games community think that's lame, but we should reconsider. I wrote about this a while ago in <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/229074.html" rel="nofollow">a blog post about Illusionism</a>, inspired by the Theory from the Closet interview with Mike Mearls (<a href="http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2008/08/19/show044-interview-with-mike-mearls" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%2344&amp;Mode=like">#44</a></a>). Mike thinks that some gamers game to be entertained, and they want the GM to be the entertainer, and that's okay. I think it's okay, too, even if it's not always what I want.<br/><br/>People who want to be entertained, I think, want the movie experience. They want to have a good time, follow the GM's story, and give just enough input to feel like maybe they're in the movie. Without input, the movie is about someone else. With too much input, it's not a movie anymore, and it feels too much like being the director or screenplay writer, and that kills the magic.<br/><br/>So is that a Sim Creative Agenda? A CA is a means of filtering role-play input such that you get other people to be excited about the stuff that excites you. It's a set of <i>priorities</i> for play. What is the filter mechanism or priority for the movie-goer-style gamer? Certainly they have a set of criteria (probably unconscious) for deciding when to talk, what to say, and so on. But what? The personal experience they're seeking is a combination of social connection and "being part of the story." I don't think that really says anything about how they figure out what they say during the game, or how they get other people excited about the stuff that excites them. In a way, it's a very internal way to play. <br/><br/>A lot of GM advice gives a nod to this. Consider the "player type" advice in Robin's Laws. As the traditional wisdom goes, there are different kinds of players and the GM should figure out what they want and give them opportunities to do that, so no one gets bored. The GM is the entertainer and the players are there to be entertained. <br/><br/>Some story games attack the "no one gets bored" problem from a different direction. Find a group of players who all like to do this narrow(er) activity. Make the players responsible for making it very clear what they want. I'll bet a lot of these games were written by frustrated GMs. <br/><br/>Wanting to be entertained isn't a Creative Agenda. It's a social mode. It's my guess that some of those people are actually playing a Sim game, as defined by the "Right to Dream" or "constructive denial" models that Ron and others have described. The heavy-immersion, I-want-to-be-in-this-world folks are probably Sim players. Others might be doing a Vanilla Narrativism thing (addressing premise in light ways without game tools to support it). A bunch of players--especially those playing D&amp;D 3E and 4E--are doing a Gamist thing at least some of the time. And probably a large portion of them are mixing different CAs, wanting different things at different times, <i>prioritizing</i> things in different ways at different times, and not always achieving their creative goals.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186241/#Comment_186241" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T10:00:35+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 10:00AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, Adam.

I have a group that's very much in the "entertain me" mode, but they loooooove getting riled up, diving in, yelling at each other, and in general responding to the situation set up via a GM's activity (and their attendant passivity in that context).  They love reacting to things, they do it grandly and with a great deal of creativity and even creative input that they would never do in a way that initiates a situation.<br/><br/>I also think this is the reason that a lot of RPG genres are essentially reactive (superhero comics being the most significant and clear example).

I really meant to make it clear that RPGs are not at all like movies because of the reactive bits. The "entertain me" player doesn't want to watch a movie. He wants to be in a movie, doing movie hero things, and screaming wildly and getting riled up OOC. <br/><br/><br/>Robert, <br/><br/>Consider what turn-based games do to these players. They're supposed to be watching the spotlight player and reveling in someone else's fun, but really they're in their own minds, imagining what they will have their own PCs do next or they're getting bored and losing their grooves. Left as a design exercise for Sim RPG authors.<br/><br/>Or are you talking about what some folks call "lonely fun"--the fun gamers have between play sessions?  I, for one, think lonely fun is an important glue for the RPG community. I try to include lonely-fun activities in my designs for my RPGs that aren't geared towards the one-shot.<br/><br/><br/>David,<br/><br/>I agree, in general. I don't believe, however, that most players have these preferences consciously. I suspect a lot of them do these things because that's how they learned it, and they're creatures of habit and don't like change. It's not that they wouldn't love the story to unfold during play, as it does in a game of In a Wicked Age; it's that they don't know how to do that without becoming all Director Stance-y. <br/><br/>Also, I think a lot of players read somewhere (or had it drummed into them by GMs who had read somewhere) that metagaming is BAD. "Your character says what you say!" "Put your hand on your head if you want to speak OOC!" "Your character doesn't know that, so you can't act on that!" I've heard all of those first-hand. And they work well for some groups, but I like a little metagaming. The characters in books fall into interesting situations because the author makes all these coincidences happen. If the characters were left to their own (fictional) choices, they'd never meet and nothing interesting would happen.

Yeah, players will generate new content spontaneously during play in response to prompts. Is that what they mean to do, where they get their kicks, or is it just a necessary part of the process of play? Obviously, if the players never contribute anything at all, then you don't have a game - you have a story being told. On the other hand, I have seen, again and again, players reacting to even that level of need for input with stress. They don't LIKE having to be creative. They just want to find the right answer to the problem and relieve the tension.<br/><br/>So I think in order to have creative play <b>that rises to the level of a possible creative agenda</b>, you have to have players seek out the opportunity to create content, rather than simply do it in response to tension in a "what's the right answer" mode.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where does "play" happen?

Perhaps someone could point me to a Ron Edwards piece that lays out a deninition.  It may also help the discussion to have a communal rhetorical platform.</blockquote>\nOkay, Sim is short for Simulationism, a term used in GNS Theory and, more broadly, The Big Model. Sim is a Creative Agenda (a term that I defined in my original post). Ron Edwards describes Sim in detail in an article called "Simulationism: The Right to Dream."<br/><br/>Specifically, Sim is the Creative Agenda that prioritizes <i>constructive denial</i> as a means of Getting Things Right. The Getting Things Right part trips up some people, because they haven't realized how many Things there are. <br/><br/>Different people care about Getting different Things Right. Some care about the setting. They might want to run the perfect Silmarillion (Tolkien) setting, or maybe their own slant on the Silmarillion setting with new gods they invented. Some care about the characters. Maybe they want to play a different historical person who travel through time together, and the player values portraying Benjamin Franklin as accurately as possible. Perhaps they're focused on situation, like what it's like to be a soldier in Vietnam in 1969; in this case, they might handwave characters and setting but really drill into how the events happen. Some people care about the game system and Getting it Right -- not to "win" but to explore the nooks and crannies of what the rules do -- and playing it Wrong is bad. You can focus on getting "color" right, too, but I'm having trouble explaining that.<br/><br/>This "constructive denial" thing is just a way of thinking about Sim play. Players are exercising their right to say "NO, that is wrong." Ron Edwards calls this The Right to Dream. He chose those words very carefully. The "Dream" is the imagined fiction that the players share.  It's actually less important than the other big word. The word "Right" is very important and it has several meanings. Players believe they have a <i>right</i> to this Dream and they insist that the Dream be <i>right</i>. When you have a right to something, and when something has to be right, you protect it. Sim players continually filter what they say by making sure that it faithfully executes the Dream. They are made happy when the other players go, "Yeah, man, that's right. That's it exactly." That is, they want validation that they are Right.<br/><br/>Remember, Creative Agenda is about priority, not about technique. So Sim players <i>prioritize</i> the Right to Dream over the other things (like Gamism's "Step on Up" or Narrativism's "Story Now"). That doesn't mean they don't care about those things. <br/><br/>Here's an example. I was running 1st Edition AD&amp;D and was very Sim at the time. Matt was very Gamist. He prioritized winning and showing off his mad playah skillz. His thief character encounters a bear. He considers the rules he's memorized and decides he can take the bear. I consider the situation, imagine a 350-pound bear charging his scrawny rogue, and basically see disaster. I warn him. We start arguing. Does this mean he doesn't care about in-game reality? Not at all. But where it gets in the way of his Gamist play, it gets a back seat. Does this mean I don't care about the rules? Not at all. But where the rules conflict with my Simulationist view of the setting and how things work, the rules take a back seat (or, in this case, I find some DM-fiat rule that lets me run things differently).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186269/#Comment_186269" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T11:05:14+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 11:05AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>I think the odds of Adam getting his useful discussion go down immensely if we get into definitional wrangles in thread.

I defined Sim for Trey as I see it before I read your definition. We're in agreement, in any case. I tend to back away from the "group aesthetic standard," as I believe there's a strong individual component to CA. It's a personal standard that is only realized when another player (not necessarily everyone in the group) goes "Yes! That! Cool!" CA clashes occur only when you go, "This!" and someone else goes, "Oh, fuck no! That!" and you go "Gah! No way!" Groups with players who want to play different CAs can usually avoid that stuff, or at least make nice and work it out, but not always. See my "bear" example in my last post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186271/#Comment_186271" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T11:11:46+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 11:11AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually just meant to illustrate why the term "Simulationism" is so problematic in discourse.

It used to be called Zilch-play. Not simulationism that, but might confuse a person if he is not looking at whether the players actually engage in a common SIS or are just there to listen to the GM and joke amongst themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186275/#Comment_186275" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T11:20:48+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 11:20AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Metagame intrusion sounds like it's connected to immersion and suspension-of-disbelief.

Most likely the game will function on the strength of personality from one person, likely the gm.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreative agenda isnt really an individual thing, it's a group thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a game to run effectively the players and the gm have to be able to interact with each other.  They need to know what's expected of them.  They need to know what type of characters are appropriate and how to use them/how others will approach them. What the system we are using allows the characters to do and how that informs our choice of actions.  We need to know the setting and how it relates to the characters and system.   What types of situations are the characters going to face and what resolving them will mean in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSim play emphasizes the particular way a group has chosen to answer these questions and turns it into an engine that is supposed to keep itself going.  It becomes an endless loop where we do this thing resolve it and then do something very similar but probably in slightly different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; played sim is easy enough to understand.  The characters are all adventurers and so they go on adventures.  They go into dungeons, fight battles, get treasures, win the day, level up.  Go on a new adventure against slightly more scary opponents.    The characters are unlikely to die and while things may seem scay at certain points the good guys always win.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast D&amp;D; played gamist is much more about the challenge of surviving.  Characters can be killed if the player doesnt act smart.  The team can lose and lose big time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186289/#Comment_186289" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T12:05:05+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 12:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While this thread is still shiny and wonderful and hasn't devolved into a fight yet, I just want to express my gleeful surprise at seeing people <i>get it</i>, and not falling back on that tired old "There's no coherent definition for Sim," and all that jazz.<br><br>Now, what I want to know is, <i>why the hell don't you guys do some games like this</i>?

It's not that they wouldn't love the story to unfold during play, as it does in a game of In a Wicked Age; it's that they don't know how to do that without becoming all Director Stance-y.</blockquote>\nI think all players have a strong desire for story in their games, and when those games produce a great story they are enthusiastically remembered and regaled out-of-game.  When the game fails to produce an enjoyable story, there is a collective "meh" and they try again.  In my personal experience, the "meh" sessions greatly outnumber the "YEAH!" sessions, which drove me to look for ways to actively pursue the desired outcome (i.e. different types of games).  <br><br>Which leads into your next point...\n<blockquote>Also, I think a lot of players read somewhere (or had it drummed into them by GMs who had read somewhere) that metagaming is BAD. "Your character says what you say!" "Put your hand on your head if you want to speak OOC!" "Your character doesn't know that, so you can't act on that!" I've heard all of those first-hand. And they work well for some groups, but I like a little metagaming. The characters in books fall into interesting situations because the author makes all these coincidences happen. If the characters were left to their own (fictional) choices, they'd never meet and nothing interesting would happen. They'd be roaming endless forests and encountering wandering monsters, but never finding the fighter's mentor who has the magic sword they need to kill the dragon.</blockquote>\n"Metagaming" is used to describe all sorts of behaviors, from out-and-out "cheating" (in the perspective of some) on one end of the spectrum to narrativist game mechanics on the other. The broad-brush is applied to all of it, however, and can color a person's experiences.  One of the players in my failed BW game remarked to me that "[BW] is not really roleplaying" because certain mechanics (e.g. Let It Ride, Circles) tap the player's cognizance of the emergent story.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186320/#Comment_186320" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:18:28+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:18PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Maedhros</cite>The closest I can come to a definition of Sim is "Cause-and-Effect Focused" as opposed to "Challenge Focused" or "Story Focused."</blockquote>\nEee.

But that can be an awful jumble -- one player prioritizes a LotR setting, another prioritizes mythological hero story arcs, another really wants to play X-Men (misfit tac-team) with "Orcs, Elves and Dragons" color.<br/><br/>I've come up with a system of covering the bases for myself, as a designer, but it's kind of a crappy tool for getting the players inspired -- it probably needs to filter down into play examples or faux-fiction or something.  Anyway, here's the brief version:<br/><br/><b>Fictional Conceit:</b> About what the gameworld contains, in terms of beings, objects, and structures (e.g. societies).  Also, how it will appear to player characters.<br/><br/><b>Functional Conceit:</b> About how the gameworld works.  The core of this is how player character actions affect the gameworld, and how the gameworld affects the player characters.  Also, any more general gameworld "hows" and "whys" that explain that interaction.<br/><br/><b>Protagonists:</b> The behavior patterns the players will explore directly (by playing PCs of these types) or indirectly (by playing PCs who are noteworthy for how they differ from these types).  A sort of character measuring stick.  <br/><br/><b>Taboos:</b> If you do these with your character, you're playing the game wrong.  <br/><br/><b>Conventions:</b> What kinds of things tend to happen in play?  What are some activities that represent play well?  <br/><br/><b>Motifs:</b> Color beyond the central conceit, that gives play its distinctive personality.  <br/><br/><b>References:</b> Narrative fiction or non-fiction that helps players fill in any blanks and find inspiration.  Movies, TV series, comic books, novels, etc.  <br/><br/>I've run into a problem in my game, in which the Protagonists description doesn't map to something familiar, and none of the References are quite right (I won't sidetrack this thread by going into the specifics, unless Adam asks).  Otherwise, though, I've found this to be helpful, and at least a couple designers have found Functional Conceits and Taboos to be eye-openers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186681/#Comment_186681" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T16:20:00+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  4:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 4:20PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David - I actually fumblingly have done similar things several times when playing to highly stylized genres like superhero comics. One of the best pieces of advice I ever got for a "dark heroes" game was, if I didn't want the game to turn into a gorefest, to say the following at character creation:<br/><br/>"Your character must have a reason not to kill, and that reason cannot be 'because it causes too much trouble'. By the way, it doesn't."<br/><br/>So things like taboos and references can artfully be put into character creation and thereby invested in by players. FATE's Aspects do this to a degree. I can see requiring an aspect related to the above, for example.<br/><br/>But I really like your list and the attempt to figure out exactly what every piece means, functionally.

Trust me.  Ask anyone who knows me.<br/><br/>It's a time interest thing.<br/><br/>Also, really, I'm just not that interest in recreating other people's stuff.  I'm not down on it... but really, playing <i>Star Wars</i>?  Or anything like that.  It's just not my bag.  <br/><br/>The thing about <i>Pendragon</i> is that Greg dug into the weirdness of Malory.  And it's WEIRD.  A lot of people -- I have observed -- see <i>Pendragon</i> as a kind of Basic Roleplaying with funky personality mechanics attached.  But the truth is, in my view, it is actually a very unique and strange game. <br/><br/>Because the fiction's world is so alien and different than this world, I find exploring that fiction worth my time.  Most Sim doesn't give me the same buzz.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186976/#Comment_186976" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T16:42:14+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  4:42PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get that, Chris. My favorite web.supplement that I ever wrote was adapting William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County to White Wolf's science fiction game Trinity. Because Trinity's so broad and you can do stories with virtually any kind of theme, my goal was to figure out "can I really do this bizarre Faulkneresque thing with this science fiction game?" And the answer was yes, yes, definitely.<br/><br/>I don't even like Pendragon and I can see the fun in wallowing in Malory. Someone smarter than me who actually designs games is going to someday realize that there's a mountain of very weird things piling up in public domain just outside Steamboat Willie and we're going to have a steamroll of awesomely strange adaptations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186979/#Comment_186979" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T16:47:13+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  4:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, <br/>As for interest, there's always the option of Simming <i>something new</i>.  Something you came up with yourself.  Perhaps something strange, wonderful, and compelling that will come to you in a vision/daydream (most of my projects start with a tableau of some fictional situation that just springs into my head, and I'm like, "Whoa!  I want to play a game where <i>that</i> happens").  Sure, more daunting that "let's do Star Wars," but also hella more interesting.<br/><br/>And as for time, there's plenty of that in the future.

One of them was an attempt at what I thought was Narrativist at the time, but it was branded Sim by Ron Edwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it makes you sad, they've been in the works for years. The above mentioned, ReCoil, is available for playtesting, though. Playtesting is the thing that's kept it from moving forward. Trying to get a group together to play it myself has been difficult. I've had trouble getting a *D&amp;D;* game going, let alone "this thing I wrote". Outside playtesting hasn't happened either.. or if it has, they're all studiously keeping it a secret from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other one is just a mental block or two. Eventually I'll find the right charge of C4 to blast through them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to be a dear, you could give ReCoil a look. My website's been having problems although my hosting service seems to think it's fine.

Once we have something inspiring, I'd like to walk through an effort to transform the genre conventions into system elements.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187038/#Comment_187038" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T00:16:29+00:00" title="January  9, 2009 12:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I need to get Joe McDonald to write a summation for me, 'cause I suck at trying to sum up my games in a compelling fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nReCoil is about Agents, who are actually spirits of the deceased who have joined the fight against a faceless force which would destroy reality. Not just physical reality; all of it. One of the defining concepts of the game is that reality is consensual, formed by belief. The minions of the enemy, called Naughtwraiths enter the physical world, where belief is strongest and most stable, and try to undermine and weaken it by destroying the foundation of belief upon which it is all founded. The Agents also enter the physical world, called the Coil (as in the mortal coil) to try to stop this from happening. There's one fairly serious wrinkle: Being dead, they don't have bodies. To be in the Coil at all, they must join with a Host, a mortal person. To complicate things, their enemies do, too. Being from outside it, Agents and Naughtwraiths have an unusual level of control over what is and isn't possible. This translates as the ability to do harm to reality, purposely or otherwise, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe play of the game is *supposed* to feel something like Quantum Leap and the Matrix rolled up together. You have to discover the Naughtwraiths' plot by discovering the situation you're in, and at times, there should be some crazy martial arts and guns action.<br/>\n<br/>\nLacuna is, IMO, a spiritual sibling. Whispering Vault is also, but it's a much older sibling that was put up for adoption a long time ago, and ReCoil never knew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187234/#Comment_187234" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T13:49:19+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  1:49PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2009 1:52PM by Marshall Burns.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lance,<br>Sure, I'll take a look at it.
