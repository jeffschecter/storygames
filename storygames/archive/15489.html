I've been working away at this game for a couple of years now and it's finally ready to print. It's called <i>The Final Girl</i>. It's a horror movie RPG, it plays in about 1.5-2.5 hours, and I've played with groups of as few as 3 and up to 8 people. It emulates any horror movie where you have a cast of characters who are picked off one-by-one until only one person remains to confront the killer. It's rotating GM, players play multiple characters and there's no traditional character ownership, and it uses playing cards as the resolution mechanic. I designed it for casual gamers and horror movie fans, or anyone who wants a game they can pick up and play with a group in a couple hours. Cover art is by Jennifer Rodgers, and it was edited and laid out by Joshua Bishop-Roby.<br/><br/>I'm going to start taking pre-orders sometime in the next 24 hours I think (it'll be $10 + $2 shipping) and wanted to talk it up a bit in case anyone here is interested. Or, hell, we can talk about horror movies if you like. In the last week I've watched They Live, Hostel, and Scream (Hostel was my favorite of the three).<br/><br/>Pre-order information will be forthcoming.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351270/#Comment_351270" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T12:26:39+00:00" title="December 12, 2011 12:26PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2011 12:27PM by jenskot.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any actual play we can read online?<br/><br/>Does it take 2.5 hours even with 8 players?<br/><br/>How many pages is the rule book?<br/><br/>Do I have to read the rule book in full before playing?<br/><br/>Are there character sheets available to preview?<br/><br/>Will any play aids or rules references be available?<br/><br/>If I want to emulate They Live, can I use your rule system to play out a long pseudo wrestling match?<br/><br/>How long does it take to make characters?<br/><br/>How hard is it to GM when it is your turn to do so?<br/><br/>$10 sounds cheap!

But since you're not, you're just going to have to wait!<br/><br/>John, I know I posted some actual play somewhere. There's an SG AP vignette <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11626" rel="nofollow">here,</a> and I won't link it but if you search "final girl" on the Forge you'll find a couple posts of design noodling.<br/><br/>If you know the rules I bet you could play with 8 people in 2.5 hours. At cons with like 5 people I've run two sessions back to back in a 4 hour slot.<br/><br/>The book is short! Like 32 pages. You probably should read the whole book but the rules are pretty easy.<br/><br/>Play aids and character sheets aren't really necessary. When I run it at conventions I just bring a deck of cards, some pencils, and index cards.<br/><br/>The They Live wrestling scene expansion rules will be upcoming. They'll be LARP rules, and I take no responsibility for any injuries sustained. They'll come packaged with sunglasses. (This is never happening.)<br/><br/>GMing is pretty easy. I've run this a lot at conventions, and my first game ever was with two girls who had never played a roleplaying game before. However, if you're familiar with horror games and the tropes you have a lot of material to draw on.<br/><br/>I don't have any plans for a PDF yet. This is my first go at releasing a game and I'm easing into it. I'm not saying there will never be one because I know that gets people all riled up, but I'm like just now figuring out how to put all the webcommerce pieces together so bear with me. If I did sell it as a PDF it would be like $7.<br/><br/>It will be available for sale at any convention I'm at, in my backpack.<br/><br/>And you can call me anytime, tiger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351299/#Comment_351299" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T16:01:28+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  4:01PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look behind you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351301/#Comment_351301" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T16:13:26+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  4:13PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good luck!
