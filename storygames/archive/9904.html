[Edit to add new description]<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Radiance is a narrative game with a focus on primordial storytelling. You and your friends will create vibrant exciting tales where the activities within the story push the narrative forward. You'll take a primitive stance on creating stories to immerse yourself in ways that are both natural and original. And while you're listening to your friends' narration, you'll be able to introduce disturbances which can change the plot of the story in fun and unexpected ways. Easy to learn rules and no character creation means you'll be ready to play in a few minutes</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here's the link: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/radiance-(preview)/7433528" rel="nofollow">http://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/radiance-(preview)/7433528</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know what you think.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220158/#Comment_220158" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T12:43:05+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 12:43PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, c'mon, be more excited about it!<br><br>from reading your preview i can understand what you're interested in making, but i don't know what you have made-<br>the game sounds similar to others that i enjoy, but perhaps that's just due to the fact that i don't understand it.<br>tell me more about it, won't you? i already do all the things in your preview (except for light candles) in other games.<br>why is Radiance awesome?                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220188/#Comment_220188" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T14:31:25+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  2:31PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Jackson, Radiance is awesome because it iss based on the original natural everyday kind of way we tell stories. It is primitive, simple, even a little child like. It echoes back to primitive tribal stories told around a fire. It is a game where the activities reveal the characters, and absolutely anything can be a character. Radiance is awesome because if you're playing something else, you're spending too much time in detached analytical contemplation about character motives or character psychology and not enough time immersed in the really cool world that you and your friends have created. That's right, where other games give you one measly character to control, Radiance gives you entire worlds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220201/#Comment_220201" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T15:23:30+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  3:23PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 3:27PM by jackson_tegu.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's more like it!<br><br/>activities reveal the character... do you mean activities of the players, or within the fiction? this sounds interesting.<br/><br/>without comparing it to other games (in which i spend very little time in detatched analysis, i'll admit), immersion is cool.<br/>&amp;, to be kind of snarky, i tend to play lots of games where i'm not restricted to one character's actions as my input to the fiction.<br/><br/>but! i am interested in how you think primitive people used to tell stories, and how you would mimic that in a game / experience.<br/><br/>and anything being a character sounds like fun.<br/><br/>i have an idea now of what one can do in the context of playing the game- but give me some details about<br/>what we actually do when playing Radiance, like, what are we, the players doing to achieve these ends?<br/>who invents what when, when can i speak, when can i listen?<br/>do we involve dice or cards?<br/>tell me more!                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220247/#Comment_220247" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T02:20:48+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  2:20AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2009 2:22AM by MJGraham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The activities within the story reveal the characters. As in real life, if you want to bestow character to something, you look at what it is doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadiance is primitive because its based on animism and contains ritualistic behaviour. The first of which is experience through the notion that anything can be a character and the belief that world has precedence over persons. The latter through the lighting of candles at specific moments to signify the crossing of metaphysical thresholds (much in the way that shamans enter trances with the aid of dancing, sleep deprivation, drumming, or hallucinogens or people become married by saying I do and signing a piece of paper).<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the game you will narrate activities in the story. You'll be able to consult with your audience (the other narrators) and if all is going as it should be, you won't have to roll a single dice. But if they want to introduce a disturbance to the story, something that will distract, impede, halt, corrupt or divert the progress of the activity you're narrating, you'll have the choice of accepting the disturbance or rolling dice to narrate how  the activity overcame it. Once you're through narrating the activity, its time for the person to your left to decide the next activity in the story and narrate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
