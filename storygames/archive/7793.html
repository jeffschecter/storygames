Races, monsters, and so on - 4e art sucks, so I'm just boiling them down to stats.<br/>I'm not shying away from racism or the morality of war as issues in the game.  <br/>There's a little splash of Battlestar Galactica in there, with a "pilot episode" we'll all work together on at the first session.<br/>Unambiguously evil forces are at work from several directions, some of which are probably better as allies than enemies.<br/>There's a huge, dangerous environment to explore, and the nicest people out there are all sworn to kill you.<br/><br/>Desperation and violence are the order of the day.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172792/#Comment_172792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T08:40:42+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  8:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are there swinging rope bridges?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just watched Pirates: Dead Man's Chest, and I keep wondering how to translate that runaway water-wheel that people sword-fight on into the tactical language of D&amp;D.;  Maybe each round you're pushed toward the lead edge of the water-wheel (if on top) of the trailing edge (if on the bottom of the inside).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo translate from Tony-Talk:  D&amp;D; is a very tactically crunchy game.
