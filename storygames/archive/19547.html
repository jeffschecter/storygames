Implicit behind this doodling is the notion that the primary motivations of most players (and the means to satify those motivations) can be abstracted down to a brief objective summary. <br/><br/>At the same time last night, while not particualrly paying attention to it, I was running the <i>Vampires in Venice</i> episode of Doctor Who. Then this bit of (paraphrased) dialogue happened: "you're dangerous, and you don't even see it. Because the people around you, they're amazed by you ... so they want to impress you, so they do dangerous things ..."<br/><br/>Well, that was apt timing. Taken in the context I was thinking, that line made me realize that, in addition to desire for challenge, drama and versimultude, "Impressing the GM" is a very common motivation among players, one I haven't seen explicitly acknowledged before. And I don't mean "play impressiveliy, in order to make the whole experience more impressive," I mean "Jacqeline's a cool person, I want her to think I'm cool to." <br/><br/>I think everyone in this community is aware that many designers (which is the name-level for the GM class) develop cults of personality, without necessarily meamning to. On a more local scale, I can easily think of a dozen or so GM's who pull players just by name recognition (something I must grudgingly admit to benefitting from myself). Even in the most basic scale, the-guy-who-gets-the-game-together has heightened status. Yes, even in a GM-less/GM-ful game, if you're the person who got things organized, you're effectively the GM, you're the alpha of the group and people want to please you.<br/><br/>So ... this dynamic isn't openly acknowledged as far as I know. Most theoretical constructs addressing player motivation assume a socially egalitarian context, or even actively promote a non-hierarchial model. But thinking it over, "the player wants to impress the GM" explains a lot of table dynamics. Crazy? Just plain wrong? Prophetic insight?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434516/#Comment_434516" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T13:43:32+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  1:43PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting!<br/><br/>My initial reactions:<br/><br/>1. I can't particularly remember seeing this, except at a couple of games where there were new players at the table (RPG virgins, in other words) and they were trying to make sure they "fit in". They pretty clearly looked to the GM for validation and guidance each step of the way.<br/><br/>But, normally, I haven't particularly seen this. Can you relate an example, perhaps?<br/><br/>2. It's notable that GNS/the Big Model very specifically omits this kind of thing from Creative Agenda. The "creative" part of the term is key, here: sure, people play games for all kinds of social reasons, but the Creative Agenda (in the Big Model) is a very specific thing which is about the game itself - the social environment takes place at a level higher, and the concept of Creative Agenda is a more specific thing which doesn't include such dynamics. (So that's why you wouldn't find this kind of discussion in a Creative Agenda talk.)<br/><br/>I see GDS the same way; but I wasn't one of the people involved when it was formulated, so I don't know if that's accurate (I suspect it may involve such things much more directly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434519/#Comment_434519" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T16:08:35+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  4:08PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2014 4:44PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do see this, and it happens in many different ways.  Could be about speaking in character, could be about adding cool details, could be about giving other players hooks, or linking your story to the world in an unexpected way, etc, with a knowing or questioning glance at the GM.  Newbies do it more, but it's not always just newbies.  Sometimes it feels like "Is it ok if I do that?" or "Is that good?" (more from newbies) and other times it's more like "Yeah baybee, eat THAT!" (more from experienced players).  I think everybody loves to make the GM go "THAT was fucking awesome."  It may be due to the GM's status as a "famous" GM or whatever, it may be just the GM's status at the table or as the host, but/also/sometimes simply because everyone knows the GM has seen an awful lot of stuff happen in games, so if the GM thinks what you just did was awesome, then yeah, it WAS.<br/><br/>Here's another version: Players can suggest something that's SO unexpected it literally makes me pause the game for a minute to figure out something I (and the game's authors) never imagined.  At these moments I must "read the system's mind" because there's nothing in the rules or in the module to cover what has just been suggested.  Usually when this happens, the results are highly dramatic and often turn things in the PCs favor (because that's generally why they suggested it, to overcome some adversity in the fiction).  To see me speechless is pretty rare.  Plus I get this look on my face I've been told is very amusing.  Once the players figure this out, a new tactic enters their toolbox.  It even has a name: they call it "Stump the GM".<br/><br/>I don't think there's any actual gaming term for wanting to impress someone, though, regardless of reason.  <br/>It's kinda more general psychology, innit?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434520/#Comment_434520" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T17:01:08+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  5:01PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2014 5:02PM by E.T.Smith.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>But, normally, I haven't particularly seen this.

I can't think of a clear full-narrative example to highlight it, but its definitely something I've seen in a lot of little instances and attitudes.

It might have changed in the intervening decade, but sounds like it hasn't. It may be useful thinking of creative agenda less like a plan and more as a shared fictional aesthetic - a common set of value judgements used to agree on what is relevant or interesting in the fiction. There is a whole level where a particular aesthetic is communicated and refined over play which is really fascinating, but are really outside of theories like GNS.<br/><br/>*I was asking about a player whose goal is to make one or more other players happy.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434524/#Comment_434524" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T18:24:53+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  6:24PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's more at the Social (i.e. functional) level of the Big Model rather than the GNS (i.e. broken) level of the Big Model, yeah.

You can't get into the core of play without going /through/ Social Contract. As you say, gaming is overwhelmingly social, and the Big Model maps this perfectly. <br/><br/>"Impressing the GM" just isn't a Creative Agenda. It's a Social Agenda, sitting in the Social Contract layer. Also remember that the Big Model is a model of /play/, not of player preference. In fact, it's a model of play of a whole group over a whole instance of play, so it's better at looking at whole play sessions (and all the players' inputs) and not just one player's input. <br/><br/>In this case, I'd use the Big Model to say, "Hey, something wonky happened in last night's session; I think Bob was trying to impress the GM, and that was really limiting his creative input into the game, and therefore he wasn't pushing for the same things we all were. If we were firing on all six cylinders, we'd have had a rocking Right to Dream game, but Bob's cylinder was out of sync, and the puttering motor just didn't do it for me."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434605/#Comment_434605" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T10:14:22+00:00" title="June 30, 2014 10:14AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2014 10:24AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly.<br/><br/>(Note that Adam was responding to E.T. above, not me. I pretty much said the same thing. EDIT: Now fixed.)<br/><br/>The Social layer (as JD says) is probably the most useful and important part of the RPG theory, and includes stuff like people trying to impress each other. But it's a more basic level than the Creative Agenda level of the model, which is subsumed within the Social level.<br/><br/>So, for instance, you might be in a group that has a very functional Social level and gets together to play a game - and, of course, the Social level can't "not exist": it's always there - but they fail to find any kind of common Creative Agenda. So we can talk about their Social Contract and interactions, but the Creative Agenda effectively never materialized.<br/><br/>As for people impressing the GM in the instances being described, I've certainly seen THAT, but I've never seen it as a GM-specific thing. Generally people, IME, are trying to impress the whole group (particularly if they're new to it) or to impress a specific person who is seen as having the most experience or clout or whatever* (who may or may not be the GM).<br/><br/>Like I said, my own experience has been that GM-specific impressing happens only in certain social environments where people are new and see the GM as the authority on whether their play is "correct" (but generally relax once they see that they've "got it"), or in groups where the GM has a different social status than everyone else. (For instance, the GM is older/more experienced/famous - in other words, the players wouldn't act the same way if their younger friend Jimmy, who's never GMed before, offered to run a game the following weekend.)<br/><br/><br/>*: Like romantic interest, as JD points out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434611/#Comment_434611" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T11:04:54+00:00" title="June 30, 2014 11:04AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Like I said, my own experience has been that GM-specific impressing happens only in certain social environments where people are new and see the GM as the authority on whether their play is "correct"...</blockquote>\n... or where they are getting XP or a bonus for acting in a certain way that is being judged by someone else.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434612/#Comment_434612" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T11:13:19+00:00" title="June 30, 2014 11:13AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah...Primetime Adventures has that right up front with fanmail.

Notwithstanding what I said above, this question can be turned around.  When running a brand-new group for the first time I can only say I'm trying to impress them, because I want to make sure they enjoy the experience enough to continue doing it.  Getting all anal about my prep list, facilitating the session with extra-keen social awareness, running a game with lots of neat visuals and a strong mood, trying to make them feel as comfortable as possible, etc.  It's a little like an audition, or a first date.  Food? Check. Drinks? Check. Comfy underbutt surfaces? Check.  Printouts, character sheets, maps, music, dice set out around the table, etc.  In early sessions with a new group you might find yourself pulling all your tricks out of the box in rapid succession, like some sort of RPG Carrot Top.  <br/><br/>I think it might be easier to talk about how GMs try to impress Players than the other way around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434679/#Comment_434679" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T01:12:35+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  1:12AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2014 1:13AM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now when you mention it.
