It won a lot of awards and garnered its maker attention he used to spin off from <a href="http://www.hustlervideo.com/" rel="nofollow">Hustler Video</a>, the financiers/distrubutors of <i>Squealer</i>, and do his own thing.  A number of people call the subsequent movement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_porn" rel="nofollow">alt porn</a>, but that's a discussion for another post.<br/><br/>At any rate, some have labeled <i>Squealer</i> "horror porn," but that's really a misnomer.  There's nothing horrific about the movie, despite the vibe one might get from the box.  Rather, the director used the atmosphere and appearance of rural horror films and stories to dress up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdsm" rel="nofollow">BDSM</a> scenes that incorporate no violence or gore, implied or explicit.  It's no more <i>real</i> than "teacher/student" BDSM scenes or "naughty priest" scenes are <i>real</i> executions of child molestation or the like, but <i>virtually real</i> as a construct within which power exchange and sexual conduct take place.<br/><br/>What does this have to do with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game" rel="nofollow">roleplaying</a>?  Everything and nothing.  For some time I've kicked around the idea of using <i>Squealer</i> as a model for an online roleplaying exercise, either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBEM" rel="nofollow">PBeM</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-post_role-playing_game" rel="nofollow">PBP</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBW#Play-by-wiki" rel="nofollow">PBW</a>.  Not as an exercise in interactive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotica" rel="nofollow">erotica</a> <i>per se</i>, but as a vehicle for exploring character and various related headspace issues.  Like <i>Squealer</i>, which uses rural horror trappings as a kind of visual grammar within which sex transpires, the game would use both the horror <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_%28narrative%29" rel="nofollow">motif</a> <i>and</i> sex as the framework for an examination of character.<br/><br/><i>More <a href="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/2007/10/06/squeal-all-you-want/" rel="nofollow">here</a>....</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103693/#Comment_103693" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T11:20:59+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 11:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yow!

I thought it was a shame you felt you had to diverge from the thrust (ahem) of the post and discuss BDSM and how it's really ok and not abusive, and how the depraved shouldn't apply. That's like prefacing Monopoly with well-meaning and apologetic refutations of capitalism.<br/><br/>Running a game with a central sexual theme - as you say, using sex as a way to explore character - is not something I've seen. I've run and played in games with sexual scenes and themes of lust, marriage, commitment, desire. These elements evolved. But I would love to play a game where the sexual side was specifically central. Where the three or four defining questions on the character sheet concerned desire, need, kink or experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103745/#Comment_103745" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T15:23:36+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  3:23PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, where to start. You post brings up a lot of issues and all of them won't fit together so nicely. I'll start somewhere in middle and hope the post will come out right in the end.<br/><br/>1. About finding players. You talk a lot about the problem of finding willing players and what might be the problem with the players you get. This is a general problem for roleplaying. As soon as you go outside a a certain group of people with a certain amount of shared habits and values regarding play the problems might be just insurmountable. I mean. one of the big things with the indie rpg movement is that they try to learn people how to view rpgs in a new way. The reason why the larp culture is so different between different countries is this: when a certain larp culture is established it is very hard to introduce larps from other larp cultures since the agreed upon habits and allowed subjects of play are so different. In Nordic non-fantasy larp it would be normal to explore subjects like child abuse and incest without more work than otherwise, while I think this woul require much more preparation in most other larp cultures, since these subjects aren't normally seen as kosher (this is my view, based on what I have read, please correct me if I'm wrong).<br/><br/>But, again about players in your game. You really can't expect good results in a game like this by choosing players that you don't know! I mean, don't even try! Choose people that you either know very well from your ordinary life or choose people who you have seen at forums a lot and have respect for. If you find such people, who also are engaged in you idea I guess you will have a good chance of success.<br/><br/>2. Games and sex. I have seen very little good treatment of sex in rpg (I do count larp as rpg, maybe this will be seen as strange by some people, but I can't have my head make a strict distinction) and Iwould like to see more, but I also acknowledge the problems it brings. There are of course a lot of S/M roleplay, (which I honestly know almost nothing about) which probably could be seen as a sort of larp. But I think we all recognize the difference between porn and a story where sex is an important part of character and plot. A couple of years ago I read about a Dutch sex-larp, which was heavily geared towards actual sex between players, but they did a lot of pre-game work to ensure that it would be a larp rather than a just an orgy. Probably it was a bit of both, but the text I read was from one who seemed to have been touched deeply by his character. He had arrived there with heterosexual, but with a character that was a bit ambiguous and ended up being involved only in homosexual activities. (I should add that they also had agreements on how to let the characters have sex, without the players being involved. Those things were decided in the actual situation.)<br/><br/>3. But finally, if your interest is exploring character from a sexual point of view I don't really understand you choice of inspiration. I have never heard of the movie, but I followed your links and the movie is obviously a rather standard porn production, albeit with a rather more extreem theme. I don't really understand what part of the theme it is you want to bring into a game. It would be interesting to hear some clarifications on that.<br/><br/>I think generally that if you want to make a story based in sex, but about a set of people it's a good idea not to choose setting and topic after what any given player find sexualy interesting. I'm thinking partly about Shortbus, which is an excellent movie with not too little sex in front of the camera. But it's also a movie that is very careful not to function as porn. I truly liked the movie and got really invested in the characters, (although it is true that the characters are better than the plot; especially one of the plot lines just didn't work, at least not for me) but there was not a second of sexual excitement on my part. Which I definitely see not as a feature in itself, but a way of making the movie work as intended. <br/><br/>For me it would make much more sense to use a setting like that of Shortbus (a club for people with different tastes in life, including sex) or almost any ordinary relationship to view characters in the light of sexuality. Your vision seem like a trickier one and to me less appealing. Am I missing something? It would also be interesting to hear a clarification of the idea of the game. Would the characters be engaging in BDSM or would they be engaged in a situation which might be described by the fictional layer in BDSM, that is in real abuse?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103756/#Comment_103756" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T16:32:38+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  4:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sexually-focused RP is very, very common in chat-based forums and even some PbP areas (see literotica's boards).

Just like the rural horror motif.  It's all trappings, as opposed to the focus.  The focus is on internal space.  The chrome sells the car, in other words.  Chrome is cool, but it doesn't affect core performance.<br/><br/>At any rate, I mention at the very tail end of the post the idea that one could substitute violence for sex and get the same essential result.  Both are violative, though in the case of being stabbed to death (or whatever) there's little variety in terms of endgame.<br/><br/>It occurred to me today that <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=18732&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">the farm</a> kinda-sorta covers similar territory, though butchery and not sex is on the agenda there.

Those folks who don't watch a lot of porn tend to think that's the case anyway, but it's not; while the focus is on the women, the men <i>are</i> people and are portrayed as equal participants.<br/><br/>Rendering the men literally faceless increases the perceived threat from them without changing the dynamics of the scene in any mechanical way (if that makes sense).  It also puts all, or nearly all, the focus on the women, which is one of the elements that got me thinking about how this would be actualized as a headspace kind of game where the revelatory aspect of play would be internal, or character-based, rather than in the sex itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103799/#Comment_103799" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T05:43:44+00:00" title="October 19, 2007  5:43AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2007 7:21AM by Southpaw.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>What sort of system and what sort of focus do you see?

The abduction/sex scenario is just a framework, as would any fantasy-based BDSM scene and doesn't necessarily constitute an endorsement of actual sexual abuse.<br/><br/>Anyway, I started thinking about this after watching watching <i>Squealer</i> (natch).  It occurred to me that reviewers responded to the rural horror <i>motif</i> more strongly than the situation seemed to warrant, especially since sex was substituted in those places where torture and/or murder would appear in a straight-up horror movie.  So, I wondered, what was the same?<br/><br/>The men are deprived of identity, just as the killers in many horror movies are hidden behind masks or otherwise rendered blank.  So the focus is clearly on the victims.  Any story one might tell in such a situation, particularly in a roleplaying scenario, would necessarily <i>also</i> focus on the victims.  Sex and violence are therefore interchangable elements, while psychological issues stemming from confinement, torment and/or exploitation remain a constant.<br/><br/>One could easily grab a system like <i>Blood</i> and reenact the sort of thing depicted in the <i>Saw</i> films and get more or less the same result.  As I said, some of the character touchstones explored by a game like <i>the farm</i> might be very similar to what I'm thinking about here.  From my perspective, though, I'm less comfortable with out-and-out violence of this sort than I am with sex, which is kind of a reversal of most folks.<br/><br/>I went back and forth for the better part of an hour about whether I'd even cross-post this idea here. Roleplayers in general (and some people) react very strangely to sex and/or sex in games. From a roleplaying standpoint it's either drooling, goofy and borderline offensive drivel like <i>FATAL</i> -- and I include dross like <i>The Book of Erotic Fantasy</i> in that assessment, as well -- or it's absent entirely. As a group roleplayers seem far more comfortable with violence than they are with sex. I'm not sure what that says about us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105634/#Comment_105634" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T06:08:00+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  6:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most Americans are more comfortable with violence than sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's funny, but one of the other first places I commentd here discussed Closetland (movie) as a basis for a game. I believe the term "Stockholm Syndrome" came up. I think that would be a fascinating subject for a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say, strangely or maybe not, I would be much more comfortable in a game that explored the "nice" themes of BDSM like trust, gifting of power, and vulnerability than I would in a game that was about a serial killerish inhumanity. I'll admit it, The Farm scares the bejesus out of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to think of it, I wish I had a copy.

The biggest determents seem to be risk of physical harm (i.e. Gamists "losing the game") or police attention (i.e. disruption of the Narrative). So I tried something different. Mechanically, every hit in the game succeeds, and every attack kills the first time. You are completely invulnerable to physical damage as well; there's no mechanics for even being attacked, hurt, stunned, or hindered physically in any way.<br/><br/>Instead, your character (for reasons that will make more sense when you see a finished outcome) is an absolute emotional wreck, and each roll in combat tests for how well you can cope with the inhuman things you do in the setting. So, killing without consequence is mechanically supported; but inner turmoil makes every Big Decision only matter in headspace. The game is all about exploring innerspace of the mind; it's perhaps a little presumptuous of me, but when I get a finished product out, I think that substituting violence for sex would make the system a very cerebral choice for what you're mentioning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105909/#Comment_105909" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T08:42:53+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  8:42AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>I've noticed how comfortable players are with violence in RPGs, even in modern settings with modern themes.</blockquote>\nExactly.

There's definitely a perspective issue at play, and I say this while not denigrating that kind of scenario.<br/><br/>As I stated in my blog post, I'm as attached to old-school RPing as the next guy and have certainly killed people and taken their stuff many, many times.  I'm sure I will again, as far as that goes, but I'm struck by the reaction of people I've shared the idea with outside this venue.  These reactions run from "That's... weird," to "You sick fuck!"

Your characters can believe whatever they want, but Brooklyn still sucks, and you're the closest thing anyone'll ever see to a monster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111449/#Comment_111449" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T17:22:13+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  5:22PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is gonna come from waaaaaay left field, but I spent a fair amount of time cruising irc for "scenes" and it's very much roleplaying.
