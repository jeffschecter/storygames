                            Right — the way I was taught it is “a sentence has two parts: the subject and the predicate”. So it’s everything that’s not the subject.<br/><br/>How is it used in RPGs? These days I only hear the word in the formal-logic sense of “a function returning true or false”, as I’m a programmer...                        </div>

                            It's not common theory jargon, but if I understand Sandra correctly, the old Forge-speak (via Vincent) for her "predicate" would be "elements of exploration" and "fictional positioning". It's basically an attempt at rigorous description of the internal structure of a given fiction. Specifically, you'll note that predicate relationships are the natural way for distinct fictional elements to exhaustively relate to each other nearly always in roleplaying.<br/><br/>I like to speak of "qualities" myself, specifically "qualitative systematization" when it comes to using game mechanics that specifically rely on assigning and manipulating predicates. This contrasts with "quantitative systems" that concern themselves with relative scales of fixed attributes. While qualitative structuration is natural for storytelling and therefore roleplaying, quantitative systematization is something that rather took over roleplaying through the '80s, with consequences that we see to this day.<br/><br/>Sandra's adventures in D&amp;D combat mechanics are, from this perspective, best understood as her being dissatisfied with quantitative mechanics, which she replaces with qualitative ones. I'm still waiting for her to replace hit points with qualitative wound markers, though [grin].                        </div>

                            It is all the same thing, is it not?<br/><br/>It's a somewhat subtle theoretical concept in that there's nothing inherently <i>special</i> about any qualitative declaration that a player in a roleplaying game makes; as I mentioned, this is the normal way that verbal storytelling inherently structures things. "The room <b>is small</b>" and "the monster <b>is horrible</b>". It would be justified to say that this is how humans think, we don't really go "the room is 3.4 meters long", that's not how we work cognitively.<br/><br/>However, take an actual roleplaying game that <i>uses this phenomenon in its mechanics</i>, and qualitative thinking starts to look quite revolutionary compared to how a traditional game tries to subsume the predicate logic into a non-relational word-picture. Roleplaying has a solid heritage in quantitative simulation thinking, starting with the original wargaming culture and continuing with the '80s universal simulation era. Asking "how much?" is built into everything, and asking "what is the case?" is often sidelined by game mechanics heavily, leaving that part entirely freeform.<br/><br/>I understand that a key reason for why people respond emotionally to the Apocalypse World mechanics is that it's all so qualitative. What you say either <i>is</i> a move or it's <i>not</i>, there's no murky GM interpretation layer subsuming the qualitative gear shifts. Same for e.g. Fate, and more generally the first cycle of Forgite stuff in the mid-'00s.                        </div>

                            Ah, that's an interesting idea. Perhaps so! I absolutely agree with the idea that the traditional roleplaying game is forced to do a lot of busywork in converting the narrative predicate into a quantity. Just look at the mess of tables in <i>Chainmail</i>, how it needs to know what "light infantry vs. heavy infantry" means in numeric terms to have anything actionable. As far as D&amp;D is concerned "wearing plate mail" is not even a predicate, it's just a colorfully encoded number (AC = 2, to be specific).<br/><br/>I've always thought of it as an "engineering bias" arising from the college scene that defined early roleplaying. Starting with Gary Gygax and continuing until the late '80s, what I see in roleplaying is that the dominant game texts are written like auto repair manuals, by people who are clearly comfortable with a certain kind of quantifying viewpoint. It's often termed a hankering for "world simulation". The real reason for why Vampire and such were considered transgressive in their time was in abandoning this wargamey, physical sciences bias in favour of artsy-fartsy humanistic perspectives.<br/><br/>Like, the D&amp;D Fireball, how it works and where it lives in its natural context: the idea that the wizard controls the primeval force of flame (the predicate: "I am <b>in control of flame</b>") is at best a side note, the real matters of interest are how large the explosion is (and how you'd calculate its shape deformation in a narrow tunnel) and how much damage it causes, expressed quantitatively. It's a peculiarity of the roleplaying condition, a cultural feature that is far from obvious outside the subculture. It wouldn't occur to e.g. a comic book author to approach the Human Torch's flame powers in the way the traditional roleplaying game defines the wizard's mastery over the same element.                        </div>

I already have! Instead of meat points, you take damage in the form of rolls on the lingering injury table and death save failures.<br/><br/>Hit points instead are some sorta weird action econ adjacent thing where you pay hit points to diegetically negate hits (if you can; sometimes you're just out-maneuvered in the diegesis).                        </div>

                            Spent all my life looking for games that had actual rules for the GM to follow. That's why I latched on to Everway [compared to that crap game Drakar 91] because it had the three principles fortune drama karma. Unfortunately those three principles ended up amounting to "do w/e you want" in practice so that was not good. Then Three Sixteen and Dogs in the Vineyard. Finally the OSR. [Kinda dodged the PbtA bullet by getting into OSR juuuust before PbtA hit big.]                        </div>

                            You mean like playing the Ryuujin? No, that's not what I mean. I mean something more like Moldvay basic where it tells you how to build the game location [in a much more detailed &amp; playable way than Ryuutama's sparse town&amp;world sheets], and how to run the game [the turn / round structure in Moldvay]. How to set up a good porte-monstre-trésor; place/problem/goal.                        </div>
