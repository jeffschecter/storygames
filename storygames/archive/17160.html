My Uncle made Skeetch the Omniscient Octopoid, a tentacled being who could make himself 2D and see all over with a bunch of eyeballs. Since we were just testing the rules, he was the only player.<br/><br/>During character creation, we couldn't figure out: Are there 4 super powers with 1d8 each, 2 with 2d8, or does it not matter?<br/><br/>I rolled up a netherworld marauder, so I first came up with a giant sludge/ooze that was slowly consuming rocket city. We decided it didn't make much sense by itself, so it must have been controlled by Dr Xxxxx, a being with a brain so large, he had to fly around in a gravity sphere. <br/><br/>The rules said we needed 2 more threats, so we added a robot army, and then... more robot army. I didn't realize that you don't really put all the main threats of the game in the first scene. <br/><br/>The game started, we misread the rules and never got rid of threat dice after rolling them. Needless to say Skeetch was hopelessly outclassed. Once we figured the rule out he did better, and ended up capturing Dr Xxxxxx and luring the ooze into the martian ocean. <br/><br/>I only realize after I went home that you're supposed to play more than one scene. I think the pocket rules are a little light on this fact. I had to go back and read the beta carefully to figure out what I think is the recommendation for pocket: You have have several scenes, each one can be bordered by some generic story/roleplaying stuff without rolling. Then you throw in another scene. Is that how you do it? The beta talks about other kinds of scenes, where you still roll, but i'm not sure how I'd pull that off. Let's say the players finish a scene, and they need to figure out how to defeat something big / invincible. How would you do that?<br/><br/>The second game went a lot better, from a rules perspective. I had two players: Doctor Elastic (a robot like Inspector Gadget) and The Zapper, an alien with lots of electricity and teleport. <br/><br/>They were giving a speech on Central Floating Park, when a vortex opened up and things started getting sucked in. This time, I didn't add the "behind the scenes" threats, just the vortex, a plague of nanobot flies, some in-danger citizens, and a big claw arm dragging things into the hole. It worked well, with the characters struggling to save things before the danger meter got to 10. They both ended up getting sucked into the vortex (can't ignore those complications!), and we were in the mood to play some video games so we ended it there. If I had another scene, I would have had them figure out a little more of the background, fight some more stuff, until they finally confronted the major villain or something. <br/><br/>So, is the number of scenes up to GM fiat, like a "normal" game? The threats *in* a scene are very controlled, so I felt like the rules were supposed to provide more guidelines on this. (It feels like cheating: I can only put 5 threats per scene, but I can have as many scenes as I want! Bwa ha ha)<br/><br/>Overall, it was surprisingly fun. Most story games I've played that control narration like this get in the way of my creativity, but I felt like this really enhanced it and flowed well. Thanks for such a great game!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/seanhess" title="seanhess"><img alt="seanhess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/seanhess">seanhess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389424/#Comment_389424" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T12:06:48+00:00" title="September  6, 2012 12:06PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Bump* Here's a summary of my questions:<br/><br/>During character creation, we couldn't figure out: Are there 4 super powers with 1d8 each, 2 with 2d8, or does it not matter?<br/><br/>Is there any limit to the number of scenes?

And they could be anything - powers, gear, contacts, assistants, cybernetic replacements, magic, vehicles, weapons, secrets man-was-not-meant-to-know, etc.<br/><br/>For scenes, at least with the new Pocket Danger Patrol, I don't think John had any scene limits in mind, and the number of threats, I believe, is really a suggestion. Want it to be easier? Don't have as many. Want it to be harder? Add in some more, or give them more weird abilities.<br/>And you pretty much just play until you feel you're at a good conclusion, or have destroyed the city, or been crushed by the enemy, or what have you. Or even just end it in a cliffhanger, and say TO BE CONTINUED...when you think you've reached your DangerPatrol limit for the evening.<br/>At least for that, you may want to look at the two earlier incarnations of DangerPatrol for some scene-related ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389697/#Comment_389697" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T14:13:20+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  2:13PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the delay, just saw this thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Looks like Michael covered the answers. The game is still not quite at 100%, so these kind of things crop up for everyone in play. I really appreciate the report and feedback which will help me continue to dial in the system and rules.
