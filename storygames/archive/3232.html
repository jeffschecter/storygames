Urge the players to tie themselves to one another by Keys when creating their characters.  This is super crucial!  If they don't, encourage them to do it in play by suggesting likely relationships that are developing.  <br/><br/>2.  I get everybody's Keys together (and, to a lesser extent, Secrets) and figure out ways to strongly invoke at least one per player per session.  Preferably more than one.  Somebody took Conscience?  Dude, you are on a <i>slave ship.</i> Bloodlust?  Dude, <i>evil pirates. </i> That sort of thing. <br/><br/>3.  Ask them what they want to see.  Ask them for set pieces they want.  "I want a kraken!" - give them a kraken, for Pete's sake, maybe in some surprising context.  Ask for general motifs and singular images, too.  <br/><br/>4.  Don't forget that you get Key scenes of your own, so think up some cool-ass stuff that <i>you </i>want to play.  Also spend a little time thinking about likely pool refresh circumstances, and think up some colorful people and places for those.  <br/><br/>5.  Remember that TSOY is all about the relationships, not about killing the bad guys.  Bad guys are easy.  Don't be shy about forming relationships and pushing hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73520/#Comment_73520" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T04:38:57+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  4:38AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah, i was really a taskmaster about the "players must have relationships thing".  i think it worked out!  thanks for the advice Jason.  <br/>so reaccurring Bad Guys don't need Keys?   they get Secrets though, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73522/#Comment_73522" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T04:52:15+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  4:52AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right!

Once an NPC has "Key of Unrequited Love" for one of the PCs you just know that it is so ON. And yeah, we went ahead and gave the NPC the XP awards and everything. This technique was stolen from <i>Nine Worlds</i> in which you make an NPC and then after she's introduced, she gets to win points and "level up" and everything, like a PC.

It's harder to hit Keys pointed at each other from a remove.  So making one character an antagonist is probably not the best move for your first crack at the game, in my opinion.  But it's a fun idea, and it could work - it's just a lot more complex than a bunch of guys fighting crime together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73977/#Comment_73977" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T10:39:04+00:00" title="June  6, 2007 10:39AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2007 5:04PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            do you have any advice on handling precognitive powers like the Slave's "speak with dead?".  the in-game effects are kinda easy to get at(just kinda feel it out), but what should the game mechanic's effects be.  a bonus die to a Reason-based Ability?  how do you handle things like mind reading and precognition?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73989/#Comment_73989" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T11:23:16+00:00" title="June  6, 2007 11:23AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think they've come up.

You'll note that many of our Keys and Secrets are just retoolings of others to make them setting specific.<br/><br/>As for "Keys for NPCs" I think that while NPCs don't really need Keys per se, they absolutely need motivations.  Every good character <i>wants</i> something, whether it's the love of a PC, world domination, or whatever.  You can easily use Keys to help shape motivations, but it's not necessary to keep track of their experience and advances.  At least not in my experience.<br/><br/>We actually have had the "speak with dead" bit come up in our current game, but the PC who has the "Secret of the Spirits" is pretty subtle about it.  Essentially, treat the dead as an NPC and see what kinds of information the player can get through standard social conflict resolution (using Sway, Etiquette, etc.).  I'd go for a narrative result (pointing them to a Key scene, perhaps), but you could also have a mechanical effect (bonus dice for a certain ability, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74003/#Comment_74003" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T12:04:40+00:00" title="June  6, 2007 12:04PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite precog trick is from (I think) Unknown Armies.<br/><br/>At any point during a scene, you activate your precog power and state that everything that just happened in the scene was your vision of the future. You then rewind to the beginning of the scene and play it again. It's super fun in play. You could charge a steep price for this if you think you need to... 4 Reason maybe. I would charge less simply because it's awesome and I'd like to see it happen a lot. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74314/#Comment_74314" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T19:00:26+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  7:00PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            another quick couple of questions...<br/>instead of a Key of the Sadist, could it be a Secret that maybe gives extra Hurt for a cost out of his(NPC's)Attribute Pool?<br/>sorta like a weapon, but one that costs.<br/>how do NPC's Refresh?<br/>how do you guys physically set up play? <br/>do you use different colored dice for Gift Dice?<br/>do you use stones or chips for XP's?<br/>do you use stones to keep track of Harm?<br/>i'm just wondering for when the time comes how i can set up the playing space.<br/>thanks again!<br/>oh, and do you know of any cool sources for getting names from the "age of sail"(1600's)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74319/#Comment_74319" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T19:28:08+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  7:28PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dislike Key of the Sadist.
