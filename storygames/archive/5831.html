If you win, they lose their next turn.<br/><br/><b>Fireball</b><br/>Pick an Arena you can see, and roll an attack.  This attack counts against anyone in that Arena and does 2 damage.  You can't spend Awesome tokens to hit or do more damage, but you can spend an Awesome token to miss someone in the Arena that you don't want to hit.  Once per battle you can spend your action to cast this.  <br/><br/><b>Healing</b><br/>Once per battle you can point at an ally and give them 2 Hit Points.  <br/><br/><b>Lightning</b><br/>You make one attack against an enemy, and if you hit you do 1 damage.  Then subtract 2 from your attack and pick another enemy in the same Arena.  Keep going until you miss or want to stop.  You can pick the same enemy twice.<br/><br/><b>Luck</b><br/>On your turn, you can cast this as an action by indicating who you want to use it on.  If you cast it on an ally then the next time they roll they roll twice and take the best result.  If you cast it on an enemy, they roll twice and keep the worst result.  <br/><br/><b>Magic Shield</b><br/>Once per battle you can spend your action to cast this.  The person you target gets to treat their armor as the next better kind of armor, and keeps the shield until they get hit.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130479/#Comment_130479" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T07:42:36+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  7:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2008 7:43AM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Limitation: The Sky is falling. </b><br/>You're a reverse claustrophobic.

I know I've chatted about them somewhere, but I'm not sure where.</p>\n<p>Here's the guidelines that are in my head when I'm writing talents:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Every talent must pass the First Level Test.  If this one talent was the only cool ability your character can have for an extended period of time, would it be satisfying on it's own?</li>\n<li>Talents come in two flavors:  Things that <em>you can do better</em> than everyone else and things you can do that <em>no one else can.</em>  I tried to make sure that every class had a few of each.  When I was writing up the first list of talents I tried really hard to lean on the latter.  </li>\n<li>No talent should be dependant on a situation that the player isn't going to be in control of bringing to the table.  A lot of anti-trap talents didn't make it into the game because I didn't want to assume that the GM would regularly be bringing in traps for the trap-character to use their talent on.  </li>\n<li>No time limits or limited uses.  No per day, per week, per session, per combat, per this, or per that talents.  The awesomeness of a character should be unlimited. </li>\n<li>Simpler talents are better talents.  But complex talents are ok when they aren't cluttering up the page.</li>\n<li>I like it when the most obvious combos of talents are cross-class talents.</li>\n<li>Every talent must pass the Plays Well With Others Test.  Is this talent unique enough that it wouldn't be boring to cross-class with any of the other talents?  You wouldn't want to have two talents that are effectively the same thing, and I don't want to give you that option.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I feel like there's probably more, but this is what's coming to mind right now.  Enjoy!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130653/#Comment_130653" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T16:08:23+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  4:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, those are good guidelines, and the ones I wrote above don't measure up (espeically the per-battle / per day thing, most obviously).  <br/><br/>I was only guided by "try to express Dungeon Squad spell design in Red Box Hack language."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130655/#Comment_130655" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T16:22:47+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  4:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>That's cool.

But it was Mark who wrote the guidelines, not you, it turns out:\n<blockquote><br/>In this design, I wholeheartedly embrace the ethic that Class Abilities are things that no one else is able to do (instead of doing the things that everyone can do but better). I think that these areas of 'breaking the rules' are the grabby parts of the system. By defining them, you not only remind people of what the rules ARE but also what they could do differently.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean, however, that there can't be some formula for defining the Classes - at least, not in my mind.<br/><br/>Here's the rubric I think I'd use at this point to create a Class:<br/><br/>1 One Ability that alters the Rules Drastically<br/>2 One Ability that works with the Weapons Rules<br/>3 One Ability that works with the Arenas Rules<br/>4-5 Two Abilities that increases the Flavor of the Class<br/><br/>I'll come back later with an example of how I'd rework one of the Classes with this model (or simply demonstrate its efficacy).<br/></blockquote>\n<img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
