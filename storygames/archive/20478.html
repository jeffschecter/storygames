If you are an expert of American Football (I'm not) translating the sport to the game's rules should be easy, but you might not like the result. Let's make an example with a common and often decisive "move": passing the ball forward.<br/><br/>In a system that allows tests with gradual degrees of success (e.g. how many point you roll above a threshold) passing the ball might require a roll of dexterity (or throwing football skill) for the thrower, determining (with the help of some little formula or table) how far the ball scatters away from its intended destination in a completely random direction, and the receiver would then make a roll of dexterity (or catching football skill) with a difficulty that ranges from automatic to impossible depending on the ball's position (another little table). Arid but dependable, and easy to optimize for realism. <br/><br/>Some RPGs might allow the player to spend some resource to improve the odds of random tests (e.g. perversity points in <i>Paranoia XP</i>, rerolls in <i>Bloodbowl</i>, insisting at the cost of getting hurt in <i>Trollbabe</i>): what resources of this sort fit the tone and intent of your campaign? How far should such mechanics be allowed to warp realism?<br/><br/>In a PbtA variant throwing and catching the ball might be two specific moves (or a single move performed jointly by two characters), with the difficult but rewarding design task of being creative with the consequences of mediocre and failed rolls (minor injuries, penalties or bonuses to subsequent actions, etc.). It could even work without tracking player positions precisely (e.g. the thrower of an inaccurate pass decides which opponent catches the ball), which might be considered either a feature or an abomination. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450260/#Comment_450260" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-01T18:12:52+00:00" title="January  1, 2016  6:12PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If using a PbtA set of rules (2d6+adds), it could be interesting to have each player ranked -1, 0, or +1, and then have each player roll a single d6, adding their stat.

I looked heavily into Contenders, even making a translation of the main game elements and transforming the fight into a team sport. But, in the end, it is a very specific game that tells a very specific kind of story that we were not interested in.<br/><br/>Addressing the OP,s question, it really depends on what game you are looking to play. You said most important f the "dice rolling" would be done outside the match. (I am not familiar with Eyeshield 21). Is it about the characters' and their personal dramas? If so, PTA would be great.<br/><br/>I never really settled on a system for the match. But, if I was sprung with the possibility of playing a sports-themed rpg right now, I would use PTA. For the match, there would be a scene (or maybe a sequence) towards the end of each episode (or however frequently we wanted it) and the outcome would be tied to the individual results he players got for their own objectives during that scene.<br/><br/>It is the match, everyone would play cards for their own individual goals. Let's say it is soccer and I have two players: both succeeded, match was won, both failed then match loss and one succeeded and one failed then draw. For football, if you have an odd number of players then you never have a draw.<br/><br/>Additionally, you could attribute a weight to each player's success to the screen presence. Spotlight character succeeded, our team gets 3 points. If hat character failed, the opposing team gets the 3 points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
