Our plan is to play a complete, ten chapter game over three Monday evenings.<br/><br/>I was a little nervous playing my game with these guys.  We play every week, and we play short-form stuff, and they are all very, very good players.  Clinton and Remi make games, too.  So despite the fact that they have been with me through <i>Grey Ranks</i>\u2019 creation and even playtested a bit, this was the first time any of them got to see the final, finished game in action.  I know it doesn\u2019t suck, but I still had a little anxiety.  <br/><br/>We set up our crew without any trouble.  Joe is playing Danusia, a pious and judgmental Catholic girl.  Clinton\u2019s playing Bogus\u0142aw, an impulsive  17-year-old from a dirt poor family.  Remi is Zygmunt, a farm boy and lothario.  And I\u2019m playing Robert, who contrasts nicely with all of them \u2013 he\u2019s rich, he\u2019s a city slicker, and he\u2019s got no time for God.  The thing I hold dear is my first love, who is Remi\u2019s character, Zygmunt.  That\u2019s already proven really interesting and fun.  For some reason the gay angle gets downplayed most of the time in <i>Grey Ranks</i>.  We were happy to bring it into our game.  I mean come on, they're Boy Scouts!*<br/><br/>We talked about the likely content \u2013 anti-Semitism, fascism, children getting killed and hurt, sexual violence \u2013 and agreed that we\u2019d be open to what happened, keeping the worst of it off-screen.  We all trust each other and agreed to check in often once things got crazy in the game.  None too soon, really \u2013 in my first mission scene I outed a Jew and got him killed.  This was a harbinger of bad things for Robert, who is turning out to be a real shit-heel.  <br/><br/>There was a palpable tension as we played the days leading up to the Uprising, which was very satisfying.  Everyone really brought their best game and we pointed our characters, and various NPCs, directly at each other.  In chapter two, during the mission, I narrated a scene where I was stopped at a German checkpoint \u2013 alone but within sight and sound of my crew.  I bribed the sergeant with a thick wad of Reichsmarks.  Now Clinton had introduced the Bank of Poland as a situation element, where <i>of course </i>my father was a managing director.  So he interrupted the mission to cut in a personal scene, where Bogus\u0142aw and Robert went to visit Robert\u2019s fat-cat father and beg for a loan for Bogus\u0142aw\u2019s impoverished family.  He failed, my guy\u2019s dad became this towering asshole we\u2019ll definitely meet again, and he handed Robert a fat wad of Reichsmarks \u201cto spend on something nice.\u201d  So wham!  Back to the mission, here\u2019s Bogus\u0142aw watching me give away the money that would have turned his family\u2019s water back on.  Really cool.  That\u2019s how the game\u2019s supposed to work.<br/><br/>The game\u2019s opening, which is entirely freeform, was a little rocky, but it always is.  Once we\u2019d nailed down our reputations it really caught fire.  Three chapters in, and Joe\u2019s already invoked Danusia\u2019s thing held dear.  My guy Robert (thanks to mission leader Clinton, getting revenge for the Deutschmark thing with my wholehearted support) has already visited the nervous breakdown corner.   We\u2019re all super excited to play again, and now that the difficulty is ramping up we can all start to see trajectories for our characters.<br/><br/>*amusing anecdote:  The very first version of <i>Grey Ranks</i> mechanically mandated heterosexual relationships.  The boy/girl thing was hard-coded in for some reason.  It was a contest entry, and Luke Crane's first comment was "what about gay love, dude?  You said they were Boy Scouts."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127526/#Comment_127526" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:51:20+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:51AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 6:52AM by Remi.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy cow, I really can't describe how much I enjoyed playing Grey Ranks. Like, I expected it to be emotionally affecting, and to be an interesting experience, but man, I got to <i>bring my game</i>. Full-court, no-holds-barred, blitzkrieg game.<br/><br/>There were so many great moments in this game. German station guards forcing Danusia to sing Deutschland Uber Alles in front of her shocked friends. Zigmunt bullying Robert into drinking more 'courage' before visiting a 'patriotic' whore.<br/><br/>At one point Boguslav saved Danusia from a drunken artilleryman, he said, "There are Germans everywhere!" and I immediately jumped in with that line, but this time we were shouting it while on a mission to deliver food and water to a Home Army squad pinned down in a school house by an MG-42. Those movements of scene seemed really natural and added a velocity to the game that I haven't felt in a long time.<br/><br/>And playing the Grid totally adds to the game. We haven't had to make really hard choices yet, but we've definitely made choices in the course of the game, all influenced by The Grid. Joe bringing Danusia's Thing Held Dear in so early, man. We're all wolves licking our chops. The mechanics and economy of 2 scenes per chapter added so much to this game, on top of the really high-quality roleplaying. Every good moment lead to a better one.<br/><br/>I can barely wait until next week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127531/#Comment_127531" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:57:20+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:57AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the smash cutting between mission and personal scenes has emerged as my favorite technique after many, many games.  We had a mission scene - we're on the Gdansk station platform, it's a gusty, windy day, and we're trying to hide a bunch of anti_German leaflets under altar boy surplices without much success.  "It's too windy!" someone says, and Bam!  I interrupt and cut to a personal scene on Zygmunt's farm in 1939, and it's a blustery fall day and we're out shooting a .22 at tin cans in a crosswind.  We resolve that and bam!  We're back to Gdansk station.  There's a through-line of sense memory that's really satisfying and cool, and strong reincorporation across the game - Zygmunt's .22 returns, for example, and is going to be important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127541/#Comment_127541" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T07:21:35+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  7:21AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 7:21AM by Remi.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Jason, is smash-cutting a technique that can be easily applied to other games, or is it especially well-suited for Grey Ranks due to its subject matter and mechanical set-up?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127545/#Comment_127545" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T07:35:41+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  7:35AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 7:37AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's definitely not unique and I want to use it more often.  It'll be easier in some games - you could incorporate it easily into <i>Dogs </i>raises and sees, for example.  For a game like <i>PTA</i>, where it would be a perfect fit in terms of storytelling, I think it'd actually be harder but worth thinking about.  The rigid allocation of two different types of scenes makes it very easy in<i> Grey Ranks.</i><br/><br/>Oh, you also get this effect when you disentangle character ownership from individuals, like in jeepform.  If I can interrupt and play out a scene in the future or past, with somebody elses character currently in the spotlight, you get the same effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127645/#Comment_127645" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T11:20:11+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 11:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The 'interrupt at any time' aspect seems really, really important to facilitating the cuts and the way it heightened emotional moments and connected things together.

I guess I was thinking of framing raises and sees as flashbacks/flash forwards, but it is different.  In last night's game we had some very complex interpolation going on - all of chapter three was essentially sandwiched between two halves of a very subtle interpersonal scene, as I recall.  You couldn't do that in Dogs.  <br/><br/>And the notion of cutting abruptly at the emotional tipping point is very powerful - like when my guy offered the bribe, and we smash-cut to a scene where we learned exactly how I obtained that money and what it meant to Clinton's character to see it thrown away.  That's good stuff.<br/><br/>Darcy:  I think that's a really strong set-up, particularly if the content of that ever-elaborating scene has some sort of payoff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127670/#Comment_127670" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T11:46:06+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 11:46AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 11:46AM by Remi.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darcy, that's really powerful.

They gave a huge kick to whatever came after them and after you got a few under your belt they sketched out the life and troubles of your character really, really clearly.<br/><br/>Jason: Yeah, Chapter Two was sandwiched in between my seduction of Anna, as well.

We used the "chase" card-flipping style from the back of PTA to help facilitate this. You flip the first cards, see the "win/lose/not yet" state, then narrate a bit of the action in the scene. Sometimes, this leads naturally to a cross-cut or flashback, which you do and then flip the next cards to see where you stand. It worked for us.<br/><br/><b>Poison'd</b> also has a nice place in the system for cross-cuts like this, since you want to roll to acquire Xs and how you do that can be in the here and now or in the past, makes no difference. There's the added tension that a failed roll can bring the fight in the present, so the action in flashbacks can sometimes cascade out to the now as things fall apart and trouble erupts.<br/><br/>Also, duh... <i>Sorcerer</i>.

The more I think about it, the less I think that the specific kind of cutting we're doing is possible in a game like, say, PTA.<br/><br/>The main thing about the 'permission to cut' in Grey Ranks is that it's not attached to anything other than your scene currency. Essentially you have two 'coins', one to activate your mission scene and one for your personal scene. You can spend these coins <b>at any time during someone else's scene</b> (they can say, "Hey, I want to come back to my scene, OK?" and that should be honored). Since you have such limited scene resources, you want to use these coins for maximum effect. You don't have the option of building a narrative around just your character, so you must, for the sake of coherence and story impact, show how the scene you intend to have relates to and recontextualizes the scenes that came before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127918/#Comment_127918" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T06:00:31+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  6:00AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In terms of technique, you can play the game in straight "turn taking" mode, without using interruption at all, and it works fine.  But off the top of my head, here are some good uses for disrupting scenes:<br/><br/>You can interrupt to edit - if a scene is looking a little directionless, your counterpoint can punch it up, add meaning and definition.  This is awesome.  The example with Clinton and the bribe, above, did this.  <br/><br/>You can deliberately interrupt at the point of maximum tension.  By cutting immediately before any sort of resolution (in mission scenes this will be purely narrative, but you can still do it) you leave everybody in a state of suspense, and the energy level zig-zags wonderfully.  <br/><br/>You can deliberately interrupt at a point of thematic potential, which is really, really interesting and fun.  I recall a game in which someone had established that it was pissing down rain, and our crew was holed up in some basement in Wola under fire.  Emily Care Boss took her cue from the rain and called for a personal scene where she pulled in the situation element "a bound stack of love letters, soaking in the gutter" and a flashback to a miserable day during the occupation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128007/#Comment_128007" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T10:18:03+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 10:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 10:33AM by Nathan_H.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Durham Crew,<br/>\n     Did you guys feel like you were playing children, or inexperienced and ill-equiped soldiers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128009/#Comment_128009" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T10:22:09+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 10:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was definitely playing a young man (I chose 17 as my age) with more bravado than sense.

That's totally OK, as long as you check in with the original scene person and don't lose the original intent through plot development, which I imagine could happen.

The session suffered a little because of the lapse - it took us a while to get up to speed and we surely forgot some of the details we'd created earlier.  But the clear through-lines emerged and advanced, all pretty sharply focused on things we hold dear.  <br/><br/>My guy, Robert, is in love with Remi's guy, Zygmunt.  By the end of chapter six we were lovers, Robert's mind was more or less broken, his twitchy nervousness subsumed by an eerie stillness and a slavish devotion to the drunk, horrible, amoral Zygmunt.<br/><br/>Clinton's guy, Bogus\u0142aw, lost his eldest sister to a horrible mistake, fell in love with a well-connected Russian, got beat nearly to death and executed my cousin.<br/><br/>Danusia, Joe's girl, is hard aground with her Catholicism and in love with the devoted Communist Bogus\u0142aw.  It was a night of clearing out traitors and informants - Danusia also shot a Catholic priest at the Polytechnic.  She's definitely at the breaking point.  <br/><br/>So it was grim and often moving.  We're set up for a vastly tragic third session with plenty of remaining resources to guide the story as we choose, if we elect to give up our precious stuff.  Everyone but Clinton has invoked out thing held dear, so there are a lot of free dice available.  We've all agreed that he's getting no love from us until he frees up his little sister for us to pick off!  We've definitely played the grid very tactically and cooperatively thusfar.  Robert, my guy, is in the most danger at this point.  <br/><br/>There's something a little unexpected about <i>Grey Ranks' </i>collective missions, in that players have free reign in their description, guided only by the die size they contribute.  This can lead to talky, descriptive scenes where the spotlight player merely says what happens.  Occasionally this is perfect, but groups should take care to ensure that mission scenes involve multiple characters and include some interaction.  We fell into this trap in chapter four and corrected later on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136239/#Comment_136239" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T05:01:58+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  5:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2008 5:03AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We finished out <i>Grey Ranks</i> game last night.  After a soft mid-section, the game ended on a high note.  Well, a low note, but with a lot of excitement, really good quality play, and both enjoyment and pathos.  We returned to form, editing furiously, and driving toward individual and collective conclusions for our Crew.  It was really cool.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s an interesting thing:  we had conflicts and subsequent outcomes that colored everything that went before.  There was a personal scene, a flashback, where Danusia (age 11) learned that Robert (age 13) was gay.  The crux of the scene was how the very young, very Catholic Danusia would handle this information.  Robert lost; she handled it badly, and we didn\u2019t even play out that reaction \u2013 suddenly the two character\u2019s entire relationship across the previous two play sessions took on a different meaning.  It informed scenes in retrospect.<br/><br/>Of course the third session of<i> Grey Ranks </i>is rough \u2013 you are up against the wall both narratively and mechanically, pretty much destined to fail brutally unless you pull out all your resources, which you have (hopefully) squirreled away.  We blew through everything \u2013 the thing we each held dear was destroyed, every scrap of innocence was lost, all four characters were shattered.  Robert visited the nervous breakdown corner a second time and shot himself in Chapter Nine, after repudiating his collaborationist father and saying goodbye to his lover, who he had once held dear above all things but then abandoned in blind panic.  Zygmunt survived him by a day.  Bogus\u0142aw watched his little sister get machine-gunned by Russian soldiers as she paddled across the Vistula to safety, and later joined the truly terrible RONA  anti-Soviet partisans in the pay of the Germans.  Little Danusia, so devout, had a crazy, gripping scene in which she talked to the Virgin Mary in chapter seven, asking if she\u2019d die a virgin.  Mary told her \u201cyes\u201d.  Danusia\u2019s denoument \u2013 1965, in a convent school in New York state \u2013 a little kid asking about the nun\u2019s funny accent.<br/><br/>We had some seriously good scenes.  There were a couple of times I felt like I\u2019d been punched in the stomach by choices my friends made.<br/><br/>So if you play Grey Ranks, some suggestions, and I hope Joe, Clinton, and Remi will contribute:<br/><br/>My biggest suggestion is to aggressively edit.  If you have a huge issue for your character to resolve, open the chapter with it, and edit near the decision point, and return to it to close the chapter.  This is so powerful.  What transpires in the chapter will inform the outcome in deep and memorable ways.  We were editing like madmen, stopping scenes, jump cutting between scenes, moving around in time and space.  It adds tension and interest and freights small scenes with additional meaning and resonance.  I know I suggest this in the game, but it should be in big red letters.  <br/><br/>Another suggestion \u2013 keep your eyes open for ways to support your fellow players through reincorporation.  There\u2019s no need to introduce a new character if an existing one will do.  Conversely, don\u2019t get hung up on using all the situation elements \u2013 these are scene painting, and are useful even if they don\u2019t end up in the fiction for that chapter.  The scene economy is so insanely tight that you need to be thinking of exactly what you want, and you have the authority to make whatever that is central.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136261/#Comment_136261" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T07:53:04+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  7:53AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, <br/><br/>Can you expand on the "edit" concept a bit?

Remi jumps in, waving his hands and yelling "Edit!" - my mission scene gets cut, he declares a personal scene, and re-introduces a guy we met earlier - a fat pro-German butcher.  Remi's guy Zygmunt busts in on this guy in an outbuilding, dressed in a Wehrmacht auxiliary uniform, gorging himself on sausage.  We haven't had any meat in weeks.  Is Zygmunt going to shoot this guy in the face?  Clinton's turn to yell "edit!" - now we're deeper in, there's another personal scene where he meets some Russian students holed up in the University, there's a beautiful girl whose father is in the Politburo, Clinton's dude is a dedicated Communist, good times.  Then back to Remi, and a scene informed by the privation and hunger of the students.  Then back to me, and a scene informed by the odyssey my guy's Crew has been on, leaving him alone on the battlefield as he pulls a Home Army Lieutenant to safety under fire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136267/#Comment_136267" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T08:30:03+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  8:30AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so edit here is just a shorthand for interrupting scenes with scenes.
