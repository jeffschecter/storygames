I'm very much looking forward to seeing how Lykke works.<br/><br/>I've been thinking a lot recently about using game design to engender or evoke emotions, primarily because I've set myself a weekly goal of game-poem writing to help break out of some creative blocks. But, yes to both of your questions; I don't think that I've traditionally thought of RPGs in these terms - I've always approached things from a mechanics-first viewpoint, I think, and filled things in outwards from there - but lately, very much so. I don't know how much of the specific human condition generating stuff will filter back into the main project that I'm working on from these shorter bursts of emotion- or theme-oriented work, but I'm willing to just let it go, and see what happens. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_259317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259317/#Comment_259317" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T11:48:11+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 11:48AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2010 11:54AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'd love to see how you approach it.</blockquote>Through the game-methods I write (the "method" meaning the whole bandwidth of storyteller-and system-techniques in a game). <br/><br/>My first game with this feature as a major part was <i>Muu</i> (1989), a traditional rpg with GM and players, but with some very original language- and dialogue-rules which helped the players establish a harmonious muuish\xb4ness. Central in this game is the GM\xb4s use of soft voice and poetic-naiive terms in her descriptions, and the continuous focus on and communication of the emotions of the characters. These elements works together with the rest of the game, inducing the players with the harmony of muu, and thus creating harmony in the players too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>games should, on some level, always be about creating joy in any of its possible facets.</blockquote>I see what you mean, but no. No-no-no! "Joy" is the dogma of "entertainment" in disguise. It is putting a clowns costume on an art-form which is equally suited to deal with both comedy and tragedy, and any dramatic genre between them. I believe the reason so many gamesmiths find it difficult to break out of the limited scope of the traditional rpg, is "the tyranny of entertainment" (they are scared brainless by the prospect of not entertaining the average gamer).<br/><br/>Joy is ok, but not as the sole measure for success in a game. It is a very limited design-tool.<br/><br/>Working with other human conditions than joy, it is obvious that you need to have other measures of success. And to work efficiently with such conditions, you need to <i>engage</i> more than you <i>entertain</i>. Focus on how you engage your players, and give them the tools to explore the human condition of your game.<br/><br/>Games should always engage the players, and may enslave or empower them. Roleplaying games should transform the players into sacred vehicles for their characters.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>if you engineer your procedures specifically to evoke an emotional state, how does that color the result?</blockquote>In a lot of ways. Look to Muu; the game creates a very strong fictional universe, and force the players to accept the ramificastions of this universe through the use of a strong method. As the players dive into the fictional universe, it will start to color them, and thus they find themselves looking upon their fictional surroundings with the eyes of a muu. The strangeness of being a muu in this way, evokes certain feelings in the players, and they share in these feelings; curiosity, frustration, joy, contentment, anxiety, relief, extasy ... all of these emotions may be experienced by a single muu during a game-session, and will be part of the player-experience of the game, and the player will communicate them all to the other players (a part of the game-method). Thus the game creates a strong emotional co-existence between the muu-characters of the players.<br/><br/>The strong emotional co-existence of the muu\xb4s in the game, leaves the players with a strong sense of harmony when the game is over. It has the same effect as a successful meditation.<br/><br/>Hope this answers some of your questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259324/#Comment_259324" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T12:18:15+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 12:18PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps poor word choice on my part, Tomas! I recognize that game's can do more than entertain, but I believe they must provide some reward for playing them. Usually this is pleasure - happiness, satisfaction at achievement, self-discovery, learning, catharsis, excitement, camaraderie, something, usually many somethings, usually not a product of intentional design.<br/><br/>Being intentional about emotional states your game induces is interesting to me.

I chose to answer to the chosen word still, as I believe it is most often read as a simile with "entertainment". That one out of the way: all great games gives the players some reward for playing. My favorites are sense of wonder and self-discovery.<br/><br/>All games are, by nature, <i>manipulative</i>; they depend on the players acting out fictional conflicts, engaging in them and using all possible means to win them, as if they where real. A lot of players will actually cheat to win such a fictional conflict.<br/><br/>And a lot of games actually aims at creating certain emotional states in the players; "manipulating" them into feeling fear (CoC) or battle-frenzy (D&amp;D) or paranoia (Paranoia) or what-not.<br/><br/>To induce players with positive feelings is a bit original, I see, but I would believe it to be quite as harmless as inducing them with fear or anger. ;-)<br/><br/>But then; 999 of 1000 people (or even more) do know the difference between fiction and reality, so they will stop short of cheating and will, however engaging the game is, continue to consider the conflict a fictional one. I have worked with games such as these since 1989, and have touched upon a lot of different emotions, without ever having to call for medical help or the police. ;-)<br/><br/>I would say that a historically based game/scenario from, lets say; Poland in WWII, would be in greater danger of hitting on a sore spot of a player, and thus creating some undesired effect (crying, nervous breakdown, psychotic episode, etc.). ;-)<br/><br/>No, I really do not find it very constructive to discuss possible dangers linked to the playing of dialogue based rpg\xb4s such as ours. There is no evidence that such a game has ever damaged anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259510/#Comment_259510" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T01:49:41+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  1:49AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll get a bit personal here and say that it will take quite a lot for me to play a game which intends to create specific emotions in me.

I had to think about it a bit before playing it; it's a heavy theme, and I didn't know how it would work out. I could feel the game for days afterwards. It's a good game, but heavy, and not something I'd want to play very often.<br/><br/>So that's what I mean by "it takes a lot". If someone invites me to play something with a cool new mechanic, or focused on a certain <i>mood</i> - such as many of the role-playing poems; boredom, contemplation, existential exploration, silliness - I'll usually want to play.

People respond to my ideas by talking of "dangers" and "manipulation".<br/><br/>I\xb4ve pondered why, as I\xb4ve never considered myself manipulative, and have never seen any dangerous states being created in my games. Not a whiff of it, actually.<br/><br/>This morning I finally solved the 4-piece puzzle of this conundrum; <br/><br/><b>- 1 -</b><br/>I am talking about my design as a gamesmith. I am into highly conscious design, with "how a game affect the players" as a strong principle. I\xb4ve made a lot of game-experiments to hone my skills in this field, and have so far succeeded reasonably. So I am able to design games that really makes the players transport themselves into strong feelings and/or moods.<br/><br/><b>- 2 -</b><br/>Emotions are emotional stuff, of course, so people read my posts on such subjects with a great deal of skepticism. And as long as I fail to underline that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is the players that creates the emotions</span>, it is easy to read me as "manipulative".<br/><br/><b>- 3 -</b><br/>At the same time I take it for granted that you all understand that my games, as well as other games, are tools by which the <i>players</i> make themselves happy, or sad, or entertained. The players transport themselves to the green fields of emotions, and explore them, using my game. I do not lead them there, and I do not steer them while they are there.<br/><br/><b>- 4 -</b><br/>The <i>players</i> agree to play a game, for example my game <i>Lykke</i>, and when they agree to do so they also agree to reach for the goal of the game; some form of happiness. There is nothing "manipulative" in it, only an <i>agreement</i> to share in the creation of a certain experience.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I don't feel comfortable having someone consciously try to make me sad or happy over the course of several hours - in game form</blockquote><b>You</b> are making <b>yourself</b> happy in such a game, Matthijs. So I believe you may lay back and relax in your resistance towards others making you something. :-)<br/><br/>I hope this clarifies some issues around such a design-practise. It is not some hazardous mumbo-jumbo, but a way to make games that people may use to create great experiences.<br/><br/>So, I hope we can discuss this topic in a more constructive way now:<br/><br/><b>- Do you work with player-moods/emotions as a design-goal, and how do you do it?</b><br/><br/><b>- What kind of moods/emotions would you like to investigate in a game, and why?</b><br/><br/><b>- Can you imagine, or have you seen, game-tools which are efficient in games aiming at moods/emotions?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
