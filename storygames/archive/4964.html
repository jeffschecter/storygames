But I couldn't help but notice that, while the game has a character creation system, rules for interaction between players and the GM and a setting, it does not seem to have any kind of resolution system. The author suggests that one could be grafted on, if the reader was so inclined.<br/><br/>Some of the rules are challenging. For example, players can only speak with the voice of their characters - if the player says it, the character said it. So the only way to act in the game world is to narrate your actions in character. The GM must narrate as if he were the narrator in a story book i.e. in the past tense.<br/><br/>So, I was wondering, has anyone played this game? How did it go? Were you able to stick to the interaction rules? Did the lack of a resolution system matter?<br/><br/>Has anyone tried to use any kind of resolution system with Puppetland? Did it affect your ability to speak only in character?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111498/#Comment_111498" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T03:45:37+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  3:45AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run and played it, some years back.

We just playtested my latest game last night (<i>A Flower for Mara</i>) which is in the Jeepform tradition ('cause, like, all the cool kids are doing it), and I'm thinking that I'm probably in the right zone to play <i>Puppetland</i>.<br/><br/>When I ran it (which is probably six years ago, at this point), I remember feeling very naked as Narrator.  No dice to hide behind; just my decisions.  Now, I think that I'd flourish in that environment.  I also think that adding dice or whatnot would break it.<br/><br/><i>Puppetland</i> was also responsible for one of my favorite gaming moments.  My sister Adiel was playing a puppet who had the description "I cannot be sad".  At one point in the game, something awful happened.  She said, "That's terrible", and then she scribbled off a puzzle piece from her character sheet.  The loss wasn't a punishment to the player; it became a way to express what was happening to the character.  Great stuff.<br/><br/>Also, if you can find the Hogshead edition, it's worth getting for the art.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111622/#Comment_111622" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T11:07:39+00:00" title="December  4, 2007 11:07AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played six sessions of <i>Puppetland</i>... ohmygod ten years ago.

Technically, the diceless resolution system in <i>Puppetland</i> is much like the one in <i>Amber</i>: straight comparison between stats, with the GM as the final arbiter of the outcome. In practice the "is" lists even correspond to the four attributes of strength, speed, size and weight... It's something of a filler game for our group, since each session is only meant to last an hour and doesn't require elaborate preparation in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111816/#Comment_111816" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T00:51:06+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 12:51AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of nowhere, I'd like to say that my wife and a couple friends played this game with me a few years back. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife found the speaking-in-first-person-present-tense bit somewhat frustrating, but says she enjoyed the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked the comparisons idea a great deal at the time and I could never tell why. I think it's because it hit on the idea starting to emerge from story games - that the resolution of the task in the imaginary world of the game might come out more satisfying if it were secondary to the resolution of the character or the story or whatever the game is supposed to be about. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt did take about half an hour to get everyone used to speaking as if they were in a kiddie show or children's book, but it was fun, in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe... um... played a space story, as I recall, intentionally trying the idea out somewhere beyond the setting suggested by the game. The characters were still puppets, and limited by the hour is golden rule, etc. But we tried defining the hour as the length of the voyage of a puppet space ship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI beleive the main plot of the episode devolved into a crisis with the space "Terlet" as I recall and the poor marianette had to do a space-walk to save her little sister's rather bellicose finger-puppet.

Again as in <i>Amber</i>, resolving any conflict relies heavily on the good judgment of the GM, although the booklet does suggest just going along with the actions of the PCs and letting the "good guys" <i>almost</i> always win in the end, unless the players try something completely ridiculous (such as blowing up a house by suddenly declaring that it's built on a giant firecracker).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo quote a relevant bit from "Puppetmastering":<br/>\n<i>"In the course of each tale, the actors will be doing their best to react to the situations you throw at them and find a way of turning each situation to their advantage. You'll have to adjudicate what happens when puppets come into conflict, whether that conflict is physical, verbal, or emotional.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't sweat the details. If the Sally Red Buttons player says she picks up a rock and throws it at the nutcracker, don't worry too much about whether a rock would really be there, close at hand. Of course, if an actor tries to do something ridiculous -- 'It's a good thing this house is built on top of an enormous firecracker! I'll light it!' -- then you should disallow it: 'Sally looked to and fro, but there was no sign of the firecracker. That must have been some other house.'"</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steven" title="Steven"><img alt="Steven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://sjhhanlon.wordpress.com/files/2007/10/tinyphoto.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steven">Steven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111860/#Comment_111860" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T06:15:41+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  6:15AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GrimGent</cite><br><em>"In the course of each tale, the actors will be doing their best to react to the situations you throw at them and find a way of turning each situation to their advantage.

That isn't how I had interpreted things from the version I read (I wasn't reading that carefully, I must confess). Though I think that I prefer a what-you-say-is-what-happens model. Apart from anything else, it isn't entirely clear to me that the house being built on a giant firecracker <i>is</i> ridiculous in the context!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111888/#Comment_111888" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T07:53:43+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  7:53AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True, Punch's dastardly plans might include planting firecrackers into the homes of Puppettown so that anyone who opposes him would have to live in the shadow of being blown away at the least sign of defiance. However, that's not really up to the actors to decide during play. <i>Puppetland</i> may be a storytelling game, but it's one that makes a sharper distinction between the GM and the other players than just about any "conventional" RPG. Even the online text from the old site isn't exactly misleading about the authority of that one person. For instance, from the beginning:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>"The puppetmaster is responsible for creating and presenting the stories of the game, and he or she serves both as referee for the game's rules and as an actor who portrays a number of supporting roles."</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd from the end:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>"Maker's Land may be a beautiful place, but all children grow up and perhaps it is the destiny of Maker's Land to grow up, too. Judy claims that the Maker's tear will restore everything to the way it was -- will it? That's up to the puppetmaster."</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hogshead version just makes all that a little more explicit, with examples of narration and cut scenes that a GM might use to guide the flow of her tale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111963/#Comment_111963" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T10:10:35+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 10:10AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly enough, the rules for Puppetland were transposed almost effortlessly into a Battletech game I ran for well over a year and a half, in marathon sessions. John's done an amazing job of simplifying mechanics for a group with a heavy-handed GM. When we started playing, we were using d20 for portability and familiarity's sake, with the intent of homebrewing some mechanics. The longer we played, the less the dice mattered, until weeks went by without anyone realizing we still had d20 sheets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111975/#Comment_111975" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T10:32:15+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 10:32AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played it as "what you say happens" which of course includes what the GM says as Narrator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
