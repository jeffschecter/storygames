                    HI, I finally got around to coming over to Story-Games, but most of you have seen me elsewhere. I've decided to celebrate my newcomer status with an annoying question about dice. It's connected to a game I'm designing (possibly to several games,) but the details aren't relevant.<br/><br/>I have a dice mechanic that uses d10 pools and looks at individual dice values. Never mind what we do with the values, or how to determine success; it doesn't matter for this question, but I will mention that matches are important. If you roll 2 3 5 3 2 2, you have one +2 match and one +3 match.<br/><br/>I don't want the dice pools to get ungainly, so I want to give people an option to eliminate extra dice if you're rolling ten or more dice. <br/><br/>I have two options:
<ol>
<li> Drop X dice to get a +1 on any one match. There's a risk: if you don't roll a match, you lose that +1.</li>
<li>Drop Y dice to choose one guaranteed die result, such as a 0. It's exactly like you rolled a die and got the 0 randomly, If you roll another 0, you get a +2 match.</li>
</ol>
Now, my initial idea was that X should be two dice and Y should be five dice, but those are just numbers I pulled out of my hat. What I would like is to find out two things:
<ol>
<li>What is X, where if I roll 10-X dice, the chance of getting any +2 match (rolling two 0s, for example) are close to the same as the chance of getting any +3 match on 10 dice?</li>
<li>What is Y, where if I roll 10-Y dice, the chance of getting a 0 is close to the same as the chance of getting two 0s on 10 dice?</li>
</ol>
I know the chance of getting a 0 on one die is 10% and thought I had the correct chance of rolling a 0 on any number of dice using a spreadsheet, but I must have messed up the calculations for the other conditions, because I kept getting weird numbers: probabilities going down when they should have gone up, and so on.<br/><br/>I figured I'd ask here in case anyone already calculated the chance of a match or a specific number on multiple dice before I went to the trouble of writing a script to roll thousands of dice and determine the probabilities by experiment.                </div>

                            You're wildly miscalculating the value of Y.  Y is basically worthless unless you spend multiple times, and even then you're almost certainly better off rolling a big pile of dice.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest, in all honestly, just letting people roll die pools larger than 10.  It really doesn't hurt anything to have a guaranteed +.  ORE engine went down this path and failed at it.<br/>

                            well, no, Y isn't worthless. I'm doing two different things with the dice, sometimes simultaneously. Thing One is essentially ORE, but applied to Discovery instead of Conflict. Only matches matter. But Thing Two is different; matches are important, but even dice with no matches are worth a +1, and the dice are interpreted in numeric order, so 0s are important. (Other numbers can be important for the Discovery part, if you want to Discover a specific thing.)<br/>
<br/>
People can always roll however many dice they actually have. This isn't a requirement, it's a way to cut down the headache of interpretting huge numbers of dice. If no one else uses the dice-dropping option, fine, but I want it for *me*, at least.                        </div>

I totally don't understand this in the context of the rest of the rules.  It seems like the handling time for this ruleset is really amazingly long.  Why worry about how many d10s you're rolling, when the trade off is decisions about dropping dice ahead of time.                        </div>

                            Ben: sorry about that... but when I said the other details didn't matter, I guess I should have made it clear that it shouldn't be interpreted in terms of a specific unmentioned system. The unstated part of my system is why I want the specific answers I asked, but I don't think it's relevant. If you feel it's necessary, though, I'll post the resolution system.<br/>
<br/>
Judson: the reason why I'm asking for the closest probabilities is that I want to minimize the decision-making process. Perhaps this means forgetting about the first option entirely and just saying "if you have a pool of ten or more dice, you can drop one die to get a specific die result" and leave it at that. Then, the decision for the player is as close to "do I want to roll 20 dice, or just roll 9 dice and assume I rolled three 0s, five 1s, and three 9s on my imaginary 11 dice?" as I can possibly get.<br/>
<br/>
But I figure other players might object. What do you think?                        </div>

<br/>
If you want a full analysis of your system, then yes, I would really like to know the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
What you're doing is definitely higher handling time than just a big die pool, though.  If you want to reduce handling time, here's how I'd do it:<br/>
<br/>
If you have 10 dice, you roll 10 dice.<br/>
If you have 11 dice, you set one die to 1, roll the rest.<br/>
If you have 12 dice, you set one die to 1, one die to 2, and roll the rest.<br/>
Etc.<br/>
<br/>
This is super-easy (there's no decision making) and, while it isn't quite as good (mathematically) as rolling all of your dice, it's not bad.  Each new die definitely helps.<br/>

Hey dude, yeah, sorry about picking your thread out, but I was out of town when the other one started (and it had progressed pretty far by the time I had come back).<br/><br/>For the most part, the Game Design forum at RPGNet doesn't scroll too fast, although I don't make use of that forum much myself: But I definitely go there for number-crunching question: I keep that forum in my toolbox, because it's a great tool for those sorts of things.<br/><br/>But carry on here for now.

                            Ben: I may actually have to do that. I'll keep it as an option, and probably do one playtest with that rule and one with a different rule. Thanks for the suggestion!<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to summarize the Discovery/Conflict mechanic to keep it as short as possible. The game I'm developing this for right now is the v1.1 Kanthe game, but I plan on using this as a core mechanic in a couple other games, including the rewrite of IceRunner, so I'm going to leave out some Kanthe-specific stuff, like the mapping rules and reward rules as well as the details on interpreting Discovery results, because they don't impact Conflicts. I will mention, however, that Kanthe is a solitaire game, so one person is rolling two sets of dice for both Challenge (your character) and Opposition (the monster, a trap, a locked door, etc.) So, if you advance to 9th level and have three allies with a Strength of 5 each, plus a +3 sword, you're rolling 27 Challenge Dice vs.20-30 Opposition Dice in a Conflict. Simultaneously. I think you can see what I'm getting at.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the rules: characters have a Strength rating (which really means Power, not physical strength) and several weapons, tools, and advantages, each with their own Strength. Each tool or advantage applies to a specific type of conflict: physical, mental, social, stealth... the list is potentially endless. Defensive items and advantages provide Defensive Strength, blocking Actions; other items provide extra dice to roll in Conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
There are two reasons to roll dice: Conflict (who wins?) and Discovery (what's in the room? what's he waving around menacingly?) Roll both Challenge and Opposition for both rolls, because: (a) Discovery can turn into Conflict; and, (b) you interpret Challenge Dice dice one way in Discovery, Opposition Dice another way.<br/>
<br/>
For Discovery, you look for matches on the Challenge Dice. You look the value rolled up on some table to identify which monster, trap, or effect you're dealing with; the number of dice rolled with that value is the Strength of that monster/trap/effect. Two sets of matches means two critters, and so on. The Opposition Dice are used to modify the description of the critter. Either there's one descriptor per set of matches, or one descriptor per value; either way, you look up the values on a descriptor table. (Most of these tables you build yourself during setup, but I will have default tables.)<br/>
<br/>
For Conflict, every value rolled, whether there's a match or not, is an Action. If there is no match, it's a +1 action; otherwised, the Strength of the action is equal to the number of matches. Actions happen in numerical order, so every turn (roll of the dice) is split into ten segments, numbered 0 to 9.<br/>
<br/>
Actions can be combined, but can't be split. If I need a +3 action but roll a 0, 1 and 2, I can combine them for a series of actions that begin on segment 0 and end on segment 2. This matters because: what if my opponent kills me on segment 1?<br/>
<br/>
What you're trying to beat on any given segment is the Defensive Strength of the target for that type of action. I do a +3 hit with my sword and the creature has +4 armor? No effect. +2 armor? He takes one +3 physical wound. I lie to him about how his boss put me in charge, using a +2 action? He takes a +2 social wound. And so on. If the target gets more individual wounds than the target's Strength, that means death, or conversion into an ally, or whatever the typical stakes of that type of conflict are. Only the number of wounds counts for this, not the Strengths; you use a wound's Strength when trying to heal it.<br/>
<br/>
Situational Advantages add dice to the side they favor. Weapons, tools, and advantages are one kind of situational advantage, but you can also create favorable conditions to add dice to the conflict. You use actions for this, too. Wounds are situational advantages; if you are mentally wounded (confused, distracted) and I make a mental attack (trickery,) I get one extra die for every mental wound you have.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it's probably not relevant, but you can attack a defensive item or a situation instead of directly attack an opponent. Armor doesn't use its Defensive Strength when directly attacked, but might be defended by something else.<br/>
<br/>
That should be it, but if I think of anything, I'll add it.                        </div>

                            Okay, so my first question is "If Kanthe is a solitare game, and you're competant enough to write a die-rolling script, why not code up the game and forget about the dice?"  This is definitely not intended as judgemental.  I think there must be a really interesting reason why and I'm curious.<br/>

The chance of rolling at least one "0" on Xd10 is <br/>
<br/>
1 - ( 9/10 )^X^<br/>
<br/>
In other words: the inverse of rolling 1-9 on all the dice.<br/>
<br/>
The chance of a matching roll is more tricky.  It should be roughly equivalent to "at least N "0" on Xd10" and from experience the formulation is more difficult.  It's easy to double-count dice, IIRC.                        </div>

Thanks for the formula, that verifies that I was at least doing <em>one</em> thing right in the spreadsheet... it's figuring out the multiples where I must have gone wrong.</p>

<p>Okay, so my first question is "If Kanthe is a solitare game, and you're competant<br/>

</div></blockquote>
<p>Here are some reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>it's not a computer game. that's a trivial reason, but I'd like to have something people can play when not in front of a computer. I may build a die roller into a TiddlyWiki for fun, but that leads to...</li>
<li>Map Dice. These are d6s used to generate the dungeon. They don't affect Conflicts, so I didn't describe them. The Map Dice system is fast and elegant, but would be ridiculously complex to script, because it relies on visual elements.</li>
<li>portability. I'm going to use this as a core resolution system in some other non-solitaire RPGs. Writing a die-rolling script isn't a good solution.</li>

                            Oh, I wanted to talk about the probabilities more. When I tried last night to calculate the probabilities, I assumed that the probability of rolling a match on N dice is the same as the probability of rolling a specific number on N-1 dice, reasoning that you roll 1 die, then you determine the probability of matching that number on the remaining dice. I discovered that was wrong. I guess one thing I forgot to take into account is that, even if I fail to match the number rolled on the first die, I can still match the number rolled on the second die with my remaining dice, and so on... so I guess it's the sum of the probability of rolling a specific number on 1 die through N-1 dice?<br/>
<br/>
The other one should just be the sum of the probability of getting a specific number on N dice and N-1 dice, I think.                        </div>

<p>Oh, dammit, those numbers go over one. I guess you do have to subtract something, to account for double-counted dice.</p>
<p>Something like the probability of rolling X on N Dice, plus the probability of rolling X on N-1 Dice, minus the probability of not rolling X on N-1 Dice, and so on?</p>

                            One thing I constantly forget about probablity is that while intersection is analogous to multiplication, the following intuition that union is analogous to addition is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
In other words: The chance of a flipped coin coming up heads: 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
The chance of 2 coins both coming up heads (intersection): 1/4  -&gt; 1/2 x 1/2<br/>
<br/>
The chance of N coins all coming up heads (intersection): 1/2^N^<br/>
<br/>
**but**<br/>
<br/>
The chance of at least one coin coming up heads (union) is **not** 1/2 + 1/2.  It's easier to restate it as "not (both coins come up tails)", which is 1 - ( 1/2^2 ) = 3/4.<br/>
<br/>
The trick to remember is: if you're adding a numerator, it's probably wrong.<br/>
<br/>
As far as "the chance of a +X match of M dice" seems equivalent to "roll a 0 on X on M dice," which does have some weird crap to account for the fact that the dice can move around, as it were.<br/>
<br/>
The irritating thing is that I just did all this math, but I don't have my notes handy.  It's something like<br/>
<br/>
( X dice coming up 0 ) x ( M-X dice not coming up zero ) x ( number of ways dice could sort )<br/>
<br/>
It's that last factor that's killing me.  It might be M! / ( X! )( M-X! ) or something.<br/>
