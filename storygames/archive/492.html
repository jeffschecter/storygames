                    I did some playtesting / demoing at <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=215" rel="nofollow">IKEAcon</a> in March. Long story made short: new story map idea rules and old resolution mechanics are at best lackluster, at worst broken.<br/><br/>I've done some retooling and wanted to share my thoughts and get some feedback. I'm especially hoping Tony, Shawn, and any others who might have played Verge before will jump in and let me know if they think this will work or not. Yeah, playtesting will prove it out, but I'm hoping for advice and ideas here.<br/><br/><b>Verge Is Cyberpunk on the Edge</b><br/><br/>Not just cyberpunk, but also post-cyberpunk, transhumanism, or detective noir science fiction. Really, you can play a bunch of genres with Verge, but let's call it a cyberpunk game. It's a game about technology and ideas and relationships and risk.<br/><br/>Players generate the setting and situation as part of play using a story map. Characters are strongly tied to that map. The players each get a character but they need buy-in from other players about the stuff that ends up on their sheet. Each player has to make personal choices about what is most important to them.<br/><br/>Characters use their personal strengths, their friends, and technology to accomplish their goals while the world presses down on their personal issues. <br/><br/>Expects bits and pieces as I write them up today, all in this thread.                </div>

<b>The Story Map</b><br/><br/>In the first phase of play, the players create a story map. This is a conceptual map, not a geographical map. One player writes a word or short phrase (an <i>element</i>) in the center of a blank sheet of paper, then passes the paper to the player on his left. Each player contributes to the map, then passes it to the next player, till the map is "done."<br/><br/>A player can add to the map in a number of ways. First of all, he can add a new <i>element</i> by writing it on the map. Second, he can connect any two elements with a line and explain what <i>relationship</i> that line represents (and note the line if it helps everyone remember). Third, he can <i>ratify</i> any element or relationship by putting an exclamation point after it. Fourth, he can <i>question</i> any element or relationship by putting a question mark after it. Each question cancels a ratification and vice versa. For example, "Intelligent penguins!!?!" means that three players have ratified the element and one player has questioned it. It has a net ratification of "!!" since the question cancels one ratification. Once you have ratified or question something, you can't ratify or question it again.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example</span><br/>Adam writes "virtual reality" in the center of the map. Belinda writes "chi" on the left side. Carl writes "Megasoft, Inc." on the other side. Denise draws a line between "virtual reality" and "chi" and explains that one's strength in VR is closely tied to that person's spiritual energy. Adam writes "zombie brain vats". Belinda thinks that's really cool, so she ratifies it ("zombie brain vats!"). Carl doesn't like it, so he questions it ("zombie brain vats!?"). Denise chimes in with her own ratification ("zombie brain vats!?!"). Adam could also ratify it but he leaves it alone and draws a line from "zombie brain vats!?!" to "virtual reality" and explains that the zombie brains are the source of computational power and memory storage for VR. Belinda adds an element, "rogue memories," and all the other players nod and make appreciative noises...<br/><br/>I'm not telling the whole story yet, because each player will be creating his character at the same time he contributes to the story map, but let's take one rule concept at a time.                        </div>

<b>Character Creation</b><br/><br/>Each player creates his character while generating the story map. At the beginning of each player's turn to contribute — before he contributes — the player can <i>claim</i> an element (but not a relationship) by writing his initials under it in small letters. He can claim an element even if someone else has claimed it; they just have to share.<br/><br/>At the time he claims it, he should write the element's <i>power</i> next to his initials under that element ("A - 2" under "Virtual Reality", for example). Power is calculated as the current sum of the ratification level for the element and all its relationships. This are points that Adam will not get. Only points added after this point will go to Adam's character.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://verge.legendary.org/images/c/cb/Verge_brainvats.gif" width="600"/><br/><br/>Adam should figure out where to put this on his sheet. He has different kinds of traits: Strengths, Weaknesses, Allies, Enemies, and Technology. "Virtual reality" definitely fits in to Technology but Adam should personalize his trait for his character. Adam decides to write on his character sheet a Strength called VR Expert.<br/><br/>As the story map changes, Adam will figure out the power of all the elements on which he has based his traits, subtract the starting power written by his initials, and write those numbers next to the appropriate traits. For example, if the power of "virtual reality" on the story map had increased to 5, Adam would write a 3 next to his VR Expert trait.<br/><br/>The story map is "done" when all players have fleshed out their traits sufficiently. To do this, each player must have at least two each of Strengths, Weaknesses, Allies, Enemies, and Technology and a total of 30 points among all traits. A player can have more than two traits of each type, but he cannot have more than 30 points among all of them. When a player reaches 30 points, he must stop changing his character.<br/><br/>The character sheet has 30 boxes across the bottom. Use these to track your free points during character generation.                        </div>

                            Once everyone has used all 30 points for character traits, the story map is done. Note that every trait has to be based on something on the story map (thanks, Tony L-B, for that idea!). This is easier for Allies, Enemy, and Technology and harder for Strengths and Weaknesses. You're smart, though, and you'll figure it out. <br/><br/><b>Drives and Issues</b><br/><br/>Every character has <i>drives</i>, which are things that they need or goals that they want to accomplish, and <i>issues</i>, which are problems that get in the way of their drives.<br/><br/>Each player should figure out what his highest and second highest trait scores are. For each point in the second highest trait, create one drive. For each point in the highest trait, create one issue that gets in the way of at least one drive. <br/><br/>As your character gains traits, your highest trait go up. This means you have to create new issues.<br/><br/>In play, you will be unable to ignore your character's drives without threatening his existence.                        </div>

<b>Role-Play</b><br/><br/>After the story map and the characters are complete, play goes in scenes. The player to the left of the last one to add to the story map gets the first scene. <br/><br/>That player picks an element or relationship on the story map for the scene to be <i>about</i>. Characters have a tie to that element or relationship, or any element or relationship touching it, are invited into the scene. Their players may choose to have the characters in the scene at any time and they can just announce their presence and what they're doing. The current player should set the scene — where it is set, when, what is going on, who is there, and so on. He can make up people and stuff and pull in other things from the story map, too, even if they're not connected. The scene is connecting them, even if only superficially. <br/><br/>Players in the scene get a chance to interact with other characters there. If they want to interact with a non-player character, they should designate someone to take on the role (preferably someone not already in the scene, but anyone will do in a pinch). Role-playing happens. <br/><br/>At some point, the current player must choose another player to create a <i>conflict</i> for him. The conflict player creates a situation that threatens one or more of the current character's drives by poking at that character's issues. This means that players must pay attention to one another's characters!<br/><br/>The conflict player describes what nasty thing is happening, how it threatens the current player's character, and then those two players determine the stakes for winning and losing. Traits are brought in on the player's side. Remember the element or relationship that this scene is <i>about</i>? Its power is brought in against the player. Other players have the opportunity to <i>pump up the volume</i> (increase the player's risk — more later). Dice are rolled and rerolled using the dice mechanics. Someone narrates the conclusion of the scene appropriate to the dice result. <br/><br/>Stakes can effect the story map. If the character has enough <i>boosts</i> (experience points, more or less, but I probably need a new name for these), he can spend them when stakes are being set and say he's trying to change an aspect of the story map. Adding a new, unconnected element costs 1 boost. Adding a relationship costs 1 boost per point of power on both sides of the relationship (connecting a power-3 element to a power-1 element costs 4 boosts). Ratifying or questioning an element costs 1 boost per point of power already on that element. This effectively raises or lowers the power of the element and can effect the traits on character sheets. <br/><br/>A player can add a new trait based on an element or relationship. This costs 1 boost per point of power the trait represents.<br/><br/>A player stakes his boosts when he tries to change the map or his character. If he loses the conflict, he loses the boosts and doesn't get to make the change.                        </div>

                            I was thinking no, but maybe I don't understand your question.<br/><br/>The 30 points are used by writing traits based on the map. If you buy into a map element when it's 3 points, that costs you nothing. If that map element goes to 4, then 5, you cross off one of your 30 boxes each time it increases. The net cost to you is 2 boxes.<br/><br/>I think this requires a good deal of strategy in the map mini-game. It just puts a deadline on it -- when you run out of boxes, the mini-game is over for you.                        </div>

                            I was thinking of two specific alternate options located under number 4:<br/>
<br/>
1. Allow any non-active player to claim the title of opponent for the conflict - this lets the player with the most interest in that location or scene or character at the moment directly into the action.<br/>
<br/>
2. The group hashes out who gets to, or who *must*, serve as opposition, with some sort of formal or semi-formal (nominations) mechanic - basically, just like above, but formal controls to get people involved, or limit a particular player's abition to be a de-facto GM! ;)  <br/>
<br/>
Though, really, neither of these would be as easy as having a designated opponent. (If that is what you are saying you have now, right? I was thinking you could just pick anyone...)                        </div>

                            Yeah, the current player just picks someone to run the opposition for that scene. Next scene, it might be someone else. If the player wants to say, "Hey, who has a cool idea for my scene?" and pick the person who offers the best idea, that's fine. Or he can choose randomly. Or he can always pick Bob. Whatever. I don't think it matters a ton.                        </div>

                            I've made some sweet, sweet changes to this. The story map (renamed "network") creates character, setting, and situation. There's a setup phase but the same rules plus dice mechanics continue to develop the network during play. <br/><br/>Read about it on my <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/161991.html" rel="nofollow">LiveJournal</a>.

                            I guess I must have been sleeping, so sorry to respond this late. Better late than  never I suppose <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Man, I think you've made some very exiting changes. I must admit that Verge, to me, now looks very promising indeed. I am having a read through the playtest rules, but I like what I have seen so far.<br/><br/>The collaborative Load Phase is great.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>
