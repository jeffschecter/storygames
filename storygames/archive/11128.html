We were going to sit down to eat chili and homemade bread at 7:00 while starting play.<br/><br/>7:00 rolled around, and I was still cubing the steak. 7:20 I had the ingredients ready to simmer, when I realized I misread the recipe, and that it required 2 hours to cook, not 20 minutes. So instead I put it in the pressure cooker for 20 mins to cook, then boiled it on high for a few mins to boil away the liquid and make it thick.<br/><br/>It was delicious. But it wasn't ready until about 2 hours later anyway because of the cooker, boiling and other random BS. By then, the session was as dead as a doornail. We talked about work, life, gaming and media for an hour before calling it a night and rescheduling to the following week (tonight, actually).<br/><br/>Anyone have tales of gaming failure?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247070/#Comment_247070" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T08:57:32+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  8:57AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I have this friend named Ken who's an all-around awesome guy, but it's like his presence sends out waves that disrupt gaming sessions.

Most of the fail before that was me trying to run indie games I'd never played before, for people who'd never played them before, and who weren't all that interested in trying new things. I had one person walk out of Burning Wheel because he didn't want to roll dice against other players. (?)<br/><br/>Mostly I'm dredging that up so I can satisfy the thread topic and move on to the real topic of this thread - chili (and foods that take time to cook)...<br/><br/>Two words for you...crock pot. More specifically, a crock pot with a good timer and automatic cutoff. I'll get up on a Saturday, prep all my chili ingredients the same time I make breakfast, put everything in the crock pot, and set it to cook 8 hours on low heat. Then I forget about it and go out and do weekend stuff. When I get home, the chili is waiting for me.

Three gamer men, two non-gamer women. Having been advised by husband of the wife to "just let her play the game, even if not optimal," I proceed to piss off the OTHER woman with advice. In my "defense," the wife was frequently either cheating or incapable of learning  the rules "equip and declare your action at the start of the turn" and, thus, would randomly swap out equipment, start to plot out an Advance then actually shift it to a Battle with Fatigue-paid movement, etc.--she'd even, once, tried to change targets after a roll, seeing it to be a good roll wasted on a chump. Now, I won't say "cheating"--even when she "recovers three Health" by taking a 5-Health token and returning a 1-Health token to the pool (hey, subtraction is HARD in gaming!)--but I will say, "Damn, haven't you played this game, like, ten times?!? Learn Rule One, please, finally!"<br/><br/>But I was advised to just roll with it and never mind if she got lost or made low-optimal plays. Yet, somehow, I couldn't remember to apply this to the other (very prickly) woman who'd only played once before. Now, she's not the world's most patient person, and she HAS only played once; but she (too, for some reason) couldn't seem to get her head around the four (woah, 4!) types of actions, nor that a Fatigue potion restores all Fatigue, but a  Health potion only heals 3 Health (tough distinction, that one!).<br/><br/>ANYWAY, in one clutch turn, she wants to Battle but spend a few Fatigue to get into range a bit more--well and god. She has 3 Fatigue. She spends one to drink a Fatigue potion (!) [that's the chess notion for "WTF kind of blunder is THAT shit?!?"] so that she can be at 5 Fatigue and take... 3 steps. I made the horrid, horrid (surely misogynistic!) comment of, "Wait, no, do it right--use up all but 1 Fatigue moving, THEN drink the potion to get it ALL back and keep moving on"--but she'd huffed and gotten up and fled to the bathroom (!) somewhere around the words, "all but 1."<br/><br/>OK, smoke break; everyone just take five and chill. Right?<br/><br/>Wrong. By the time the host and I had returned from taking five more minutes off our lives, she'd LEFT. Just, like, stormed out in a huff because I (or maybe anyone?) had presumed to show her an optimal way to use Fatigue... a technique which, in fact, is almost CRUCIAL to managing <i>Descent</i> resources, especially in tougher dungeons. [Frex, the grognards talk about "the range" of a hero all the time on the forums, and that range is, IIRC: 2 x Move + (2 x Fatigue -1).]<br/><br/>ANYHOW... epic fail to teach, epic fail to help others be awesome, epic fail to have fun (though, in my defense, her storming out did more to dampen the fun than my advice to use Fatigue more efficiently).<br/><br/><b>Lesson Learned:</b> I won't advise ANYONE on a game--even in a cooperative one, when he or she is increasing the odds of us losing--unless asked. Nicely. Repeatedly. Better to lead by example and let him or her WANT to learn the nuances. For example, in that very game, I had a guy with two free movement and Cleave (attack again if a Melee attack causes an enemy death). On ONE turn, I managed to kill five enemies spread across a 3 x 5 area through VERY careful use of a Battle action, Fatigue, and my free movement--a group record. I will simply wait for someone to (a) observe the merits of learning the synergies of the rules or (b) ask me how to best-execute a given term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247094/#Comment_247094" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T10:39:23+00:00" title="December 16, 2009 10:39AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2009 1:40PM by Daniel H..">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was supposed to superuse a playtest session of FreeMarket but was absolutely zonked from school and work that week.

It became clear I knew much less about the Victorian era than they did.<br/><br/>After the first few scenes, people were going off to get cups of tea, taking a suspiciously long time to return.

Gaming fails? I guess, insofar as gaming failed to distract us from more organic distractions.<br/><br/>Had a needy non-gamer girlfriend inject herself into the proceedings a couple times, which definitely put the damper on the "let's pretend we're something else" giddiness.

No, I didn't--quite literally the opposite.<br/>Do I recognize that I should change my approach with more-casual players? Yes, I do, I did in that post, and I really, really, gee-gosh-golly PROMISE I'll try to remember, pa!<br/>Did you know that she's actually played a variety of RPGs and board games, some as complex as D&amp;D 3E (just not lately and not ever routinely)? No, you didn't.<br/>Do you think her gender matters to me? No, it doesn't--I should have just filed that part off the story, but I was, like, setting the scene. I could have just used the English third-person, indeterminate pronoun of "it." *smacks forehead*<br/>Would you like to play with someone who won't learn what amounts to about four or five rules over the course of a total of about 13 hours of play over two sessions, but then throws a tantrum if you try to remind the person of one that will benefit him or her? (Set aside the given that you would--clearly, certainly--do it with more aplomb and finesse that *I* ever could.) I don't know about you... but *I* still will... but with reduced expectations: our team will be at a disadvantage, turns will take longer, I have to be "on guard" lest I get caught up in the moment and--HORRORS!--make an unsolicited suggestion. Yay, that's going to be SO much more fun than playing with folks who (a) will take time to learn the rules and (b) want to get better and so welcome advice that makes them more awesome.<br/><br/>But, you know... I'm a male, a gamer, and a failure as a person; it's blindly obvious from the handful of hastily-written paragraphs of mine that you've read, no? So... yeah. I'll go slit my wrists, because I just can't live with your disapproval....<br/><br/>(I find it... ironic?... that your only post in a "fess up to your fail" thread is to criticize a false conclusion that you've made about me.

They spend a lot of time making up characters.<br/>6) Like within 20 minutes of the start of the game, Gamer (GM) introduces an NPC Aysle Dwarf or something, who introduces a word puzzle to them.<br/>-- The solution to the puzzle is that you have to talk to him with your sentences beginning with a VOWEL, otherwise he can't hear or understand you. And only he can tell you what to do/where to go next. The GM improved this, its not a canon character or anything like that --<br/>7) Cut to 3 hours later. The players are bored out of their fucking skulls. They can't figure it out. They've gone beyond caring.<br/>GM kicks himself for not simply moving the action along, he attests that his brain simply froze up or something and he couldn't for some reason simply tell them the answer, nor move the action along.<br/>8) Players are totally soured on playing TORG, even though they did nothing "torg-like" at all at any point during the game. <br/>9) Gamer can't ever get them to play TORG again.<br/>10) Gamer ends up never running TORG again.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247344/#Comment_247344" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T11:49:49+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 11:49AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steven Marsh, the Torg story.

I had never played Vampire before and thought that this would be a great way to see if the new system appealed to me before spending money on it. I also thought that since it was a pre-release event the GM would be someone from the company or someone who had been through some sort of special training course running a pre-fab adventure to show off the new bits of the system. As we were sitting down to read our characters (I ended up with the crazy one, which will matter later) the GM started talking with a couple of the other players about how all the high school kids that were playing Vampire in Muncie were ruining the game because his character had 6 dots in [something that let him command other people], but they were ignoring his commands which would be impossible. This went on for 45 minutes. When we finally started the intro to the adventure was (no kidding) "the prince of Indianapolis has summoned you all to his club and tells you, 'something has been killing Vampires down in Muncie, I want you to go check it out.' He gestures behind him and some hidden drawers slide open. 'here are some guns, take one.' " As some of the other players tried to engage in some RP to find out more about the "mystery," I was passing notes with my friend pointing out some advice that Sean K. Reynolds had posted on his website to the effect that GenCon is too short for bad games. It is your time, if you can't make it better walk away. I looked at the GM and said in character. "I can't do that. The voices don't want me to leave Indianapolis." Then the two of us stood up, dropped our character sheets in front of him and walked off to the White Wolf booth to get our money back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247402/#Comment_247402" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T15:09:03+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  3:09PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 3:09PM by Rafu.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing <i>Geiger Counter</i> with a group of people half of whom haven't ever watched a horror movie.

The players were heavily into two aspects of gaming: <br/><br/>1. No railroading. The characters were to be given free reign to do what they wanted. No "plot", no "villains", just seamless fiction. I think some people call this "sandbox" style.<br/>2. What happens in game is as close as possible to "what would really happen". If the game's not challenging enough, or too challenging, tough luck. It's more important that it's all logical and believable. The game system is the physics of the game world, etc.<br/><br/>Generally, playing with them was fun. Just not very consistently. Well, this session was very much one of the less, uh, bad ones.<br/><br/>The player characters are flying their small spacecraft around a system they're investigating. One of the planets in-system is described by the GM as a small, icy planet. Scanners report no interesting features: just a ball of ice.<br/><br/>The players, of course, decide to investigate. The GM is all, "Are you sure? Like, there's not much down there, according to your sensors?" But the players really want to go look there (and there weren't really any better clues to what was on any of the other planets, anyway).<br/><br/>We fly down to the iceball on a little lander craft, leaving the main ship in orbit, and roll to land. Critical failure; some failure chart reveals that the craft is crippled as it slams into the ice. Some vital part is damaged; the thing won't fly right now.<br/><br/>So, there we are, twenty minutes into the session, crashed on an icy rock in the middle of nowhere (weeks of travel time from any other star system). Our craft is damaged, we don't have the means to repair it, and it is too damaged to take off again.<br/><br/>"How much oxygen do we have?"<br/><br/>About three hours, as had been established previously. Ironically, we had planned to play for another three hours. Well, we spent the next three hours doing everything we could think of. Sometimes the ideas warranted a roll (often with disastrous results); two of the PCs got into a brief fight. But no avail: there was no conceivable way to get off the planet.<br/><br/>By the end of the session, tension between the players was at an all-time high, with the GM blaming the players for going there and not making some kind of back-up plan, and the players blaming the GM for a terrible waste of three and a half hours (as well as, potentially, the previous year and a half of the campaign we were playing). Everyone was livid by the end, and went home truly pissed off.<br/><br/>These were intelligent, mature gamers in their 30s. I don`t know how they resolved the situation; I never played with them again (at least not in that campaign).<br/><br/>Oddly enough, it doesn`t stand out in my mind as the worst GAME FAIL of all time. But that`s even worse in a way: I`m pretty sure none of them thought it was that unusual an event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257495/#Comment_257495" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T20:28:34+00:00" title="February 21, 2010  8:28PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a con game of D&amp;D 3.5 collapse once when the DM and a paladin got into a typical paladin argument.<br/><br/>It ended with the paladin's player grabbing and ripping up everyone's character sheets. <br/><br/>The game pretty much ended after that, but it was getting boring anyways, so I think it was for the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257516/#Comment_257516" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T04:42:10+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  4:42AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a D&amp;D 3.5 game with a husband and wife, the hubby being the DM.

Me and the rest of the players sat on the couch and sorted through my Heroclix collection (and I was the only Heroclix player in the group).<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257904/#Comment_257904" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T12:36:53+00:00" title="February 23, 2010 12:36PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2010 12:38PM by phargle.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a game of GURPS Cyberpunk that died in a hail of Nerf bullets, after which we didn't get back to gaming that night, although that might not be a fail. <br/><br/>Once at GenCon, I played in a game run by "the best gamemaster in nine states" which mostly consisted of him trying to get somebody's pinocchio character to rape someone else's pinocchio character, and culminated in his lackey (who knew the plot already) resolving the adventure via cramming fireworks up asses.  I think that game was a bet to see if he could get people to pay to play in his game. <br/><br/>This other time, I ran Trail of Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I felt like an idiot for trying to play with them.<br/><br/>(Later I tried another library, where I met a group of adults who took me in, tolerated me, and basically awed me with their coffee cans filled with d4s.

I had a particularly reckless dwarven monk. We came across a pit of sand with arcane runes written in it. Everyone wanted to leave it alone, but I liked looking danger in the face, so I waded in and did as much as I could to mess up the symbols written in the sand. Everyone held their breath waiting for the inevitable nastiness to happen to me, but nothing did. Long story short, we got to the end of the dungeon and the symbols in the sand were actually part of a complex spell a lich had made that let him merge 30 or 40 undead creatures into one giant behemoth. Thanks to me disrupting the spell, they merged together in completely worthless ways and the thing basically collapsed in on itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258856/#Comment_258856" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T17:56:02+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  5:56PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Non-funny gaming fail:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is The Riddle of Steel. In TRoS, sorcerers can be absurdly powerful, and the Seneschal is advised to think carefully whether or not he can and wants to deal with that. I'd played the game for a while, and in several different campaigns. In all that Alex played in, he played a sorcerer. He's always played them well, without being power-gamey or min-maxy. This campaign was no different. At the point in the campaign when the gaming fail occurred, I was pushing a sub-plot involving an old... acquaintance of my wife's (girlfriend at the time) character. I was attempting to enliven what was, to me, a boring series of sessions and to give her some spotlight time. For the latter, I've never been one to play favorites for my wife; Quite the opposite. If I don't make a point to focus on her sometimes, she often gets relegated to a supporting role. For the former, the players were attempting to set themselves up in the high society of a major city, when I was getting impatient to get back to the "adventure". So, my wife's character was a former assassin, who left her guild (and family) on bad terms. An old mentor of hers began poking around, making subtly threatening gestures and overtures. Then shit went south, in a quickfast hurry. Alex, seeing the assassin as nothing but a threat and side-track, managed to get a material link to him, and was thus able to cast a spell on him without line of sight. I did everything I could think of to stymie him, but his insistence began to get on my nerves. Finally, I blew up, and told him that no matter what he rolled, he'd fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, obviously, didn't allow the game to continue smoothly. After calming down a bit, we discussed what had me so frustrated. Unless I broke the rules as I threatened, there was nothing I could do to keep him from rolling a few dice and blowing away a subplot that was intended to focus on another player. Rather than talk to him about it, I let it get to me to the point that things went sour. Adding to the frustration was my boredom with where the players were wanting to go, compared with where I wanted the story to go, and where I thought the players ALSO wanted to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it can be honestly said that the incident killed our gaming group. I admitted to being a little burned out on GMing, and wanting to put the campaign on hiatus. This caused some resentment, because, contrary to what I perceived, everyone was really enjoying the game, except for me. They attempted to roll with the punch gamely enough. Alex continued to run games on alternate play days, and Zach even tried to run a game or two, but it wasn't but maybe another month of limping play sessions (some of which were still pretty fun) before life somehow interfered and we stopped playing entirely. We managed to get the group back together for one last game shortly before I rejoined the Army and moved to Kansas, but we've not played together since.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is at least the second instance of me behaving badly that has caused problems in my gaming. It doesn't happen often, thankfully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258947/#Comment_258947" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T11:32:51+00:00" title="February 27, 2010 11:32AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2010 11:33AM by Joli.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About five years ago, my longtime gaming group found ourselves unable to play any of our regular campaigns due to a couple of key absences, and everyone was sitting around going "what to do, what to do?" I had just discovered the Forge and the Indie game scene, re4ad all the GNS essays, and purchased and read Primetime Adventures. Alluvasudden I had this vision of being the "brilliant Indie Design Guy" and Saving Gaming for the evening, so I said, "Hey, everyone! How about you all name one element you'd like to see in a game, and I'll try and whip up a quick game that we can play this evening?"<br><br>Everyone said "sure, I guess" and I ended up with a game element list of: Spaceships, Wolves, Zombies, <a href="http://i163.photobucket.com/albums/t289/Shad__2007/GantzSuitUpload.jpg" rel="nofollow">the skintight power suits from the manga/anime Gantz</a>, and...porn.<br><br>I looked at the list and thought, "what the fuck am I gonna do with these?" but my hands were tied, right? They gave their answers and I figured I had to accept them in good faith and do my best with them. So I retired to another room with a notebook for about 20 minutes, and you know what? I made a game. I made the best damn game I could in 20 minutes using those elements in earnest. The premise was that a massive colony ship in deep space had suffered system failures in many sectors, causing them to "go wild" and become the domain of feral beasts and escaped bio-experiments (wolves and zombies). There was a pocket of civilization in one sector which lived in decadent opulence, and an elite class performed orgiastic entertainments for the masses AND went out to the wild to keep the monsters at bay in skintight powersuits, in return getting to live out their lives in a lush pleasure-den. I made some rudimentary combat rules and some monster stats, and of course every character had an "Issue." It was supposed to evoke the pressures of soap-opera drama in a high-crisis, lethal lifestyle a la Strikeforce: Morituri or X-statix (but before X-Statix existed), while keeping the "porn" angle strictly in the background.<br><br>Well, we didn't play. While I was designing the rules, one regular GM took a player into yet another room for a solo scene "just for a few minutes." I wanted to hold off starting until they returned, because of COURSE a thematic, focused Indie design requires total player buy-in and participation. We waited. As the solo scene drew out longer and longer, I got impatient and knocked on the door, asking if they were almost done. They were surprised that I was waiting for them, and said I should just start without them. I said I kinda needed everyone on board to start off on the same page. The GM said that she didn't really want to play in a game with a "porn" theme anyway, and the other guy said that yeah, he didn't really feel like playing. Frustrated, and with playtime rapidly waning, I left them to their devices.<br><br>So I resolved to get started. The remaining three players heard my pitch. A couple started making up characters, but the <i>one who suggested porn</i> was like, "eh, I don't wanna play, it sounds too involved." The Gantz suit guy made a busty nymphomaniac with a "Chesty LaRue" or "Busty St. Claire" sorta name, who had an issue with men. The Zombie guy couldn't think of a character concept. I tried to help him, but nothing was coming together. By the time we were "ready" with one (joke) character, one player stuck for ideas, and a guy sitting in the corner palpably draining the room's creative energy with deliberate nonparticipation...it was too late. Like literally late in the evening, and me with no drive to continue. I just settled back and let the jokes about boobs, latex suits and lube continue to fly, and when the other two emerged from the other room (after 1, 1/12 hours, if I recall), they were surprised that we weren't playing. I went home utterly defeated and depressed, feeling rather icky about my friends' willingness to back me up.<br><br><br/><br/>It taught me a lot about A) the disastrous effects of overenthuisiastic idealism, pinning all one's hopes on THIS THING going EXACTLY RIGHT, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> The pure poison of uneven investment in the room, particularly a lack of reciprocity.

Dude was REALLY into Gantz and their power suits, and as long as I was giving him that, he was on-fucking-board.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259213/#Comment_259213" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T05:59:44+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:59AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Joel.<br/><br/>I can really relate to that. It's the intersection of "Let me impress them with this amazing Indie RPG Goodness!" and "The GM provides the fun for the group."<br/><br/>I can only wonder how many gamers who drink the indie Cool Aid go through that exact phase?<br/><br/>As I was reading your story, from today's perspective, I wasn't at all surprised that the guy who suggested "porn" was also the one least interested in actually playing. They kinda go together, those things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11128/gaming-fail" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11128/gaming-fail" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11128/gaming-fail/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11128%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11128%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
