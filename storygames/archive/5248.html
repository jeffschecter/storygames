I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them but I hate, hate, hate the scale - I prefer 1.5" squares - I know it's fucked up but I never claimed to be normal.<br/><br/>So let me know if these interest you and we can discuss their worth and trade arrangements.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
