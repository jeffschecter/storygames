To rectify that problem, I'll be running a game of the Moldvay edition with the B4 Lost City module this weekend. I chose the edition because I'd read here that it gives the most structure for DMs, and I can't say its not thorough. But as I give the rules a careful second pass, there's one thing that I don't get; doors.<br/><br/>On page 24, Moldvay says that dungeon doors need to be forced open, which requires players to roll a 2 or less on a d6 (modified by strength) to open them. First off, looking at the maps of the Lost City, there are tons of doors, and failing to force many of them could halt the adventure in a mind-boggling-ly boring way. So how do you use this rule? Do you ignore it? Do you only apply it to select doors? Do you allow players to reroll their check to knock down the door, and if so, why bother with the roll in the first place? What does this rule actually look like in action in at your table, and why does it add to the game?<br/><br/>I totally expect to have more questions as I finish digesting the rules, and I'll post them as they come. If other B/X noobs see this thread and want to post questions, that'd be awesome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390535/#Comment_390535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T10:03:18+00:00" title="September 17, 2012 10:03AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's just stuck doors and locked doors that you should use that rule for.

Moldway is a sufficiently ancient text to still carry about the text about opening doors, so if it doesn't say anything about the probability, then apparently it claims that all doors are always stuck.<br/><br/>Also, it might have made sense for all doors to be potentially stuck in an earlier dungeon environment that consisted of highly random and expansive megadungeons. In that sort of environment it's no big deal if the party can't go to a specific direction. The same principle hardly works with a module adventure that has intentionally considered pathways for the players to traverse. So you might be facing a rule that has already outlived its usefulness once you opt to use an adventure module.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I've found out in my own play that the natural interpretation of the various door-related routines is to consider the door a delaying element, not some sort of insurmountable barrier. A reasonably attired party <i>will</i> get an ordinary door open by one of any number of strategies (force it open, pick a lock, lift it off its hinges, use a lever to dislocate the lock, hack through it with an axe, set it on fire or whatever) as long as the GM actually rules fairly, so that's not the question. The only relevant question is whether their attempt to open the door causes noise or takes time, or both. This is why I use door opening checks: I want to see whether the party strongman manages to open the door in one mighty crash, or if whoever is on the other side gets a leisurely half an hour to prepare for the party as they break down the door the slow way.<br/><br/>This last point is the real answer to your question: if you do decide that all doors are naturally stuck (I believe this to have been the original intent, apparently all underground doors just naturally get sticky over time), then your motivation for using the door check is tactical. The stakes are surprise and time, remember that the party has limited supplies and random monsters to worry about. You well might make the roll once and then rule that as the door is too stuck it'll take an entire exploration round to get it to open - so all doors <i>can</i> be opened unless they're actually locked or barred, and it's just a matter of deciding whether they want to take the time.<br/><br/>Some people apparently get pleasure from playing all this dross by the book, but my own strategy is to simply ignore anything that doesn't make sense. For instance, in my campaign only the occasional door is stuck in the way Moldway implies (due to swelling of wood in the door and the frame), not every instance of the species.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390544/#Comment_390544" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T11:06:18+00:00" title="September 17, 2012 11:06AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I would say a roll like this would be not to determine if the party can pass the door, but how long it takes and whether or not they draw any unwanted attention in doing so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC" title="DavidTC"><img alt="DavidTC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC">DavidTC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390554/#Comment_390554" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T12:25:38+00:00" title="September 17, 2012 12:25PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2012 1:15PM by DavidTC.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool guys, thanks for the edification. Especially Eero, that makes a lot of sense. I think I'll go with "only apply this to stuck/locked doors, and don't assume all doors are stuck".<br/><br/>OK, issue number two: traps and thieves. Moldvay says on page 22 that checking for traps takes a turn and succeeding requires a roll of 1 on a d6. Level one thieves' "find/remove trap" skill gives them a 10 percent chance of success at the same task, which is actually worse. What gives? Over <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15909/a-tale-of-two-maps/p2" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a> John Harper suggests an interpretation that thieves skills represent the ability to act under pressure, like disarming a trap mid-combat. Is this common? Or do you handle thief skills some other way?<br/><br/>The rules also seems to imply that only a thief can remove a trap (but good luck with your pitiful skills). How does that fit in with "There's Always a Chance"? Do you allow other characters to try to disarm traps, and how does that play out at the table?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390587/#Comment_390587" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T15:03:23+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:03PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a classic question, and it seems that nobody knows a canonical answer. Applications vary widely.<br/><br/>I would suggest that you simply allow thieves to attempt both ways in situations where thief skills overlap with ordinary character capabilities (which is almost all the time; thief skills are not exactly special for the most part). This is a simple way to ensure that thieves are actually better at doing these things. In situations where ordinary people cannot hope for success you may still allow the thief to test his thief skill solely.<br/><br/>As for removing traps, that's more bullshit that's essentially caused by sloppy editing and low standards of quality in the early hobby. The game at the time had two contradicting currents of technical thought on this matter, so they both got stuck into many of the early rules editions. I would suggest that you follow the core method of allowing characters to do things they sensibly and realistically could do. That is, allow anybody to disarm a trap if the player manages to describe how they do it, and allow a thief to try an abstracted trap removal with a roll, with no need for the player to think up a method because the character figured it out.<br/><br/>Thieves in general are a mess in the game due to the half-assed way they were integrated. As you might know, thieves as a character class were only included in a supplement of the original game, which causes much of this systemic duplication.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390591/#Comment_390591" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T15:57:01+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:57PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, in the early 80s we always rolled for every door.

I've found that it is rarely important for me to even have firmly read the text ahead of time, as a large majority of the dungeon content is pretty limited strategically, only impacting single rooms. I anticipate player moves and while the players discuss what they're doing next, I on my part read ahead and plan how to run the content they're likely facing next. Sometimes when a particularly complex or unexpected encounter occurs I might take a couple of minutes of time-out, but that hardly bothers the players who tend to have more than enough on their plate all the time; usually they'd spend the 2-5 minutes I need in updating their inventories or planning their tactical plays, or whatever.<br/><br/>It is notable that this level of preparation falls badly apart if the module author has failed to clearly demarcate zones of effect for various dungeon content. For example, if you have a banshee in room A with a scream that affects rooms B, C and D as well, it's a major fault in your text if you do not reference the banshee in the description of each of those rooms separately. The alternative is a descent into madness as the GM has to study each and every room description in advance to make sure there are no multi-room tactical effects in each of them. A sensible adventure module thus either introduces long-range strategic concerns in the introductory text before the room key, or it clearly communicates the concern in each and every separate entry that is impacted by the strategic concern. Preferably both.<br/><br/>(Of course the most common multi-room concern are dungeon inhabitants that might hear or otherwise discern the party from afar, and these are not marked down in the way I suggest. However, in those cases the zone of effect is centered on the party, so I merely need to check the nearby rooms for possible alarm when the party makes noise.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, I definitely don't read boxed text, and in fact much prefer using modules that do not include this unnecessary and harmful boondoggle. The ideal module text is sparse and to the point, giving the GM maximum facts and flavour with minimal time spent in reading prose.<br/><br/>And yes, <i>Dyson's Delve</i> is a really nice dungeon. We've spent close to 20 sessions in there out of the 100 that our campaign has taken so far. (Still haven't discovered the evil temple, as the players took some time to learn how very bad-ass properly run goblins can be if the party gives them time to get on the warpath for real.) There are strategic concerns in there for GMs like me who insist on smart and realistic play, but if you're just happy to pretend that the goblins on level 2 know nothing about what happens on level 1, then you hardly need to prepare at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC" title="DavidTC"><img alt="DavidTC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC">DavidTC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390690/#Comment_390690" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T11:32:27+00:00" title="September 18, 2012 11:32AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 11:32AM by DavidTC.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys.

Since then there had been internal tension within the party between the players who favoured a goblin-friendly strategic policy and those who wanted to kill them and take their stuff. It's important to note that in this campaign I run goblins as basically aborogine human tribes; the players know this, although their characters are mired in racist 17th century thinking on the subject, with the occasional outliers and freethinkers. (This shift in goblin depiction is basically because I can't personally handle many of the more humdrum facets of Gygaxian fantasy. Just a color preference ultimately, everything I've done here could be done with traditional goblins as well.)<br/><br/>In the Temple the friendlies had won the day insofar as strategic thinking went: the party had patiently opened diplomatic relations with the stray tribe that had occupied most of the temple's upper floor, which ultimately resulted in some relatively lucrative trading (with some quest xp involved), tactical data on the dungeon and a semi-friendly base near the action. A couple more nature-oriented characters in the bunch became notably friendly with the goblins, even going so far as to gift them with a spiritually powerful giant frog carcass from the lower levels. There was even some Pocahontas activity with bride-taking and so on.<br/><br/>At the Delve, which I had situated about a hundred miles from the Temple as crow flies, the party had a bit higher level (average level 2 instead of 1, say), was a bit more numerous, and encountered goblins in a slightly different social context. The local sheriff paid a bounty on their ears (limited time only this summer due to tensions between the civilized folks and the savages), and several tribes were involved, for the Delve was right at the edge of the Goblin Hills, a wilderness highland dominated by the aborogines. Also, somewhat different player base.<br/><br/>So this time around the party was dominated by the hawks, and they were committed to claiming the riches of the goblins as the straightest way to prosperity (at the Temple they were left with the impression that the goblins had treasure they were keeping from its rightful owners). A few player characters had goblin-friendly personal commitments, including a character who was goblin himself, but they were not as influential; a pinch of intra-party conflict ensued, with the war-hawks emerging clearly victorious. This stance solidified over the initial encounters with the goblins, as the opportunities for peaceful communication grew sparse after violent altercations.<br/><br/>Now, the Delve in our campaign is about 25 miles from the nearest town and about 15 miles from any prominent civilized homesteads. The local wilderness encounter space includes goblins, most of which naturally are hunting or scouting parties of the tribe living on the upper floors of the Delve. What proved to be a real lethal problem for the adventuring party was the logistics of a) getting there unannounced, and b) leaving alive with any loot. The 1st floor of the Delve specifically mostly involves encounters with guard and scout elements of the goblin tribe that lives on the 2nd floor for the most part, so the goblins would usually know that the adventurers were in the dungeon, they would usually know that they're the same ones (or at least that they were "white" and coming from the same base town from whence the killers usually came). This was not a good space to be strategically for the party, as after the initial few thrusts into the Delve a pattern emerged between them and the goblins: the goblins would know that they were coming, so they would barrigade entry points and trap hallways to deter intruders, and after the adventurers left, goblin braves would follow them in the night, find out their campsite and kill as many as they could in the cover of darkness with an ambush. Brutal and bloody fighting.<br/><br/>There were some major setbacks in terms of character death to begin with, further confused by frankly over-optimistic attempts by some players to get the killing to stop - impossible to negotiate peace terms when they couldn't even get their own party to toe the line. A bit of ceasefire with weregild followed as some of the worst hawks skipped a few sessions, and the party managed to score some successes: the alternative route through level 1 is very lucrative due to the over-treasured ghoul on level 2, which caused the players to definitely feel that the Delve was a place to bother with despite the vibrant-seeming goblin tribe that now demanded a tax of 20% on anything they took up from the dungeon as a toll of free passage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390706/#Comment_390706" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T13:14:15+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  1:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After a few sessions of successful delving into the secondary route the hawkish outlook reasserted itself as the players started resenting the goblins who were amassing riches on their account. The players had limited understanding of the internal dynamics of the goblin tribe, but the lethal raids and counter-raids between the parties had sorely taxed the strictly limited population base of the tribe. When the adventurers again turned against the goblins the tribe answered with terminal tactics, such as setting large barrigade works in fire (with tame fire beetles hidden within for good measure) and retreating entirely to the second floor to defend their home and families.<br/><br/>Ultimately the vengeaful adventurers managed to wrest sufficiently stable control of the 1st floor to actually step into the actual goblin lair on the 2nd; the first such trip yelded much terror among the goblins, as the players had finally developed tactical doctrine that worked for their low-level party to a lethal overall effect. This first actual raid slew many goblins (mostly non-combatants at this point) and irrevocably turned the tribe towards the party; as the adventurers were elsewhere having other adventurers in the mid-summer, the goblins contacted their kin in the hills and begged for help. The tribe was now too weak to repel intruders on their own, but they were pretty wealthy, and they didn't want to give up on their home yet.<br/><br/>The goblin security upgrade involved bringing in a maternal family line of the chief for some fresh blood, and more significantly, hiring four ogres to take residence in a specific room (a former nursery) the adventuring party had cleared earlier by homicidal tactics. The surprise was pretty big for the party when they came back after a month or so, but to the surprise of everybody involved, they managed to triumph against this considerably tougher encounter. The internal parts of the 2nd floor were theirs for the taking.<br/><br/>(As a sort of secondary strategic thread the players had continued to occasionally delve on the secondary route through the catacombs. They'd managed to find a route that went <i>around</i> the goblin habitation, pretty directly to the 4th floor, or via 3rd floor to a back way into the goblin nest on the 2nd. Ultimately the players didn't utilize this back entrance except as a way to have something to do during sessions where some of the players didn't want to harass the goblins, but it did enable them to gauge the mood of the goblins throughout the war. For example, the players discovered a much weakened goblin community on 4th floor, where the original tribe residing in the dungeon had been moved after they called a stronger tribe for help. Obviously these goblins were not too happy to meet their tormentors when reduced to thrallhood in their own home, and their fate was ultimately a tragic one as the adventurers wiped them out altogether, thus now only leaving the outsider tribe to contest with them for the Delve.)<br/><br/>After the ogres were defeated and another raid managed to strike deep into the 2nd floor goblin nest, the goblins had had enough; winter was coming and due to the way the player character party had used their money and reputation back among the civilization there was a minor gold boom going, and other people were trying their luck in organizing expeditions to the Delve. It was pretty clear to the goblins that they had ultimately lost this fight: few were left of the originally prosperous tribe that had made their home here, and the goblins understood quite well that as had often been the case in the past, the civilized man was the stronger this time around as well: they had the numbers and the greed to fight the goblins into extinction.<br/><br/>Ultimately the goblin situation was resolved as the entire goblin community - what was left of both tribes - moved out of the dungeon during another period when the player characters weren't coming back weekly to the Delve. The next time they came there they found the going easy. Most of the goblin treasure was never found, though, so ultimately the goblin war proved a strategic failure for the adventurers: they had progressed too erratically and too conservatively, leaving the goblins time at every juncture to prepare defenses and retreat, ultimately retreating out of the dungeon altogether. That particular corner of our campaign sandbox is understandably the one where goblins and civilized humans get along the worst.<br/><br/>Hmm, that was a bit long. Still, that's the sort of wholistic strategic thinking that I like to employ as a GM: the dungeon offers dynamic challenges that adapt to what the party does over tactical and strategic time-frames. The dungeon levels are arbitrary boundaries from the viewpoint of the inhabitants, they're organized more along social lines. The Delve dungeon specification doesn't tell us who these or those goblins are, but as a GM running a coherent setting your task is to answer these questions for yourself. In my case it made sense to assume that the ferret-breeders on the first floor were a guard and hunting party section consisting of young adult males, while the larger 2nd floor community had the rest of the tribe. The 4th floor goblins were interestingly explained as a result of PC activity despite being there in the dungeon spec all along.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC" title="DavidTC"><img alt="DavidTC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC">DavidTC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390723/#Comment_390723" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T14:50:10+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  2:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Eero, that's incredible.

For what's it worth I think that this is the closest to the technical mode of how early D&amp;D is supposed to be interpreted as a game text; you discern the method of the game and expand on the actual procedures accordingly as agenda dictates. It's simply not a complete game in the modern sense of having been described exhaustively - more like campaign notes, really, up until AD&amp;D (which has its own issues).<br/><br/>(Sorry if it seems that I'm mixing up your Moldway exploration with my personal heresies. Playing "just Moldway" just doesn't make sense to me, so I might be blabbing about stuff that's entirely irrelevant to you. I'll explain below, but please take this as just me musing about my personal D&amp;D philosophy. If there's something useful in it, that's good, but if not, no big deal.)<br/><br/>Regardless, the answer to your question is that I interpret early D&amp;D agenda first: it was created as a game that enables players to armchair-adventure in fantasy environments. The fact that the game went through several "basic" editions (Moldway, Cook, Mentzer) that intentionally limit themselves to the dungeon and forgo discussion of the strategic scope does not reflect the true reality of how the game was played since the first campaign; it was always primarily about cooperatively inventing challenging adventures (that would probably have a heavy dungeon element, but not necessarily) in a vivid and life-like world, and then resolving those adventures through a procedure that challenges the player team's ability to coordinate, innovate, take risks and make purposeful choices.<br/><br/>Considering this viewpoint, it's not difficult to take a specific game text like say Moldway and see how the whole game logically expands out of that. The text may have been written intentionally to limit it into a specific discrete sector of the game, but there are no real boundaries put to it; nothing in the game's structure <i>prevents</i> either the GM or the players from exploring beyond the material provided. I would assume that nearly any group that played Moldway in campaign mode did this: the game text clearly assumes that the group will <i>somehow</i> resolve the strategic environment surrounding the dungeon, and the obvious way to do that is by expanding the game procedurally and starting to talk with the players about it. I guess you could keep all of that under GM control and just have the GM narrate what happens in between dungeon excursions (or even not talk about it at all), but that starts to immediately impinge pretty badly on such basic issues as shopping for equipment and trading non-monetary treasure. It's just more natural to roleplay the strategic layer than to pretend that it doesn't exist.<br/><br/>As for how to learn to do all this, that there's a serious dilemma for D&amp;D. I am horribly critical of D&amp;D game texts while simultaneously being utterly in love with the real game hiding below the dross, so I guess my take would be that the best way to learn how to do the full game would be to play with others who know how to play it. D&amp;D is at its best in the oral culture, which can be seen in how the blogosphere has been beating the pants off official writing over the last decade - the very clearest, most incisive D&amp;D texts lately have either been private introspection about private play style, or elsewise entirely newly written game texts that rely heavily on the same as their main element. Official rulebooks are left in the dust, both modern and the original ones. They simply never had the terminology and writing method for capturing the game in a satisfactory way, I guess.<br/><br/>Of course all that is more of a campaign issue, the strategic concerns in a one-shot are much more constrained. I do in fact agree with those who find the basic series of early D&amp;D game texts (original, Moldway, Cook, all the way up to Mentzer and progeny) surprisingly functional and fun games in their own right. The decision to limit the game's concerns to the dungeon makes up for the inability of the TSR-era writers to discourse clearly on the method of play; a text like e.g. Moldway surely includes almost everything you'd need for a one-shot or a short campaign that mostly limits itself to one dungeon and shallow strategic issues (e.g. restocking the dungeon, which comes up even if you play just a couple of sessions).<br/><br/>All in all I wouldn't worry about this stuff if I were just planning to try out the dungeon game for a session or two. Just keep an open mind so that if the players reach out for the setting you don't brush them aside. I've done some one-shotting, and the best newbie D&amp;D players <i>will</i> try shenanigans as soon as the first session if the game's fictional environment inspires them. For example, if the players want to get back to the civilization to get some specialized equipment for the dungeon, you should be willing to work with them even if the rulebook doesn't have anything about how to establish the expense of doing so (time and money and maybe wilderness threats). D&amp;D just doesn't like it if you put unrealistic limits on it, players should be able to think of solutions within the game world on terms that make sense in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC" title="DavidTC"><img alt="DavidTC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC">DavidTC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390734/#Comment_390734" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T16:15:15+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  4:15PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again Eero!<br/><br/>Now I'm curious about what other SGers who run Moldvay think about this.

To build off of what he has said and my own experience, the thing about "D&amp;D" when you're coming at it from a Story Game type perspective is that the early editions were not written with much concession given to "completeness". Especially the original edition was a hobbyist product that was more a set of guidelines and "hey, here's how we figured out this thing that came up in our game, you can use it too!" Moldvay and the other Basic editions were far more systematized and clarified, but the default answer of early D&amp;D is "the referee decides". Sometimes that means "the referee decides because it makes sense", other times it means "the referee decides by consulting a random table", and occasionally it means "the referee decides because it seemed like a good idea at the time". <br/><br/>Anyway, to more directly answer your question, as I said, my campaign is still in its first few sessions and for dealing with "everything outside of the dungeon", I'm hacking together some stuff from Dungeon World and Kevin Crawford's "Red Tide" and "An Echo Resounding" that looks at this stage like it's going to mostly be an expansion of Dungeon World's Fronts and Steadings incorporating more random tables, and adding in some Domain Level play stuff from "An Echo, Resounding".                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390757/#Comment_390757" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T20:04:43+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  8:04PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 8:05PM by akooser.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DavidTC">@DavidTC</a><br/>Luke Crane has a whole bunch on playing Moldvay with just the rules in the book.<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15909/a-tale-of-two-maps/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15909/a-tale-of-two-maps/p1</a><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/111266966448135449970/posts/Q8qRhCw7az5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/111266966448135449970/posts/Q8qRhCw7az5</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?12395-Let-s-talk-about-Luke-s-D-amp-D-explorations&amp;highlight=moldvay" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?12395-Let-s-talk-about-Luke-s-D-amp-D-explorations&amp;highlight=moldvay</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390758/#Comment_390758" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T20:07:25+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  8:07PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DavidTC">@DavidTC</a><br/>Here in NM we ran a straight Moldvay game over the lunch hour as written for awhile.

Anything else like healing, getting curses removed by high level clerics, buying+selling stuff, training to gain new levels, finding henchmen (we play troop-style) etc happens in a abstract place that is "outside the dungeon AKA the village" and which is always safe (but not always predictable as the availability of some things like henchmen need to be rolled for).<br/><br/>Whilst not having the depth of Eero's game, IMO this is a perfectly satisfactory way to play a pickup game. Instead of introducing further wilderness/economic strategic concerns the PCs must still get in/out of the dungeon alive as well as getting to a place of interest. Getting out after a long delve should always be a concern for the players, leading to much hand-wringing about when it is time to head back. This has the advantage that the Moldvay game does provide mechanical support for this eg in the form of wandering monsters, supplies of torches, HP, etc. Some DM innovation in terms of keeping the dungeon "alive" will improve your game but as you say there is no mechanical support for this. However a little will go a log way (the PCs will be confused enough!) and over time PCs can turn areas of dungeon into barren wastelands that take less maintenance :-) <br/><br/>Basically I'm saying don't be intimidated by Eero's cool-sounding game, its possible to work up to something like that if desired but I think that the Luke Crane links show how just faffing about with 10 foot poles in the dark can be fun for a while anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
