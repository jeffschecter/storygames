I've served this year and once before in 2007.<br/>\nIf anyone is interested in seeing the way I judge and the kinds of products I vote for you can check out my blog at http://enniejudge.blogspot.com  It does a better job of describing my judging style and the sorts of things I look for in a product far better than I could here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly I believe that the judging process should:<br/>\nBe open and honest.<br/>\nServe the needs of the community and the publishers and fans that support it.<br/>\nJudge each product on its own merits, rather than against one another.<br/>\nTake into consideration the thoughts and preferences of others.<br/>\nBe receptive to questions and critisism.<br/>\nBe responsive to those who take their time to offer input.<br/>\nI hope that in my terms I have met those goals, and I promise to continue to strive toward those ends should I be elected again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find yourselves so inclined I'd appreciate it if you could take a few moments and vote on the perspective judges at http://www.ennie-awards.com/voting/jvoting.asp  A lower number is a better vote, and voting for more than one person is a good way to ensure that your vote still counts, even if your first choice doesn't make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time, and any support you can offer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222103/#Comment_222103" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T16:19:15+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  4:19PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy, I don't know what code you used after the list, but could you turn it off?

My name is Mark Green and I'm a 2010 ENnies Judge candidate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't bother to re-post all my answers to the questionnaire here; you can view that online at http://www.ennie-awards.com/nominations/j_green.asp<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that I'm strictly a hobby enthusiast and not an "industry guy." In other words, gaming isn't part of my profession. I don't write reviews for a living and I've never worked for a gaming company. I play strictly for fun and have been gaming for 25 years, the last 10 of which have been with my current group. Most of that time, I've been a GM, but I like to take a break as a player once in a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played alot of games along the way (including board games, miniatures, and card games). My mainstay will always be fantasy RPG, with my original "Red Box" Basic D&amp;D set and 3.5 OGL competing for favorite. I also enjoy all things Star wars (WEG d6 and Saga). Mouseguard is a recent favorite as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I have my favorites, I will be open and objective as a Judge. I love both the crunch and the flavor and like to see a nice balance between the two. Originality is always appreciated, whether it is original mechanics, concepts, or even just an interesting twist on a staple concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you take the opportunity to vote in the coming week, and especially that you decide to vote for me as a Judge for the 2010 ENnies. For me, that would offer an awesome opportunity to give something back to the gaming community.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Megan" title="Megan"><img alt="Megan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Megan">Megan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222174/#Comment_222174" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T07:49:38+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  7:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello, I'm Megan.

I recently discovered that one of the people I play with plays a fantastic leader-type of character (it can be tough to do just right) when we did Mouse Guard, and I've been playing the crap out of Starblazer Adventures (Shadowrun, Star Wars, and Mechwarrior variations so far).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222440/#Comment_222440" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T11:27:42+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 11:27AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Failing that, I'll vote for any judge who hasn't posted here, just to discourage the temptation to post because all the other judges have posted.</blockquote>\nThe judge nominees received an email with links to the threads on a variety of boards, so you may want to consider that holding it against judge candidates for posting in the judge candidate thread might not be the coolest thing.

Our group plays a huge amount of FATE, specifically Spirit of the Century, and I'm prepping for a Starblazer Adventures campaign now.

As part of the judging process this year I ran Dread for the first time to playtest a pretty amazing adventure that was entered for the system.  Don't Rest Your Head,and Cold City are two of my absolutely favorite games, and I have played, but not run, both Dogs in the Vineyard and PTA.<br/><br/>All of this has stemmed from my experience with the awards.

My experience with traditional games stems largely from the fact that those types of games are what my players prefer.  The fact that I try to make the games I run as story-driven as possible is my way of injecting some of my own preferences into the game my players want to play.  Story-driven games with rich backstory and an organic feel to the NPCs are what I shoot for.  I want my game world to feel functional and not forced (orcs aren't in the dungeon because I want the party to encounter orcs in the dungeon, they are there for their own reasons and motivations).<br/><br/>If you'll read my profile, you might notice that I also mention Mouse Guard as something I've played in the last year and have enjoyed a great deal.  Mouse Guard is a great game and an excellent example of how the kind of story game that I like.  <br/><br/>But in the end, the real answer to your question is that I want to give everything that comes my way and fair, honest shake.  I *want* to find the best gaming material out there and I want to see the best games win awards because that's good for the hobby.  If my answer doesn't move you to vote for me, that's cool.  Not every candidate can be every voter's favorite judge.  All I can ask is that you also give me a fair shake<br/><br/>Hope that helps.<br/><br/>-Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222629/#Comment_222629" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T03:49:38+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  3:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 5:31AM by Graham.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Skeld</cite>As Mr. Richeson touches on, we received a list of links to announcement threads on various boards.

Different strokes for different folks.<br/><br/>Personally, when I've voted for judges in the past, I have preferred that they come to the forums I use regularly and open themselves up for comments and questions.  That shows me they have a willingness to engage.  <br/><br/>If someone making an effort to come here and listen to you what you have to say makes you less likely to vote for them, that's certainly your prerogative.  It seems a bit contrary to me, but you and I seem to have different viewpoints.

The game mechanics are just there for task resolution, they're not the GAME itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I look at a game system, be it something in my own vast collection, off of my 'review pile' or - if I get elected - an ENnies submission, the main thing I am looking for is, how will this product support and enhance your gaming experience, contribute to the alternate reality you and your friends are building round the table (or online). One of the best things that has come from reviewing is that I am often sent something I literally wouldn't have looked at in a store, and yet once I start reading it I find out what a mistake passing it by would have been! <br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn't mean I'm uncritical, there are things in the teetering piles of books or on my RPG hard drive that probably won't ever come out again, yet I'll still try to assess them fairly when reviewing... after all, I might not care to play a game about talking trees, but someone else out there might be longing for one, so I'll try and give as good an impression as I can of how well that product could work in the hands of someone who wants to play that game. (Come to think of it, talking trees might be quite amusing... I remember once rigging a fellow gamer's beer glass with a micro-speaker and having it talk to him until he wondered just how much he had had! But I digress...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the oddest things I was once asked after I'd been running a game was, "Did we do what we were supposed to do?" I was a bit baffled. What was he SUPPOSED to do? As GM I'm setting a scene, with a whole load of people doing their own stuff... it's up to the players, through their characters, to interact with it all. What if they decided that my Big Evil Guy had the right idea and decided to help him rather than hinder him? That's their choice, it'd be my job to run with it and determine what the results, the consequences would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, voting ends tomorrow, so if you have not yet voted please consider doing so. If you have - and irrespective of whether you vote for me or not - thank you for participating in the ENnies process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Megan" title="Megan"><img alt="Megan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Megan">Megan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224822/#Comment_224822" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T05:05:37+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  5:05AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The results are now in... thank you to everyone who participated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2010 ENnies Judges are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.
