(The Pool, Inspectres, Wilderness of Mirrors, In a Wicked Age, Archipelago)<br/><br/>Frex:<br/><br/>The Pool - you've written some statement about your character and what they want, like "I want to find my father's killer." You make a roll and get your MoV. So you say, "... and then my father's killer walks into the room and confesses and I (forgive/kill) him"<br/><br/>Misery Bubblegum - you have your Dream - maybe it's to escape with one of the other PC's to a better life. So you play the high card and nobody can trump you. So you narrate "...and I convince Joanna to come with me and we escape to a better life."<br/><br/>Inspectres - you're investigating something - but instead of giving yourself a small clue with your narration rights, you say "...and then the evil mastermind comes out and says, 'You have gotten too close to discovering my evil plan!' but he slips on a banana peel and we capture him."<br/><br/>Wilderness of Mirrors - say your mission is to save the discovered mole.  you win narration rights and say "...and then we find a secret passage that bypasses all the dangers we spent an hour designing and it leads right to the cell where they're holding the mole, and we escort him out."<br/><br/>In a Wicked Age - you've got your best interest, let's say it's to get pregnant by the harvest god. You're in a conflict. They challenge "I stab you in the eye" and you answer in a way that they don't get what they want but they have the advantage, so you say, "I duck and escape into the woods, where I meet and get impregnated by the harvest god, but you catch up with me in the act, and are standing over me with the knife as he sows his seed..."<br/><br/>Archipelago - you've got your destiny "will I become king?". you get to frame your own scene, so you say, "All right, it's my coronation ceremony, and the high priest is putting the crown upon my head ..."<br/><br/>Usually, when playing with vets, these problems never come up ... that's been my experience, anyway. Why is that? (I have some theories but I'd like to throw it open first.)<br/><br/>Some of these games, if rookies to narration rights pick up the game, then the problems reveal. Not because the rookies are being dicks: it's just because they think that's how they're supposed to play, or maybe they're used to games where you win, or maybe they're testing the system.  Some of the games continue to work anyway even with rookies testing the limits. Why do some of the games work - and others not? (Again, I have some theories, but ... )                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333040/#Comment_333040" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T10:14:55+00:00" title="July  4, 2011 10:14AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2011 10:17AM by JDCorley.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not super-familiar with all these games, but:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Wilderness of Mirrors - say your mission is to save the discovered mole.  you win narration rights and say "...and then we find a secret passage that bypasses all the dangers we spent an hour designing and it leads right to the cell where they're holding the mole, and we escort him out."<br/></blockquote>\nThis actually breaks the rules of the game, because the GM gets to create complications and force them on people.  That's the only place that complications actually come from. It's more or less assumed you will get past the dangers you <i>knew</i> about, so that's not a problem.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>In a Wicked Age - you've got your best interest, let's say it's to get pregnant by the harvest god.

If there's a game that gives you narrational authority and says "your goal in this game is to get your character to their goals", there's no reason, n00b or not, that someone shouldn't run straight at the goals the first chance they get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333042/#Comment_333042" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T10:38:31+00:00" title="July  4, 2011 10:38AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><br/>The Pool - you've written some statement about your character and what they want, like "I want to find my father's killer."

We're playing "The Mountain Witch."  We all know the genre, and we're actively trying to emulate it.  Nobody spontaneously says in act one "I know O-yanma is supposed to meet me here, by this twisted tree, because my Dark Fate is telling me so, but I've had a change of heart, and now I kill him.  Anyone want to join up with the dice?"<br/><br/>Because such play is antithetical to the genre.<br/><br/>Most games don't bother with rules to lock down your play, because they assume a playstyle or they assume a set of genre tropes.  I doubt there are many authors out there who would write down all their assumptions, or even care to.<br/><br/>Take Puppetland, for instance.  It's wide open and the players are free to narrate almost anything, but in Puppetland there's a game-mechanics sponsored feedback channel to tell players they're out of the genre.  When they cuss or swear or murder or do things that aren't in line with a children's puppet show, they get a black mark on their character sheet.  Fill that sheet up, and that puppet won't come back next session.<br/>But there aren't any rules to handle what to do with the puppet until the end of this session.  Are they free to go on a murdrous rampage?  Swear until everyone's ears bleed?  Violotae the nearest sheep puppet in an orgy of debauchery?<br/>Nothing in the rules says you can't, and indeed, there isn't even any game-mechanic feedback to prevent you.<br/><br/>The underlying assumption that keeps everyone going is the genre you're emulating.  It's all the agreement that the group has about how to use the rules of the game.  Without wich, all games are teetering on the edge of madness and ruin.<br/><br/>But hey, sometimes I like a little risk, myself.<br/><br/>As for the Rookies / Vets thing, I find most often that it falls along people sympathetic to the theme.  Run an anime game for Western gunslingers, and they short-cut the game and shoot holes in it.  Run a sci-fi game for ren faire geeks, and they do the same.<br/><br/>Until the underlying themes appeal to the player, (or until you find a player who is willing to look for the theme and enjoy it, no matter what it is) you're going to find people who shoot their load early and skip the foreplay.  Don't burn yourself out.  <br/><br/>Hope this helps.  Feels a little ranty to me, so I apologize if that's the way it sounds to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333050/#Comment_333050" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T11:29:30+00:00" title="July  4, 2011 11:29AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing new players often do is test limits. <br/><br/>They may narrate "I win" just to see if they can. <br/><br/>You sometimes see this with GMless games.

So, if it's the scene where you and Joanna are having that discussion, and you win, absolutely you can narrate, "...and I convince her to come with me." That escaping to a better life thing? Off the table, because it's not "next" - you'd need more scenes to resolve it.<br/><br/>But if it's not that scene, and instead it's a scene about who ends up getting embarrassed at prom, your rights don't extend far enough to give you that option in the first place.<br/><br/>The issue at hand seems to be that you're equating "inviolable" with "unconstrained". In every one of the example games you mentioned, constraints exist on your narration rights - sometimes enforced by the rules, sometimes enforced by the social contract. Could some games do better at defining where the boundaries are? Maybe.

The book says "in your answer, you have to say what happens and what [your character] does, that prevents [your opponent] from carrying out his action, but leaves [your character] at the disadvantage." So, technically, the example did say "what happens and what I do," but adding on a rider (not just "I escape and run into the woods" but "I escape and run into the woods and have AN ENTIRE SEX SCENE, which you come in at the end of")  might be dirty pool. Or it might not. Depends on the group.I don't think IAWA has any stipulations on how big a span of time "say what happens" covers, but I expect people's default assumptions will be that it's limited to actions within the scene.<br/><br/>But that probably doesn't get at your central question. for that we have to look at the Best Interests themselves. When you create BEs you don't just say whatever. For players, you "look at other characters and guess where they're going to be strong. Cast your character's best interests against them there." For the GM, you "ruthlessly threaten the players' characters, where they're weakest." So all the BEs will be aimed at other characters, and consequently other players. So, "impregnated by the Harvest God?" That's a BE that you aimed at a character. If the Harvest God, is a PC or NPC, they're going to have some agency in the matter. It's out of bounds to say what they do. If the player of that character is <i>willing </i>to impregnate you, then great! Otherwise you've got to get in conflicts, negotiate, etc. If by some chance the God isn't a character--and this is REALLY an outlier, because it requires <i>someone</i>, a priest maybe, for your BE to be set against, <i>and </i>requires the GM to say "nah, I guess i'll pass on playing the Harvest God"--then great! You can say you got impregnated by the Harvest God! Good for you! Unless the dagger-person in the example was specifically trying to stop you from getting impregnated by the harvest god, then yes, you win. Nothing wrong with that; it's how the game works. There's nothing wrong with that; it's how the game works. (and you're apparently about to be stabbed, which is ALSO how the game works!)<br/><br/><b>Archipelago</b> This one is really easy. You set the scene that way, and someone says "Try a different way" and explains that getting crowned right off is pretty unsatisfying, and the Destiny would be more interesting if we were to progress toward it gradually. If you still insist, "no, I really want to begin with the Coronation," then someone says "that might not be so easy!" and you've got to draw a card for a "Yes, and" "No, but" etc outcome, which may get you crowned king or may not, and at the very least will take your story in a new direction.<br/><br/>It's also possible that some player might have Ownership of Monarchy, or politics, or ceremony, or whatever, and be able to say "no, the way coronations work is, you've first got to..."<br/><br/>Archipelago is great for this. It has explicit tools for adjusting play based on individual sensibilites and expectations, and getting on the same page with tone and content.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, in the first example, IAWA works with this kind of input because A) there are some barriers the rules throws up to prevent it happening, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> if you manage to overcome or avoid those barriers, it's fine to do it! "Winning" Best Interests early and often is just standard, on-spec IAWA play.<br/><br/>In the second example, Archipelago works with this kind of input because it has tools for the players to refine best practices <i>as they play</i>, until they arrive at something that works for everyone.<br/><br/>The thing you're worrying about, Jamie--players describing victory too soon--seems tangled up in another issue, which is just players describing TOO MUCH at a go. That is often an issue with green players (Experienced RPG folks can err in the opposite direction, assuming that the ONLY thing the can or should describe is "I swing at him."). If it matters for a particular game or group, it probably bears having a talk about how small or large an increment of narration should be. it's an issue that will hopefully grow smaller and smaller as game texts refine their clarity about what players do moment-to-moment.<br/><br/>The bottom line for <i>me </i>is simply being true to the fiction's integrity. I think that's an underlying assumption in most roleplaying games, though the text doesn't always address it clearly. Most of your examples border on meaningless because they lack a context of what fictional events led up to the narration. "You make a roll and get your MoV. So you say, '... and then my father's killer walks into the room and confesses and I (forgive/kill) him.'" Uh, ok...but what was the roll for? What were you trying to achieve? What was happening in general, what were other characters doing? If the roll's completely unrelated to your father, if no scene-setting or character actions remotely suggests that your father might appear...then maybe you're not being true to the integrity of the fiction. Again, with the IAWA example: what was the conflict about? Why is he trying to stab you? Was there anything in the story thus far that suggests that a forest tryst with the Harvest God might be around the corner?<br/><br/>I think gamers generally <i>expect</i> only fiction-appropriate actions, but often look to the rules to provide this, by quantifying the range of fiction-appropriate actions and walling off areas that are inappropriate. So when they see a game deliberately leave those walls out, they think "oh, anything goes," and can almost feel a DUTY to narrate nonsensical shit that even <i>they </i>don't enjoy. That said, though, I think this problem is rare in practice. I've seldom seen it. Generally, I mostly see people describing what makes sense to the situation, with occasional excesses.<br/><br/>Like I said, game texts aren't always clear on this point. If I may toot my own horn, the Dreaming Crucible has the rule <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/principles-of-play/" rel="nofollow">Say What You See</a>, which invites players to treat the fiction with integrity and describe what they really see, not what they think would be coolest and most clever. It's gone well. I will admit, it helps that Crucible is a Faerie journey game, so it encourages a bit of wild and sweeping narration. And I also explicitly wall off the end goal by saying it doesn't happen until a resource is depleted, so there's that, too.<br/><br/>Peace.<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333055/#Comment_333055" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T12:03:16+00:00" title="July  4, 2011 12:03PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh jeez, cross-posted with EVERYBODY.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333056/#Comment_333056" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T12:07:52+00:00" title="July  4, 2011 12:07PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2011 12:46PM by jdfristrom.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to make a game for new players, to help spread the goodness, though Fiasco already does it so well I'm not sure if I should bother.<br/><br/>So what I hear you guys saying so far is it's an insolvable problem - rookies will lack the simulation mindset / they will test and hopefully they'll move beyond that but there's also a good chance they'll say "this is silly" and give up, little knowing the riches that await them on the other side of the learning curve - but I don't believe that.<br/><br/>Fiasco, for example, has super-strong narration rights but you can't narrate "I win" - because no matter how good you make things for your character as you play, the game is still going to run for 4*n scenes and the dice will still seal your fate at the end ...<br/><br/>(This was cross-posted with the last 3 or 4 posts, btw.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333058/#Comment_333058" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T12:40:05+00:00" title="July  4, 2011 12:40PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing people are saying is that you misrepresented or minimized the rules or procedures that make narration rights work in the example games you used.

Golf, because it is played by self-important jack-asses, has to have rules of etiquette. When four self-important jack-asses are stuck waiting behind four other self-important jackasses who are in turn held-up by four other self-important jackasses, there have to be rules.<br/><br/>So.

Maybe this is again my love of "what is roleplaying?" sections in RPGs, but what you're describing is a game in which the role of the player is NOT to push the character strongly towards their goals with all the tools at their disposal, but is instead to do something else, to preserve a genre, or promote a feeling, or what have you. This is not a bad idea, but it is not really what I take Jamie to be asking about.<br/><br/>Really the issue is what the job of everyone at the table is. One of the advantages of having a regular ole normal GM is that everyone else can grab their character and run at the goal line as hard as they can, the GM will trip them up and knock them down.  In a game where you might have control over the things between your character and their goals, it's a legitimate question what <i>your</i> role is.  If what you're here to do is help your character get what they want or need, then you're a fool if you don't use your narrational power to destroy all opposition. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, it's that you are talking about a different set of games, where that's not what you're at the table to do (or not the only thing you're at the table to do.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333084/#Comment_333084" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T15:49:26+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  3:49PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All roleplaying games have to deal with this, the absolute narrative authority thing is a red herring. Either the players will priorize the robustness of the fiction to some degree in the first place, in which case that's the level of robustness you can rely on for the game, or they won't, in which case they will break the game in whatever manner they're allowed to. Even with something like D&amp;D they will constantly have their character try impossible things, so stupid and insipid that the GM can only shake his head and ignore it to make the game go on.<br/><br/>This is not to say that individual games can't make it easier to avoid such abuse and make it more obvious so it's easier to spot and call. Teaching methodology is also useful: if you can make players understand the underpinning form of the game better, then they'll be less likely to play against the spirit of the game. Thus it's not entirely correct to say that this is only a problem for jerks: it's true that this will always be a problem for jerks no matter the quality of the game, but we can only make sure that honest players can coordinate towards good play by planning the game well in pedagogical terms.<br/><br/><i>Zombie Cinema</i> is a game with both "unlimited" narration rights and character advocacy. The game text explains to you that your mission as advocate is to express your character's interests and determine how the character strives towards his interests. It goes on to state that sometimes the player is not advocating, but rather has the task of narrating events to their conclusion. These are two separate roles the player switches between as necessary - this should be pretty clear to us all here, what I mean by saying that you're not supposed to sublimate your character's interests into the narration duties you sometimes have: the fact that your character wants somebody dead has nothing whatsoever to do with you the player, you're well able to narrate for us for a minute without letting your character's interests get in the way. This is true for all games in this tradition, beginning with <i>Dust Devils</i>.<br/><br/>Notably Zombie Cinema does not have any actual mechanics or much in the way of structure to help avoid abuse of the above: if you miss the distinction the rules make due to preconceived notions or laziness, or if you choose to ignore it, the game is pretty helpless about it. The most likely way for the other players to intercept your abuse of the narrative powers will be when you overstep the purpose of that narrative role and start extending it from the current conflict to unrelated events in the story: here there is a good chance that another player will interrupt and ask you to keep your narration to the topic at hand, your character's victory in conflict. This is, however, merely treating the symptoms: the disease is the fact that you're mixing up your separate roles as a co-narrator and as a character advocate, and the fact that your narration is biased and pointless is merely a symptom of this misunderstanding. The problem will be corrected once you as a player truly accept that you have not only the privilege of immersing in your character, but also the duty of being a fair and level-minded co-author occasionally, when the game requires a coordinating hand.<br/><br/>Also, I've definitely seen the first scene climax in Mountain Witch. Seems ridiculous, but a certain type of inexperienced and uncertain roleplayer will do it because they can't wrap their head around the notion of dramatic pacing. A large motivation for me in writing Zombie Cinema was to teach pacing to players who lack this skill. I probably won't forget the awkwardness of a certain guy's "now I kill you other PC for burning down my library" scene very soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333085/#Comment_333085" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T15:58:48+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  3:58PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of our games are a constant struggle against one of the players saying "I win".

Yes, that can happen, but the reason for that is not because their job as players in D&amp;D is to get their characters to their characters's goals. (Do you know what the job of a player in Your Favorite Edition of D&amp;D is? Are you <i>sure</i>?  D&amp;D3's description may surprise you if you haven't read it in a while!)  There are many reasons for that kind of behavior, yes. That's a real thing, yes.  But it isn't related even to the stunted, wrong definition of "advocacy" that people have come to use, let alone to actual advocacy.  Someone trying stupid things, in my experience, is really just "trying things out", pushing boundaries, "seeing what would happen if".  It is normally absolutely unrelated to anything resembling a character goal (or best interest).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333100/#Comment_333100" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T19:35:42+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  7:35PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 7:48PM by orklord.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><br/>Inspectres - you're investigating something - but instead of giving yourself a small clue with your narration rights, you say "...and then the evil mastermind comes out and says, 'You have gotten too close to discovering my evil plan!' but he slips on a banana peel and we capture him."<br/></blockquote>\nAnd if the players don't have enough Franchise Dice to meet the number needed for the mission, they've either abandoned the job somehow or... this isn't really the mastermind.

I added an area to their character sheet that listed all the PC's names and had space for writing how they knew and felt about each other.

"Fun" is what the game is surely intended to produce, and if I believe my role in the game is to push hard for my character's goals/needs, then what you're really saying is  "well, the game doesn't produce fun if you do what the game asks you to do".  Instead, say:<br/><br/>"Hold up, let's take a step back. If you do that, your guy will achieve their goals (or get what they need), but I really don't think it will be a very satisfying story. Your main objective in making decisions, including mistakes, on behalf of your character is to help everyone at the table make a story together." (If that's what the game is about.)<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"Stop stop stop.  If you do that, your guy will achieve their goals (or get what they need),. but it's not really the kind of game where you're an amoral torturer, you're a good-hearted space hero! Your main objective in this game is to portray a good-hearted space hero, you might be a bit rough around the edges, but in the end you and your friends have a heart of gold." (if that's what the game is about)<br/><br/>It's impossible to come up with a generic fix for the situation because the situation arises when the game's goals go one way and you go the other way.  You have to bring the player back to what <i>their job</i> in the game is. And that's not a generic "have fun", that's a specific thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333219/#Comment_333219" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T13:58:11+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  1:58PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, what Jason says!

I don't think I'm just pointing out fears, I heard it happen in my game, and wanted to look to other games to see how they fix it. <br/><br/>Chris, that may be how you play The Pool and IaWA, but I don't see nothin' in the actual rules texts about it. For example, The Pool:\n<blockquote><br/>You can describe your character\u2019s actions, the actions of those around him, and<br/>the outcome of those actions. You can even focus on less direct elements of the conflict<br/>such as what\u2019s happening in the next room or who\u2019s entering the scene.<br/>You can do just about anything. In fact, these are the only real limitations you must<br/>observe:<br/>1) Don\u2019t make alterations to the characters of other players (such as killing them).<br/>You can add complications for them and affect the things around them, but don\u2019t<br/>intrude on the creation of a fellow player.<br/>2) Keep your narration in synch with the established facts and tone of the game. If<br/>you need to ask the GM questions or prompt the other players for responses during<br/>your MOV, do so.<br/>3) Keep your narration reasonably short.<br/></blockquote>\nAnd I can't find the damn things now but I know Vincent Baker had IaWA conflict examples where the answerer could grab the brass ring even though they were at a disadvantage, and another where there was a big time jump within the conflict.<br/><br/>So this is what I'm on about - we vets sort of have a natural instinct for what we get to do in play. But put the game in front of a group of rookies--"I've played a little D&amp;D" "I've only ever played boardgames"--and who knows what will happen. A lot of you are assuming an experienced GM is present. In my playtest there was not. It was a blindtest. Because we should make games that rookies can play. Role-playing should be easy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>But, also, even in a game where narrating something game-breaking isn't against the rules (as it is in most of those examples):</blockquote>\nHey now. Only my <i> In a Wicked Age</i> example was against the rules (because it controls someone else's character, like Joel said.) <br/><br/>In the other games, I'm going to continue to believe my examples are legal (or could be easily interpreted as legal by a rookie:  In Misery Bubblegum the text says "what should happen next" - a rookie could totally interpret that to mean "we escape to a better life" is what should happen next)  unless you point me to the actual rules text that says they're not.<br/><br/>Which is fine - in all these games, there are fixes. "Try a different way"; GM adds conflicts and complications in MB &amp; The Pool &amp; WoM; Inspectres franchise dice. I see that now.  I'm just grumpy about the 'you're reading these rules wrong' posts, because AFAICT I'm not.

Blithely is a synonym for unconcerned.  So an unconcerned concern <br/>is making a big deal out of nothing.<br/><br/>I say rudimentary-- because it is a point which has been 'asked and answered' many times before. Example: back in his 2002 review of the The Pool, Ron Edwards noted that "The discussion of the Monologue of Victory seems driven by paranoia that the player will destroy any logic or content of a scenario."  (In American courtrooms, a witness's lawyer may declare "Objection-- asked and answered", when the opposing lawyer<br/>keeps asking the same question simply because she hopes to get a different answer than the one repeatedly given.)<br/><br/>36 posts into this thread, Jamie still did not appear to have adjusted his thesis to account for the body of contrary knowledge presented here-- not to mention the decade of actual play supporting that knowledge.<br/><br/>Is it really 'dumping' on Jamie-- after two days of unheeded replies-- when responses grow more pointed?<br/><br/>Does it really improve the discourse, for you to ride in like a white knight, making broad accusations of 'dumping' and 'pretending', and offering the straw man claim that "nobody" here has admitted they've experienced what Jamie describes?<br/><br/>The apparent disconnect between 'sides' in this discussion may not even exist.  It is a common aspect of internet discussion that such communication lacks small indications of assent-- the absence of a little nod or "un-huh" given while the other person is talking, which would have indicated "message received, point stipulated, common ground located".<br/><br/>Which is another reason that pointedness should not be taken as abusive, but as a legitimate attempt to prompt Jamie to give some indication of whether what's said is being heard at all.<br/><br/>The problem is analogous to how hearing impaired people are frequently perceived to be pushy or uncooperative when they prompt others to speak up or repeat themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333453/#Comment_333453" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T07:20:51+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  7:20AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2011 7:25AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>But, also, even in a game where narrating something game-breaking isn't against the rules (as it is in most of those examples):</blockquote>\nHey now.

It works much better."<br/><br/>For someone just learning the game from the text... man, those texts have got a long way to go before the learn to say what they need to say.<br/><br/>So, I agree with you. But it's a fine line.<br/><br/>For example, is this guy, playing old-school D&amp;D, breaking the rules?<br/><br/>Player: "I'm going to roll to Hide in Shadows and sneak behind the bad guy."<br/><br/>DM: "OK, roll."<br/><br/>Player: "Success!"<br/><br/>DM: "So you sneak behind him, creeping through the shadows... and a pineapple falls on your head. You stumble and everyone sees you!"<br/><br/>I don't think you'd find any text in the book which tells you "this is doing it wrong"... but I don't think the players at the table would agree that it's "by the book", either. You know what I mean?<br/><br/>Some of your examples are very similar. Are they against the rules or not? Hard to say, in a sense.<br/><br/><br/>...I'd like to hope that our games can go from "play this at home, then become a member of an online forum and have people berate you for playing it wrong until you Get It" to a better teaching model as time progresses.

For the record, I didn't know I was dumping on Jamie.<br/><br/>And, for the record, yes, I've seen this happen. Like I said, you fix it.<br/><br/>Finally, from <i>The Pool</i>'s rules, "Keep your narration in synch with the established facts..." For me, that's it. Was it established that the long lost father was out in the woods while you were having the fight in the Robber Baron's Manor? No? Then when one win's the fight with the Robber Baron, then one can't have a character go running out into the woods and find the father. If the established facts established no causality between the fight an the father, how could one possibly do that?<br/><br/>But, I know partly that's me bringing my understanding of things to the rules. I'm all about the fiction being built on top of what has come before. It's a discipline in my head. Just jumping into the woods to find a father would just seem wrong to me. How do we get that across in rules? We figure out how we want the players to apply the rules, and state this as clearly and as best we can. (I'm not saying this is easy all the time!)<br/><br/><br/>Years ago I'm studying art. And I do this thing with my pencil -- a kind of half-assed mark on the page with is neither a line nor a curve. And my teacher, standing next to me, points this out.<br/><br/>"Yeah," I say, "I keep doing that."<br/><br/>There's a beat. He says, "Then stop doing it."<br/><br/>That's all I'm trying to say. The fact that it sometimes happens doesn't change the fact that you clean it up.<br/><br/><br/>Also, I'm not buying the "newbie" concern at all. I've watched "experienced" players run overtly and out-of-control stakes just before the cards are dropped in a game of <i>Primetime Adventures</i>. It's the same thing. People lose sight of the conflict at hand and go all-crazy adding all sorts of shit that has nothing to do with what we're <i>building on</i> in the fiction. I saw the same thing happening in games of <i>In A Wicked Age...</i> It does happen!<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's not a concern. It is! The games don't work well this way! I'm saying the solution is <i>to not do it</i>. I'm saying the worry about it -- from what I've seen over the years -- is out of proportion to both the concept and the solution, which is pretty simple.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, if we're talking about writing the texts, then yes, this needs to be clear. <br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333468/#Comment_333468" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T08:34:01+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  8:34AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But to some degree - a degree that will probably vary hugely from game to game and person to person - this is an aesthetic judgment that needs to be made by the table, not a rule that can be written down.

Whether its introduction to role playing texts that amount to "its like playing cops and robbers", to ill thought out descriptions of play that created Impossible Things Before Breakfast, to squirrely IIEE problems, etc. etc. etc. there was a lot of stuff that just wasn't well explained, wasn't well designed for the particular game in question, and rested upon a couple of decades of "that's how its done".<br/><br/>Now indie games have been around long enough that we've developed our own traditions that result in stuff that's poorly explained, not well designed for the game in question, and rest upon a decade of "that's how its done".<br/><br/>The Pool is a great example of how this sort of thing happens.  The Pool isn't really a complete game.  I certainly got the sense that it wasn't even intended to be a complete game...its really just a brainstorm of a cool mechanic that could be turned into a game, but as written its a game scrap.  Yet that particular scrap just happened to hit a chord with Ron Edwards who heaped upon it copious praise that attracted the excited attentions of the Forge community thus resulting in that early game scrap being raised up as one of the stars in an early constellation of the "New Hotness".<br/><br/>As such it became a touch stone, a role model, an example that directly or indirectly helped set the standard early on for how to describe player narration rights.  After all if the Pool described it like X and Ron et.al. loved it, then describing it like X must  be good enough.  Unfortunately, because it was just a germ of a game idea it actually does a pretty horrendous job of describing how to play it and Ron's loving experiences of it were 1/3 the Pool and 2/3s Ron's own gameing traditions brought in to make it work.  The fact that the Pool was at one time one of the most cited "must read/play" games new designers were advised to check out just exasperated the issue.<br/><br/>Jaime's points in the OP are IMO our version of The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast.  Christopher's quite cognizant explanation for how to make such text actually work harkens back to JD Corley's impassioned attempts to redeem TITBB.  In both cases the text is ass.  Sure you can make the game work in spite of the text...just as JD repeatedly pointed out that no competant GM was ever unable to reconcile the contradictory instructions inherent in the Impossible Thing.  But just as a I thought that was a cop out bullshit answer then...so I have to say its a cop out bullshit answer now.<br/><br/>We've been sharing narration rights for over a decade now...we clearly have learned how to do it successfully...we should be holding ourselves to higher standards of explaining how to do it successfully.  Instead, the recent trend seems to be to write ever lighter and lighter rule sets targeted specifically at audiences who already know how to do it so the author doesn't actually have to bother to explain it.  A trend which I find exceedingly disappointing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333533/#Comment_333533" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T15:53:42+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  3:53PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's something there, Ralph, and you're not wrong. But I'm not sure you're right, either.<br/><br/>Explicit procedure only takes you so far. At some point, you've got to make the game your own and take responsibility for it.<br/><br/>The crappy thing about a lot of pre-Forge game design was that it was made up of a bunch of contradictory, mashed-together techniques, shibboleths, and rhetoric and a massive, massive set of assumptions about play culture and motivations. You could not make it work without doing what JD talks about - picking and choosing and customizing until you had something that suited you and your group. If you tried to follow the text, it would suck most of the time.<br/><br/>The big advancement that came from blowing up that paradigm was "put in only the rules that you need, that serve your game's purpose, AND NO MORE." Getting the cruft and the assumed culture-of-play out, and destroying the assumption that all RPGs were basically D&amp;D in drag, freed people to design and play in new ways without having to already be brilliant editors and adaptors of other people's crummy texts.<br/><br/>But the big bad thing that came from that was re-introducing our own forms of cruft, in the form of games that prescribed TOO MUCH. Narrow, delicate little things that would work right for just this one thing, and would blow up if you didn't want to do exactly that. Designs got increasingly baroque as they tried to take all the judgment calls and - when you get down to it - creativity out of play.<br/><br/>I think games like The Pool - incomplete, fragile, but not trying to be any more than that - are the most usefully eye-opening games for understanding where the next steps in building better games is. It's not in spelling everything out in some perfect text that will communicate to any - any! - potential player exactly how to get the same results that the designer intends. It's in creating the minimum necessary set of instructions that will enable a group with functional playing-together skills to get fun out of it.... and in isolating and teaching those playing-together skills as a thing that ANY game can benefit from.<br/><br/>I have no problem with the idea that a fair proportion of the games we are seeing now are "for experienced story-gamers" and assume that set of skills are at least basically present. What's missing is the organized effort to share those skills outside the confines of specific games, and a solid set of entry-level games that teach those skills in a way that is portable rather than intimately tied to the mechanics and structures of one game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333536/#Comment_333536" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T16:03:40+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  4:03PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to derail too much, but "competent GMing" (Ralph) and "customization" (Mark), as much as I love those two things, were not the only thing in those games that made the Impossible Thing Before Breakfast neither impossible nor a thing nor before breakfast, for a record in terms of jargon failure not matched since the Holy Roman Empire, or maybe "military intelligence".

I'm as shocked as you! Yes, it's short-handy and incomplete. Yes it's a ciphertext. But it still works for some people, even without the institutional knowledge. I didn't make it for them, and I would have done it VERY differently if I had. I made it for five specific people to play, once. And yet... here we are. It's my most-played game, and it's played by more brand-new players (even by people not lead by experienced gamers) than anything else I've done. I'm trying really hard to learn from this bizarre turn of events.<br/><br/>But anecdotes about how well or ill received AW or LB or The Pool are just amount to hogwash. We don't really know. If you want to say that our games could be made better, I'll enthusiastically agree. If you want to say there's a trend, or an epidemic, or a great mass of floundering lost-souls...

It's either a capture or an illegal move, not some weird thing that happens sometimes and no one knows what to do about it. What if we didn't have that explicit rule? Chess would be CRAZY too, and it would be a worse game for it.<br/><br/>Let's stop depending on the oral tradition to solve the problems of sloppy rules writing. If av MoV is stupid and boring if you don't follow the rule above, that rule should be in the text.</blockquote>\nOh, hell yes.<br/><br/>That said, it's not that easily done. The rules of Chess don't say anything about making horse-noises when moving the knight, or whether it's OK to leave one player alone with the board for a few minutes (would they take the opportunity to switch two pieces?), or how to decide when a player is taking too long to make their move without a clock.<br/><br/>A lot of people are trying, though, and I hope they keep trying.<br/><br/>Still, what John Harper is saying is interesting... and not all that surprising to me, though I can't quite explain why. Why do people play Lady Blackbird successfully but not, say, In a Wicked Age...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333552/#Comment_333552" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T17:27:47+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  5:27PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think its a new player vs. veteran player, outsider/insider thing actually.  Poison'd is a great example of a game text that works super well for a certain set of veteran players and abysmally for another set of veteran players.  Blackbird, as John notes, has enjoyed success even among new players.  <br/><br/>For me its more about not relying on serendipity to get great play.  Its great when the mind set / way of navigating personal creativity of a player or group just happens to meld flawlessly with what the designer had hoped for.  Its even pretty good (I would say not as good, but others would say better) when the mind set / personal creativity of the group manages to work flawlessly even in a different way than the designer had hoped for.  But I think its poor design to rely on that as the primary means for a game to work.  <br/><br/>I'm not talking about spelling everything out in some giant tome of tediousness the way Magic the Gathering FAQs go on ad infinitum on how certain cards interact.  I'm talking about setting the right expectations up front.  Expectations about authority over game elements, scale and scope of what can be said, a fundamental understanding of the jobs the player has in the game.  There's a world of difference between "your job as a player is to put yourself firmly in the shoes of your character and act to pursue your character's goals and objectives to the best of their ability" and "your job as a player is to put your character in crazy situations that make things messy and then enjoy the fun of picking up the pieces"<br/><br/>Good design should start by telling the player what their job is, and then making sure the mechanics of the game provide the right tools for doing that job effectively.  Weak design is forgetting to mention the first part.  Poor design is when the second part fails to facilitate the first part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333555/#Comment_333555" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T17:56:51+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  5:56PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2011 5:57PM by John_Harper.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Ralph!<br/><br/>Shreyas: Sorry if I sounded defensive.

It sounded like a classic case of wanting more thematic stories, but only having "to hit" combat mechanics as a tool.   She &amp; her boyfriend weren't shilling for story-centric mechanics.  They seemed unaware that any alternative even existed.<br/><br/>After the panel they spoke to Shreyas*, and he recommended some other systems.  I suggested Lady Blackbird, which Shreyas endorsed as well.<br/><br/>Their reply was, "We've already played Lady Blackbird.  Wow, yeah!

But the thing is "telling" is going to be very dependent on listening, and the right tools likewise on people willing and able to use them. Just build the damn games.

I'm an avid board gamer.  There is no unified and comprehensive audience for board games (Hell the Euro vs. Ameritrash debate can get more noisome than roll-playing vs. role-playing), yet board games are typically characterized by good instructions and clear texts (at least relative to RPGs).  <br/><br/>There are board games I enjoy, and games I don't.  There are games I respect the design of but never feel the need to play again, and games that I'd play nearly every day if opportunity arose.  There are games I react emotionally against because of a personal pet peeve, and there are games I can forgive a bunch of warts because it just hits a particular joy.  But there are rarely any board games that I can't discern after a modicum of effort the clear, concise, and correct way to play.  And when I do find such a game I don't hesitate to label it as having piss poor rules text...or often times (as with say Neuland) a piss poor translation.<br/><br/>Granted there are orders of magnitude more options available to a player in any moment of an RPG than there is in even the most complex board games, but most of those fall into a fairly reasonable number of categories.  There is nothing inherent in the unique properties of a role playing game that prohibit writing rules clearly save IMO a damaging and misguided tradition that such isn't necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333573/#Comment_333573" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T21:45:28+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  9:45PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Why do people play Lady Blackbird successfully but not, say, In a Wicked Age...?</blockquote>\nLady Blackbird shoots right to play.

In Lady Blackbird, you don't start with character creation. That distinguishes it from about 95% of the other RPGs out there. (I think MouseGuard is another notable exception.) When the first question that a new player gets is "who do you want to be?", that can shut things down in a hurry. When the first question is "what do you do RIGHT NOW?" things get moving quickly.<br/><br/>Sure, you can run any game with pregen characters, but with many story games the character creation can be a lot of fun, so you naturally don't want to deprive the new players of that. But maybe think about putting that off until the second game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333584/#Comment_333584" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-08T07:49:28+00:00" title="July  8, 2011  7:49AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DaveC</cite><br/>There are probably a hundred good answers to this, but I think there's one that's really obvious.

And then I see some people roll gutter balls and say, "Bowling's not for me." But I know if they could just get past rolling gutter balls they'd see why I dig it so much.

I was trying to ask, "Which of these games could work for utter newbies, and why?  What do these games have that That's Drama doesn't? In particular, what stops them from doing X?" And to rehash the answers:<br/><br/>Misery Bubblegum:  Might work with newbies, because even if an utter newbie says "We escape to a better life" the GM and other players can still get in their dish after (unless everyone's out of cards, in which case, happy ending) <br/><br/>Inspectres: This is probably the most newbie friendly - the franchise dice make it impossible to narrate anything other than a temporary, fleeting victory.<br/><br/>Wilderness of Mirrors: I'd guess this is the least likely to work, because though a GM could still screw you up after you narrate your way past all your dangers, some newbie GM's might think, "Huh, I guess they win"<br/><br/>The Pool: About the same as WoM - if a newbie player narrates 'my father's killer walks in and I slay him' (assuming it fits the fiction, as CK pointed out) the newbie GM could strike back with all manner of complications, but would they?<br/><br/>In a Wicked Age: Could work for newbies because you can't narrate other people's characters actions. <br/><br/>Archipelago: Could work because other players will 'try a different way' and 'that might not be so easy' on you (hopefully)<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and sorry if anyone felt I was attacking their favorite game, I really like most of the games I listed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333604/#Comment_333604" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-08T11:08:55+00:00" title="July  8, 2011 11:08AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Honestly, didn't have some point I was trying to make</blockquote>\nYou have won my empathy.

I've never had a good experience with it and don't concider it nearly the beacon of goodness that he does.<br/><br/>But it does kind of confirm that the Pool was not a full game but just a scrap...after all if Ron has to write 13 pages of "best practices" just to explain how to play the Pool effectively...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333651/#Comment_333651" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-08T20:16:18+00:00" title="July  8, 2011  8:16PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I feel like I'm ready to play the Pool now, having read the "guide"!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333788/#Comment_333788" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T18:04:52+00:00" title="July 10, 2011  6:04PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DaveC</cite><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>&gt; Still, what John Harper is saying is interesting... and not all that surprising to me, though I can't quite explain why. Why do people play Lady Blackbird successfully but not, say, In a Wicked Age...?<br/><br/>(no harm done, John - I thought you were probably kidding around, but, Internet:)<br/><br/>I think this is a SERIOUSLY FERTILE QUESTION and everyone who cares about making games that are cool should think damn hard about it. Except take out IAWA and just focus on *what makes LB work?*</blockquote>\nThere are probably a hundred good answers to this, but I think there's one that's really obvious. In Lady Blackbird, you don't start with character creation. That distinguishes it from about 95% of the other RPGs out there. (I think MouseGuard is another notable exception.) When the first question that a new player gets is "who do you want to be?", that can shut things down in a hurry. When the first question is "what do you do RIGHT NOW?" things get moving quickly.<br/><br/>Sure, you can run any game with pregen characters, but with many story games the character creation can be a lot of fun, so you naturally don't want to deprive the new players of that. But maybe think about putting that off until the second game.<br/><br/>Moreover, many Story-Game-crowd favorites simply won't work in some important way without chargen.  All three of Vincent's big games strike me this way.  Sorcerer, Polaris, 1,001 Nights, and Steal Away Jordan, just to name a few off the top of my head, also have this issue.<br/><br/>In other games, you can have sort of modular pregen\u2014you mention Mouse Guard, and one of the things I like about that is the players can change the Belief and Instinct even when using the pregens.  I've experimented with such modularity in both Burning Wheel and Riddle of Steel one-shots to great effect\u2014I can handle all the number-crunching beforehand, and the players get to do the important bits (or BITs) at the table.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333803/#Comment_333803" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T22:30:18+00:00" title="July 10, 2011 10:30PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, to throw in my two cents:<br/><br/>LB is a surprisingly well-written game for a one-shot. The rules are simple and clear. They are repeated on each of the character sheets, so they are easy to find. John didn't waste any energy on trying to make the rules 'clever" They are very close to being "intuitive." He supplied just enough to drop you into the story and get you on your way.<br/><br/>The setting is a credible pastiche of a number of sci-fi/fantasy elements that fit well together. The pre-gen characters are fun and it is clear that this is THEIR story. It appeals to the geek mind at a very primal level.<br/><br/>IAWA is a game that I dearly love. Just ask Ralph or Seth. However, I'm not sure that I would have fell so much in love with it if I had merely read the rules from the book and didn't have their guiding hands while playing it. The rules read as though they where written by the "Old Spice Guy".. a quick pace, and just to the left of reality. If you don't have some help understanding them, its very possible to get lost and lose interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333824/#Comment_333824" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T06:37:11+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  6:37AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Inspectres - you're investigating something - but instead of giving yourself a small clue with your narration rights, you say "...and then the evil mastermind comes out and says, 'You have gotten too close to discovering my evil plan!' but he slips on a banana peel and we capture him."</blockquote>\nThat's not possible by the rules, either, unless the franchise dice for the plot have already been collected.
