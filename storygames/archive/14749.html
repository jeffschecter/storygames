I posted this in Forge earlier and tried to find some players, but as I'm having obvious troubles finding anyone interested, I'll refine the idea a bit and just dump it here. I want to test this out one day, but for now I'm happy just to put it up for storage and possible discussion, until I bump into 3-4 roleplaying nietzsche-fans.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I read Nietzsche and Sorcerer at the same time and realized, that Nietzsche's ideas of overman could be easily used as Sorcerer's humanity. What I'm suggesting is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nHumanity: Will to life.<br/>\nHumanity is gained when affirming will to life: creating stuff, defining your own values and morals for yourself, overcoming obstacles by being awesome, loving yourself and everything else, because the world is as it should be. Enduring pain and setbacks because of their pedagogical value and asking for more. Forcing your will on the world around you.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of humanity gain rolls: <br/>\n* PC decides to publicly oppose the standing moral order and accepts that he will be viewed as a eccentric at best, crazy and dangerous at worst.<br/>\n* PC follows up with a plan that is guaranteed to put himself and tons of other people through hell, because he damn well wants the result so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nHumanity is lost when will to life is diminished: subjugating under someone else, following someone else's rules, leaving stuff undone or coddling and not challenging yourself or others. Concentrating on metaphysical or spiritual stuff on expense of the real world. <br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of humanity loss rolls: <br/>\n* PC decides that having fun is sinful and stops to make sure he gets a nicer after-life.<br/>\n* PC takes orders from clearly inferior authority because of tradition or fear of the consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormal god-fearing duty-driven guy would have humanity of 2-3. Strong willful anarchist would be maybe 5, supposing he likes his life a ton. Humanity 10 or something would represent total \xdcbermensch: a practically demigod, rejoicing in his existence, creating and destroying in equal measure. Humanity 0 would mean total apathy or complete loss of ego. A character would turn into a bitter puppet, without even enough energy to die.<br/>\n<br/>\nDemons are: the impossible proof that this world is not enough. God is dead and the natural world is all there is, but somehow there's still these supernatural creatures running around. Humanity is paramount, except demons are gnawing at the very core of that idea. If you summon demons, you blatantly announce that you are not good enough and the world is not enough. How could you be such a magnificent bastard, if you decide to rely on stuff like demons? Summoning a demon is like Bruce Lee taking a pepper-spray to a fist fight. You need tons of willpower, effort and gall to summon demons, but doing stuff the hard way is always even harder. Summoning demons is cheating by default, accepting that you are not gloriously human enough to do it the proper way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDemons are like: timid, conniving, subtle, backstabbing, fear-mongering, doubt-casting bastards. Nothing grandiose. Humans are great, demons are sad, little and dangerous as hell.<br/>\nDemons look like: hunchbacks, cripples, toads, spiders, oozy-swampy-things, colourless murky things, bleak and dull. Mostly lifted from the metaphores that Nietzshce uses in Also sprach Zarathustra to describe weak and dangerous stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcerers: Player characters are pure overman-material. Independent, strong, willful, etc. (Come on, look at the stats!) Still for some reason they summon demons and diminish everything they could be and could become. What is so important to these guys that they risk their greatness by summoning demons to get it? How and why are these people so broken, that they jeopardize the world by bringing stuff into it, that shouldn't have any reason being here? One of the interesting points of the game would be to see if the character (and players) decide to go for high nietzschean-humanity, settle for mechanically lower humanity by becoming caring and sociable guys, or do they ignore both and just get sucked in to demon summoning and humanity zero.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be perfectly ok for a player to decide that this character strives to be a nice and mellow ordinary-joe, even though he's obviously cut out to be something greater. Think Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven as a sort of example. Other character could fully embrace his fate as an overman and strive for high humanity... and still be forced to summon a demon. Could he redeem himself as a human, or will the demon just drag him down?<br/>\n<br/>\nConcrete setting could be anything after 1900s or so. Up to the group really. I'm not yet completely sure what kind of stories I would go for with this kind of setting, but luckily that's really not my problem, is it? If I'd get bunch of really cool PCs on the table and their NPCs and kickers, stuff should propably start to happen pretty naturally. The setting would be REAL WORLD, not the fantastical mystical world of Also sprach Zarathustra for example. There's no Zarathustra going around shooting lightning bolts and flying all over the place, there's just the real world, but where Nietzsche's writing are true, at least for the player characters and other extraordinary individuals.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335459/#Comment_335459" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T01:16:50+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  1:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a couple of comments/questions. (Note, I tried read Nietzsche years ago, but found the writing impenetrable, so I'm kind of talking out of my arse...)<br/><br/>What exactly does Lore represent? Lore is not the opposite of Humanity, though it should push against it. What would a Sorcerer with high Humanity and high Lore be like?<br/><br/>I think you should put more thought into the setting. If you can cook the basic conflict of your Humanity into the setting, then it makes it much easier to focus on that in the game. Maybe you could set it somewhere where the government is also the Church, making it hard for characters to express their Humanity. Or you could put all the characters in the Military, an organisation that seems to both promote and quash the Nietzschian ideal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jaakko%20Koivula" title="Jaakko Koivula"><img alt="Jaakko Koivula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.saunalahti.fi/keizzah/avatar.bmp"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jaakko%20Koivula">Jaakko Koivula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335531/#Comment_335531" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T12:32:10+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 12:32PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to think about Lore at all! Good point.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first idea of Lore would be some sort of lovecraftian secrets. Knowledge about things completely alien to Earth, our universe and world in general. They could be pure hogwash to most persons, but if the right guy with enough willpower comes along, he could use it to make stuff happen. I'm thinking Lore could be pretty personal. Something that you use as a catalyst to rip open the natural world and drag something unnatural into it. Dadaistic art, bacchanal-rituals, cthulhu mythos, oriental mysterier, even Bible could be used to throw enough spiritual weight around for a sorcerer to latch on to something from somewhere. Lore could be defined as a bag of mind altering tricks and stuff that distances you from the natural world. There's tons of weird shit out there, but with Lore you actually know which is usable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself see the setting as just normal world, propably around 1900-1940 or so. Characters could have religious or military connections or history, but I would hesitate making every PC an officer in the bavarian army or something. I'm thinking that the concrete setting etc. are stuff, that is better to cook up with the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
