I'd like to think that nowadays I can recognize and communicate this sort of expectation within the group, but who knows. In any case, I've tried to be a good sport about inventing detail on the spot, but that may of course work more or less spectacularly. Nowadays perhaps better than historically - seems like I get more ideas as I grow older, and thus have no trouble inventing a dungeon or whatever on the spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268411/#Comment_268411" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T19:12:18+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  7:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>"Basically the whole game is just you being a jackass and trying to kill us and then we get experience points when you FAIL.

It's one thing that bugs me about Universalis; there's no real character ownership there.  Of course, I also deeply love Universalis, which you can see from a lot of my comments on SG.  Which is why I'm trying to make a variant of it (well, of Blood Read Sands) that's more role-playing-y.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268459/#Comment_268459" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T01:53:34+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  1:53AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the experience is probably more related to "goofing off and having a good time drinking beers" than necessarily any deep roleplaying.

The players say "I want to do X" and I say "okay, roll Y" and we move on.  I think if any of them were required to learn any of the rules for themselves, they probably wouldn't be as easy to engage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
