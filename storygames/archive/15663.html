The skivvy was:\n<blockquote>A campaign set in a mystical version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun_era" rel="nofollow">Kofun-era Japan</a>. The players are a group of rational and well educated Chinese diplomats who are trying to find the Queen of Yamato's court, in an archipelago full of mountains, forests, barbaric tribesmen, dragons, oni, tengu and river ghosts. </blockquote>\nThat's literally all I wrote at the time, and that was about three years ago, but it strikes me in retrospect as a really cool idea. The basic concept, I think, you can probably get from the above description, but to further elaborate: a group of Chinese diplomats are visiting the Japanese archipelago in search of somebody or something called the Queen of Yamato. Except it's not the Japanese archipelago of the real world: it's the Japanese archipelago of legend - a misty, forested land of strange spirits and mysterious places, where nothing is as it seems and the people are alien and cold. <br/><br/>So tell me: what system is screaming to you, "use me for this"?

Unfortunately, I can't think of anything offhand that would really work right out of the box.<br/><br/>My first thought is that it might make an interesting setting hack for Call of Cthulhu, or your favorite Gumshoe variant.  I want to say Burning Wheel might also be an interesting choice-- obviously Blossoms would not be directly applicable (nor most of the elf-dwarf-orc stuff in the main book, frankly), but a lot of the Shinto &amp; shamanic magics in there would be very useful (mostly for the GM), as would a lot of the stuff in the Magic Burner, and the Great Wolf stuff in Monster Burner if you wanted to go a little more Princess Mononoke.<br/><br/>If you wanted to focus more on the "exploring a mysterious land" thing, especially in a less traditional way, I want to say the basic setup and themes of Apocalypse World might be good, but you'd have to do Playbooks and such from scratch because I don't think any of the basic ones would be a good fit, nor am I aware of any AW hacks that would be any better.  The recent Houses of the Blooded thread reminds me how great that game's basic "dueling narration rights" is for gradually revealing the details of a largely unknown setting, but again, you'd have to do a lot of work beating it into shape since pretty much everything else in the game is at odds with our premise.<br/><br/>Finally, if we wanted to go totally fantastical and have this be Chinese Ghost Story Meets Princess Mononoke, Legends of the Wulin would be great (especially since kung-fu diplomats are one of the default character archetypes), but again would require some heavy rewrites because of the way that game ties setting into character creation.<br/><br/>But overall, this strikes me as a very cool premise that could be mined for weird fantasy or horror.  I could totally sink my teeth into this, but then I do have some interest in Chinese and Japanese history and especially fantasy flicks from those two countries, so this is kind of hitting me where I live.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355158/#Comment_355158" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T14:53:04+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  2:53PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the mix of weird fantasy and horror is where I'd go with it.

Player and GM gather their dice pools, set aside dice to handicap themselves ("wagers"), then highest roller gets to establish a fact about the thing or situation in question, and a number of other facts equal to the number of dice wagered.  Anyone else who still managed to beat the target number of 10 gets facts equal to half their wagers.  Obviously the group needs to all be on the same page regarding what facts are appropriate for the setting (and the GM better be pretty good at incorporating things on the fly), but my group had pretty amazing results when we played Houses.  Of course, it depends on whether you want the setting to be mysterious to the players, or to the whole table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355221/#Comment_355221" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T00:08:00+00:00" title="January 21, 2012 12:08AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's the same as B&amp;H, give or take.

I've had really good times playing it, but only as a one-shot, I'm not sure how well it holds up for extended play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355260/#Comment_355260" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T10:33:39+00:00" title="January 21, 2012 10:33AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I would love to play that campaign!
