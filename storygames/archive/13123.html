First session after chargen for my first Burning Wheel game. We're all playing noble sons of various types, following our childhood friend (Prince Lucius) to reestablish ties with the city that was once the capitol of the Empire. Times are bad: the current capitol is a humid sty, the NEW capitol was sacked by orcs before the crown could even be moved there, so Luc decided to go 'reclaim' the old capitol and renew the Empire with hope.<br/><br/>I'm playing his old friend, a third-son of nobility who joined the church and was kind of assigned to be the Church's presence on this foolish endeavor. (Reward or punishment: you decide.)<br/><br/>We basically failed every single roll for the entire night. (Except for the first Conspicuous test of the night.)<br/><br/>And it was excellent. <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?9967-[BW]-Sunday-Skype-Rebuilding-the-Empire-(1)" rel="nofollow">I wrote it up here</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295898/#Comment_295898" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T06:11:15+00:00" title="October  5, 2010  6:11AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Saturday, there was the finale of the Ring of Changes campaign.<br/><br/>The Wing Commander got court martialed and busted down to Squadron Leader, the engineer had her parents kidnapped, but screw their personal concerns, they want to take down the big bad. The alchemists research a ritual to undo his transformation into the perfect alloy- and etch the circle they need onto the underside of the armoured deck of the Squadron Leader's dirigible.<br/><br/>A daring night flight into a hostile country takes them to the smallholding where the big bad lurks. The Squadron Leader has to manoeuvre her balloon dangerously close to the building to keep the big bad in the centre of it, while he sends lances of indestructible metal through the vessel, injuring those on board and smashing it up real good. At the same time, two brain-washed assassins are attacking the alchemist who rang the doorbell.<br/><br/>The big reveal: the stone alchemist lost his memory creating the assassins for the big bad. How does he respond? By risking his sanity and memory to undo the procedure and give them their lives and memories back. He just makes the roll.<br/><br/>The dirigible stays up just long enough for the glass alchemist to complete the ritual, but the big bad explodes into metal pellets, bringing down the dirigible in flames.  He rises from the conflagration, a fleshy mockery of life, only to be put down by the combined efforts of the alchemists.<br/><br/>Epilogue- everybody's lives are screwed, but at least they stopped the bad guy. The Stone alchemist loses his memory again, the glass alchemist joins the Hermetic Order, the Squadron Leader is drummed out of the air force and the engineer becomes even more estranged from her family.<br/><br/>(This session also created the Ransom Note Protocol, a means of breaking into any location. Take a faked ransom note and an elephant gun with a bow tied around it. The ransom note is for if the police try to stop you. The bow is so you can claim you were just trying to give the resident a present if you're challenged once inside. The elephant gun is for if that doesn't work.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295952/#Comment_295952" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T11:59:57+00:00" title="October  5, 2010 11:59AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Friday night I finally MC'd my first game of Apocalypse World for my brother-in-law, cousin and nephew. They played a Brainer (Redcloud), Driver (Frankie) and Hardholder (Colonel).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe get toward the end of the session (kind of a one-shot, so some fronts actually kicked in). This guy named III and his crew (warlord: dictator) had moved in on Colonel's gasoline/water supplies and was increasingly getting brazen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the basic scene is, it's early morning after a night without lights (the generators ran out) and an attack on the compound by some mountain men (grotesques: cannibals) whom they easily fought off, but the population was shaken up a bit. So, standing around this kind of pile of ash and embers where a large bonfire burned throughout the night, they get into an argument about whether Colonel should be helping Redcloud rescue these women and children that had been kidnapped from a ruined town down in the valley (we set our location in the foothills/mountains of the Appalachians). Colonel isn't too hip on rescuing the people, considering he's got his own peeps to look after. Redcloud decides to hone in on Colonel to see what it would take for him to help (read a person), only he fails the roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as MC I'm thinking, "Hmmm... what hard move could I make here..." I was kind of at a loss, so I skimmed my moves and decided to make a front move. I chose "Offer to negotiate".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, interrupting their conversation, all of a sudden heavy, thick gunfire fills the air. It's coming from off-screen somewhere near the gates to the compound (announce off-screen badness). They decide to go check it out and it turns out it's a couple of III's men in a run down WWII Jeep (the kind where the front windshield folds down) and its got a gatling gun attached to the back. Strapped to the front of the Jeep is Jackson and Marsh, two guys that were supposed to be guarding the mine entrance that led to the underground river (established by "asking provocative questions and building on the answers..." ). Marsh has got a bullet in his head.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of III's men stands up on the Jeep and explains that Jackson will be the next to have a bullet in his head unless they quit wasting his time. He demands to negotiate a deal with Colonel. He tells Colonel that III wants ten women from the compound delivered and in exchange he'll supply the compound with a month's worth of gas and water (make them buy). He expects an answer shortly and to meet down the mountain at a bridge to make the exchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the next 20 minutes in real world time, I sit back in watch in awe as they all try to justify the trade, which women should be selected (old? ugly? single? diseased? etc... etc...). Not once do they consider hopping in Frankie's big 4x4 and going out guns blazing. Nope. I'm stunned to watch them consider sacrificing these humans for the good of the whole (it was like watching Blindness...). They round up 10 women (using a couple Go Aggro moves) and throw them, flailing and screaming and crying and crawling, in the back of the 4x4.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, they're worried about a big ambush. So they ready up some weapons and head down to the bridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. No ambush. They scan the area (read a sitch) and all looks well. That gatling gun is obviously a big problem, but it doesn't seem like it's going to be used if the deal goes down smoothly. Several barrels of gasoline and water later, the PCs hand over the women and the two groups cautiously go back to their lives. Done deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was kind of astonishing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the ride home, I asked my cousin (who played Frankie) about the whole scene. He said he wasn't sure why they didn't try some other option besides trading the women away and in hindsight, it seems like something that should have been considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, they didn't. Instead, they turned a hard choice into a seemingly simple one by justifying it and it let them survive. For the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295955/#Comment_295955" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T12:23:02+00:00" title="October  5, 2010 12:23PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not as bad as turning over 10 women to hostiles, but:<br><br>A week or so ago I was playing a Maestro D' in Apocalypse World, and Trevis described all these people lining up outside my establishment, looking for shelter from a coming toxic whiteout.

They roll up an Arko and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTbrIo1p-So" rel="nofollow">Helter Skelter</a>. The both are scrawny and since Arkos don't care much for the destructive force within Helter Skelters their buddy score starts as -3. Being scrawny the Arko is burdened by his big bag of excavation tools. They ponder wether they should spend their piss poor budget on food or smokes but I advice them food since going hungry is a penalty.<br><br>They treck through the jungle to get to the well known overgrown school dungeon. Since both want to navigate I give them a cooperation bonus (-3) and they succeed although with the worst possible success and I rule they miss a crevice which they fall down (both failed MOVE checks to avoid injury) and the Arkos leg is crippled (eerily since that player recently had his patella disjointed). <br/><br/>They explore at a moderate pace and stumble upon two resident gorillas. The Helter Skelter zaps one with chain lightning and the Arko takes a shot at the other one with his elephant gun but misses and hits the Helter Skelter who dies in an explosion of blood (their boss explicitly told them he would get pissed if they happened to kill each other in the dungeon). The Arko explores some more not happy about their loot this far. He gets mauled by some other monkeys but managed to snatch a machete from a corpse a finish them off before stumbling into a sawblade trap that ends him.<br/><br/>It went surprisingly smooth despite all three of us being new to the rules and dungeon crawling.

The session had started off with us rescuing a little girl from a vampire, who managed to stab our wizard with a bit of rebar.

Commotion from the garden below interrupted the story. Aparently a man with no hands tried to steal fruit from the Sultan's garden...<br/><br/>The second story was a story of betrayal and followed two friends who climbed a mountain in the lands north of the Sultan's. There, two friends met their doom while lusting after the riches in the city of gold.....<br/><br/>The third and last story told how two young suitors both wanted to marry the most beautiful girl in the city. Even her father only called her the Emerald, so precious was she. As is proper, the poor young man (his heart burning with true love) was cast aside for the noble young man (his purse brimming with gold).<br/><br/>Over all, probably one of my top three sessions of 1001 Nights!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297115/#Comment_297115" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-16T23:55:34+00:00" title="October 16, 2010 11:55PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a Tenderpaw in a game of Mouse Guard at the final EndGame Oakland <a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com/minicon/" rel="nofollow">minicon</a> of the year.<br/><br/>His Belief was something about not letting justice wait.

Within the first 5 minutes, we learn that BBQ is so named because he's fond of burning people alive and feeding them to his gang of savage fucking hyenas (who are nevertheless well disciplined). Since it was a one shot in about 4 hours, we all played at a faster, dirtier pace than we might have, and set into motion conflicts between factions, crazy cults, and an attempt to build a super weapon to kill the neighboring hardholder to whom BBQ owes tribute. Spector got in a big fight against some scavengers, and was knocked unconscious, but used his successful bonefeel roll to show up back in the hold with all the gear he was bringing back from his shop. BBQ went aggro on one of his lieutenants by leaning in for a hug and biting off his ear and eating it.

A big chunk of the session was dedicated to a grinding battle against a troll king and his brigands. So we start talking about what to do.<br/><br/>Then, while we are waiting for pizza, I break out Danger Patrol. Within fifteen minutes, and between pizza slices we have <br/>*the Ghost Professor, Dr. Hope, an ex-stygian who redeemed for his ways and is now trying to give a brighter future to humanity!<br/>*Billy Svenson, the Psychic Daredevil, who had inherited his powers from his alien father and his good looks from his swedish mother. In his spare time he's a student at Rocket City Junior High and is torn between his legacy of crimefighting and his sweetheart Peggy Jupiter!<br/>*Meg Red, the Atomic Warrior who has been going through the trauma of having been cheated on by her fianc\xe9e!<br/>and <br/>*Jack Piston, the Two-Fisted Commando, who fought off the zombie invasion of the evil scientist apparently going by the name Ted!<br/><br/>The nefarious Dr. Chimpanzetti has apparently released the crimson apes upon the unsuspecting city.

NEXT TIME, ON DANGER PATROL!<br/><br/>Some really really awesome scenes, clues, ideas and reincorporation by the players during the "previously on" montage, the interlude and the suspense scene. But it's late and I'm tired. I might also be getting some of those names wrong.<br/><br/>The only thing that's giving me trouble in DP is making up new threats and escalating existing ones, especially in suspense scenes. But it's a skill that needs to be trained. Otherwise the game really delivers on the promise of pulp action, as long as everyone is on the same page regarding the tone or appropriately genre-savvy (one suggested that he has a gun that shoots katanas...so we had to recalibrate on what exactly "pulp" means).<br/><br/>I didn't get to make quite as many "KA POW!" and "PEW PEW PEW" noises as I expected, and I didn't narrate as many punchy scene cuts and camera angles or witty dialogue. That would require higher energy levels, actual prep and better familiarity with the rules all around the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298099/#Comment_298099" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-23T17:46:28+00:00" title="October 23, 2010  5:46PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DFRPG.

Sold out by our mentor to the Los Angeles Red Court, who have their narcotic saliva infected gangbangers out hunting us, framed by the local warden for murdering council wizards. We were just returning from the Nevernever where I traded three favors with a lady of the Winter Court in return for our friend's freedom, and the Red Court infected are their waiting for us. They open up with AKs and Morgan blinds them but goes down due to a GM compel (Morgan had a moderate consequence from using too much magic in a previous battle). I open up a sink hole on Sunset Blvd to stop their car. but can't control it and the sink hole is growing. <br/><br/>We run for our car, but Morgan has an aspect about sacrificing for the art and takes Colin's compel to stay and try to counterspell my sink whole, so I try to hold off the leader of the gang, Supe, with a spirit shield. He rips through my shield like a knife through butter and throws a car door into me with superhuman strength, giving me the moderate consequence "everything hurts." Morgan gets the sink hole stopped, but has to take a consequence. "Exposed psyche." <br/><br/>We run for the car and I barely make it by tagging the Blinded aspect that Morgan had placed on the scene, when Supe tags my "Everything hurts" and grabs me. We're both out of magic, with only a couple of consequences left a piece. It looks like I'm about to be Taken Out, when I reach into my pocket and pull out the handkerchief given to me three sessions ago by a lady of the Summer Court with a promise that she would be there if I called. I press my lips to the imprint of her lipstick left on the handkerchief and see her riding toward me up Sunset Blvd. astride what looks at first to be a charging destrier but resolves into a big italian mortorcycle.

They see surreal spiritual anomalies hitning at issues that might be causing problems in the local area. I keep throwing stranger and stranger hooks at them until they decide to follow one as an interesting lead. A nomadic merchant drives an old ute ("pick-up truck" to you Americans) pulled by horses. He simply vanishes without a trace as he passes an ancient overgrown sign. Clearing the sign reveals heavy graffiti generally reading "Welcome to the Thousand Pits of Hell". <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Act 2: Uncovering the Problem</span><br/>The characters meet a strange assortment of people who have had their lives turned upside down by spiritual turmoil. I try to throw a range of hooks at the characters that play to their various strengths, and over the course of play they pick up a variety of traits that will help them as they prepare to confront the core issue causing the problems around them. They still don't know what that core issue might be, or who is behind it (whether spirit or mortal). It is uncovered that the characters are in Canberra, Australia's former capital; a city that in current times is rumoured to have been built 90% underground (so we play with that as a fact).<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Act 3: Delving Underground</span><br/>The characters prepare to enter the spirit world together for the first time, they sit is a circle and state what they wish to achieve in the world of the spirits. They ask their companions to draw trait symbols on their skins (pencilling this onto one another's character sheets). In the spirit world they meet other mortals who have become caught up in the dreaming as well as a Chinese spirit of the celestial bureaucracy, a protector of the old Chinese embassy in Canberra. They also encounter a spiritual barrier around Parliament House.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Act 4: Facing the Wrath of the Locals</span><br/>The characters return to the waking world with some rescued mortals from the dreaming. Things have only gotten worse during their foray into the spirit world. The characters try to work out what is going on based on the clues that have been presented so far. They believe that there must be something dangerous in the old Parliament house, possibly causing a spiritual maelstrom that is leaking into the waking world. They have met an old deranged army general who still relives his past at the National War Memorial, he offers to drive one of the old tanks to launch mortars at the old seat of government power. I make things really easy for them at this point, saving my tokens instead for a massive explosion to wipe out all the characters in a nuclear explosion. Luckily, a couple of the players notice that everything is running too smoothly.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Act 5: Blowing Up Parliament House</span><br/>The characters sabotage the tank and kill the deranged old general, it has been him causing the problems all along...the spiritual maelstrom was actually the ghosts of the past protecting the site and preventing the general from getting a lock on it.<br/><br/>All in all, this playtest session went reasonably well. I can't be certain whether this was a result of the system or simply the fact that the players involved were accustomed to my style of storytelling. I'll probably be writing up elements of this session as play examples for the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298265/#Comment_298265" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-26T04:41:02+00:00" title="October 26, 2010  4:41AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a Dresden game, we pondered tripping a set of magical detection wards by putting the evocation effect "MAGIC!" on a squirrel and tossing it across the barrier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298267/#Comment_298267" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-26T05:46:29+00:00" title="October 26, 2010  5:46AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In New World, my character, the Prophet Karim who had lead everyone across the sea on a promise of a City of Gold, died of a heart attack although many thought the Princess Jamuna was to blame and this reflected so badly on her authority that she was killed in an uprising.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298566/#Comment_298566" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T00:42:10+00:00" title="October 28, 2010 12:42AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Owl Hoot Trail, whilst dealing with cursed gold and tracking down the evil shaman, The Man in Black, Dwight R Clinton (Deputy), managed to blow himself up twice with dynamite and once when his shiny new dragon rifle misfired.

I'm bored with the grown-ups, as usual, so I go take care of my niece and nephew (twins, 7) and my father's niece's son (6, I think). They're jumping up and down the living room, wrecking everything.<br/><br/>"Let's play knights!" says the girl when she sees me. Her idea of knights is obviously kinda rocking on the sofa as if it were a horse.<br/>"Knights? You're on!"<br/>Within moments I'm spinning a tale of their adventure to the dragon's lair where the foul beast lies on a pile of treasure. They sneak around the couch, and when they make too much noise I stop snoring and ask in a booming voice who dares enter my realm. They hide under the table and I fall back asleep. They steal my golden coins, my crowns, necklaces, rings, cups, scepters and ride away on their horses. I wake up, find the treasure gone and chase them around the table. They hide under the table several more times, but when I dare them, saying they're cowards they crawl out and fight me. <br/><br/>So <i>obviously</i> I have them duel the dragon with Rock, Paper, Scissors. You have to defeat me three times, I say, because I am big and strong. They win the first exchange. Then the little bastards pull out moves like "Water Well" and "Vulcano" on me (basically like Lizard and Spock, but broken). Goddamn munchins. They get away with the treasure and build a new castle with the gold. We draw the castle. Then they said there was another dragon in America and we had to fight him. We boarded a ship and sailed there and shot some cowboys. We had to wrap up then.<br/><br/>Oh and the girl was a knight with a spear who also cooked lunch and dinner (her special ability, don't ask me, that's what she said). One of the boys had "a long white beard and and a cloak and...a staff...and light comes out of it!" "Gandalf?" I ask? "Yes, from Lo...lord of the..." "Rings" I help him. "Yeah!". Except later it turns out he's also half-cowboy and has a machine gun. The girl's brother was just kinda going along with it, he's really shy and didn't want to answer any of my questions, not even what class was he. I worry about him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
