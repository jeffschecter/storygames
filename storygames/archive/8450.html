For example, given how soap-opera-ish Star Trek often was, might a system with mechanics for relationships work? Assuming you wanted to reproduce the television show, a system friendly to splats (species, department) might be in order. If you simply wanted to run around the setting, something more freeform might be better suited. Ars Magica-esque troupe-style play might be a good idea, so that you could play each other's supporting cast (ie. redshirts, side characters) and thus reproduce the feel of the series, where not every main character had a big part in every episode, without forcing <i>players</i> to sit out.<br/><br/>That's all my thoughts so far, but I'll stay tuned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186934/#Comment_186934" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T15:19:40+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  3:19PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is true.

As it stands, it is a game that could only have been created to model TV in the last 10 years, since TV has changed a great deal in the last ten years.

However, DS9 was so big, I'd almost suggest just ditching the crew idea and playing "the most interesting people on the station," while making everyone else as NPCs. Voyager would, likewise, work well with something Arsish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186964/#Comment_186964" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T16:13:27+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  4:13PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm seeing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fragmad" title="fragmad"><img alt="fragmad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fragmad">fragmad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186970/#Comment_186970" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T16:26:02+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  4:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Maedhros</cite>Someone here once posted on the notion of using Shock: to do a Star Trek original series game, with the characters being the bridge crew.

That describes Star Trek TOS and TNG perfectly. Also, don't forget, TOS was supposed to have a bit of a space western feel. The Enterprise was out on the frontier, solving problems that the Federation's various client-states couldn't or wouldn't solve themselves or couldn't or wouldn't tell the Federation about, as well as exploring and performing various one-off missions at the request of Star Fleet Command.

That describes Star Trek TOS and TNG perfectly. Also, don't forget, TOS was supposed to have a bit of a space western feel. The Enterprise was out on the frontier, solving problems that the Federation's various client-states couldn't or wouldn't solve themselves or couldn't or wouldn't tell the Federation about, as well as exploring and performing various one-off missions at the request of Star Fleet Command. That sounds pretty Doggy to me.</blockquote>\nYeah, but Starfleet Officers aren't equals like Dogs, can't originate doctrine like Dogs and, at least in the original series, <i>don't change over time.</i> There is a big RESET button at the end of each episode for the characters. Really the only similarity between ST and what DitV does is the towns/worlds. DitV is all about the PCs' growth and change. TOS Star Trek is not about that. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I think you could play a fantastic game of Dogs using the trappings of the Star Trek universe, but I don't think it would be "the perfect system for Star Trek" because Starfleet Officers aren't Dogs.

(And even though I know it's the reason why many consider that particular incarnation of Trek very PC or milquetoast, I firmly believe it's one of the reasons why the show managed to attract a mainstream audience.)<br/><br/>And most traditional games do not really mesh with the rather careless attitude towards setting logic (the most obvious example being Trek's technobabble) in favour of dramatic license.<br/><br/>I've had great fun playing TOS-style games while playtesting Matt Wilson's Galactic. Although I'm not sure this is of any help to anyone. For DS9-style games, PTA is the way to go, I think.

I played a full 5-6 session campaign in the fall of '06.  That was basically TNG-ish (set very slightly later).<br/><br/>I ran a full academic-year-long Star Trek: Voyager Done Right game using a system of my own-ish design called Over the Edge of the Final Frontier.  This was before I got really heavily into story-games, so I'd story-game-ify it up a bit more before using it again, but the basic system was quite solid (because it was stolen from OtE, of course).  Let me know if you want to see it\u2014it could probably be used for TNG as well.<br/><br/>In addition to letting my players make their own characters (which of course was way cooler than what they had in the show\u2014can you say Joined Trill Captain?), another neat thing I did with that game was play it out in three separate generations\u2014it <i>actually</i> took them 70 years to get back to the Alpha Quadrant!  Which of course makes me think of Hero's Banner, even though I haven't played it.  The players either played older versions of their characters or made new characters in the succeeding generations.<br/><br/>DS9 is the best series, but I don't think I'd be interested in RPing it.

Quite sneakily, in TNG, most of the time when the Prime Directive has to be violated by the protagonists, someone else has previously violated it worse, and on Enterprise, they gleefully get themselves embroiled in situations and they always make it worse.  On Voyager there was no reason to even bother with it - the danger of imperialism when it's one ship far, far from home, is not appreciable.  If you don't want your characters to be high-tech gunboat diplomats dealing with indigenous peoples, there's a pretty strong institutional bias against it - that said, virtually every example in which a gamer says the Prime Directive is lame ("Are we really going to let that planet killing asteroid wipe out that civilization because of some stupid regulation?") is portrayed somewhere in the various series as being not a big deal if it's violated.<br/><br/>John Kim's advice to take the TV serieses as TV adaptations of "what really happened" is the game-creation engine for me. TOS was a high-concept space opera. TNG was a bit of committee porn in response to that and had a considerably greater concern for politics. Deep Space Nine was done by a noir director who was looking for a compelling ongoing story for the first time.  Voyager was an exploitation melodrama. And so on. That means you can use the ridiculously detailed canon, but you don't have to adopt the same cavalier attitude towards science/continuity/women/aliens/economics/etc. just because it's in there. You can say "well, the reason nobody mentions buying anything in TOS is because that just wasn't part of what the writers of those shows were getting at, and in the other serieses, traders like the Ferengi are played for laughs because economic issues just aren't what they were focusing on, but nevertheless those little dudes dealt themselves into the situation, which should tell you something about what REALLY happened..."<br/><br/>My wife and her best friend often chuckle that there were never any "good Vulcans" on the Star Trek shows. I disagree. I think the main problem was that the writers never let being Vulcan be right. There was never a show in which going with your true feelings was completely the wrong thing to do and a dispassionate analysis shows the way to the best outcome.  That's a sucky thing to do to player characters. There should always be a situation somewhere that they are the best match for. Basic spotlight sharing concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Perfect system for Star Trek - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8450/perfect-system-for-star-trek/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Perfect system for Star Trek - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8450/perfect-system-for-star-trek/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: JDCorleyJohn Kim's advice to take the TV serieses as TV adaptations of &quot;what really happened&quot; is the game-creation engine for me.

All the meaningless technobabble explanations that explain nothing, the bizarre ways that regulations are enforced or not enforced depending only on dramatic necessity, the way that it's always the same guys solving everything and going everywhere and doing everything even when there's supposedly hundreds of people on the ship who ought to at least be contributing something once in a while...it all makes perfect sense.  In the Federation, any given Star Trek episode is clearly labeled "Based on a true story" or "Ripped from the headlines!"  It's not just really goofy but sometimes charming TV in real life -- it's really goofy but sometimes charming TV <i>inside its own setting!</i><br/><br/>I am immediately stealing this idea and clutching it tightly against my black, withered heart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191638/#Comment_191638" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T08:07:40+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  8:07AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know.

The thing I'd have to say is you can't have a system that has consistent or balanced mechanics. In the series, technology only existed if it furthered the plot. There are tons of nit-picks about what they could have done if they'd used some technology that had been introduced previously. The closest to any mechanical consistency was the episode where it was determined that going faster than warp 6 had negative consequences on subspace, so a law was passed that you could only exceed warp 6 in emergencies. I'm not sure even how much that was followed in later seasons, as it was entirely inconsistent whether they had the Enterprise-D going off at the end of an episode at warp 2 or warp 5 or any other speed. Space battles were similar, sometimes they'd fire one shot and disarm the enemy, other times no effect. Sometimes they'd be hit to no effect, other times there would be major damage.<br/><br/>What I'd suggest is that a task resolution system really doesn't handle it. I'm actually not familiar with any conflict resolution systems, but I'm familiar enough with task resolution systems to know that they really don't do Star Trek well. Particularly I'd say that randomness in combat goes against star trek, and that they should be handled free-form. For instance when Worf wants to avenge K'Elhyr and kill Duras, it's very emotional. Worf should win or lose the fight based on how emphatically his player narrates the actions. If it really moves everyone, then he kills Duras. If it lands kind of flat, then the crew from the enterprise interfere. Similarly, when characters died it was because their actors wanted out. Their deaths were abrupt and sudden. It's almost as if character death in a ST:TNG game should only occur when the player decides their character has had it and they want them out. They give the GM/Narrator/etc permission to kill the character, and at some point in that session, something happens and the character is just dead. I think if a game really emulated the feel of the series, any mechanics and randomisation would only be present to drive the plot until someone has an idea of where to take things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8450/perfect-system-for-star-trek" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8450/perfect-system-for-star-trek" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8450/perfect-system-for-star-trek/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8450%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8450%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
