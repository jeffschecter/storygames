You have stats, roll d6 pools based on those stats, and spend "hits" (results of 4 or higher) one-for-one to address Obstacles (defined as things that preclude success) and Dangers (defined as unpleasant or compromising eventualities that can happen whether you succeed or not). If you address all the Obstacles, you succeed; if not, you don't. Despite what happens on that front, any Dangers you didn't address come true. So sometimes you accept failure in order to avoid Dangers, and sometimes you accept Dangers in order to succeed, and every now and then you get a clean victory.<br/><br/>In other words, it's Burning Wheel (the number of Obstacles is the same thing as the Ob in BW) mixed with Otherkind.<br/><br/>You can also add other stuff onto the framework, like FoRKs or systems for bonus dice or rerolls. It works pretty darn well; I just haven't published any of my games that use it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345606/#Comment_345606" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T16:26:32+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  4:26PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I remember working out some of that in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12262" rel="nofollow">my old thread</a>, Marshall. That's a really good way to go!<br/><br/>You can also do something like Otherkind Dice with different die sizes. For example, I designed a system where you always three dice. (There is usually one goal and two dangers.) You normally roll 3d6, but under certain circumstances, you can replace some of the d6s with a d8 or d10.<br/><br/>That gives a varying range of success; you can also vary the "target number" for success from 4 to 6 or even 7 or 8, if you wish.<br/><br/>You get even more options if you switch to a deck of cards.<br/><br/>We'll have to hear from Jeff (the OP) to see what he's actually looking for, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345612/#Comment_345612" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T19:30:23+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  7:30PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>You could use my BurningKind dice system.

(Which if you haven't checked out, run, don't walk, to get Don't Rest Your Head or play it at your nearest local game gathering).  WHRP3 feels a bit more generic and more widely applicable to adapting to another system. However, it uses custom dice that may or may not be tricky to adapt to use with more normal dice depending on how your brain works (or expensive to make on your own), whereas DRYH just uses different colored D6s, a style that's much easier to replicate.<br/><br/>I went into some more detail reviewing how WHRP3 works in a review years ago, on my old site: <a href="http://www.alvinfrewer.com/article.php?story=20091116113755829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.alvinfrewer.com/article.php?story=20091116113755829</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
