I'm trying to evoke the feel of an epic fantasy novel with my game, so the analogy I use is that the players generate an outline first and then flesh out the individual chapters (one difference between my game and what you propose is that the plot is not completely pre-determined since you don't know until play whether the protagonist or antagonist will "win"). In addition to problems with the game itself (too much complexity, certain mechanics not being fun in play, etc.) I think that players who are used to "character advocacy" style play are having trouble adapting to the "it's not <i>what</i> happens, but <i>how</i> it happens" kind of thing I was shooting for.

This is the question or issue that will be answered/addressed in the final stage of the game, and which all play ultimately moves toward. After that, you create characters that will fit into the type of story that ends this way. Then you create goals for your characters that specifically do NOT aim them at the Endgame, but are intended to finish fleshing out the initial character, and get them into motion. Once they are in motion, more goals will be created that will push toward Endgame, or which will distract, to explore side plots. The interaction of these two different types of goals is intended to work as an organic pacing mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nTricky things about this sort of setup include creating an Endgame that doesn't prescript too much. It should be just strong enough to unify the direction of the campaign without limiting ways or means of addressing the Endgame. Another tricky thing is the creation of individual goals, both in determining what is interesting, and deciding whether or not a goal pushes toward Endgame. It's been brought up that you might decide that it does, then as it unfolds it becomes obvious that it doesn't, or vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee a couple abstracted run-throughs of this setup <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9993&amp;page=1#Item_64" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28524.0" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the former, there's some whispered talk between myself and Mike Holmes where he expresses some grave doubts about how much fun and how functional this could be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264240/#Comment_264240" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-27T18:51:27+00:00" title="March 27, 2010  6:51PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think anyone that likes really super-structured genres is probably okay with this to a degree that would surprise them.

You've still got that sense of discovery. The same is generally true of the type of roleplaying game where the GM has prescripted out much of the story, and the players are interested in discovering the GM's story through play. Where this breaks down is where the players are part of the prescripting; They lose the sense of discovery. Where I think I dodge that bullet is that my Endgames are specifically not supposed to prescript much of anything, so much as simply give a general shape to the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tell me...

With my game, I'm trying to bring in some of the ideas I'm using in my fiction writing. I listen to a lot of writing podcasts for inspiration, motivation, etc., and one of the most common topics is whether or not particular writers outline their work ahead of time or use a "discovery writing" process of just seeing where the story goes as they write. It seemed to me that the "character advocacy" style of play used by a lot of posters here (i.e. knowing a character really well, and pushing for their agenda as hard as you can in order to see what happens when they run into other characters doing the same thing for their own agendas) mapped to the "discovery writing" process but that there weren't a lot of games that mapped to the outlining process. A lot of discovery writers report that they lose interest in a project when they outline it because they already know what will happen. I don't get that feeling until I get to the editing and revision phase, unless I stick too much detail in the outline and then the writing feels more like editing and is laborious rather than exciting. So I think the key for "defined plot" gaming is to find the right level of detail in the plot so that it still gives you a reliable skeleton to do things like explore character without creating a suffocating environment for further creativity. I think that different people will draw that line in different places so you'll never be able to satisfy 100% of people with this style of game (and I think the same applies to pure "character advocacy" games, too), but there are probably some good sweet spots that we'll be able to find through experimentation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264281/#Comment_264281" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T13:29:24+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  1:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>In a movie, book or video game where everything is prescripted, it's okay, because the reader doesn't know where it's going.

We actively choose to watch, read or play things knowing how they are to conclude and with a good understanding of how the narrative will reach that conclusion. Luke will defeat Vader, Marty will get back to 1985, Holmes will solve the case and Oliver will escape Fagin; the resolution of conflict, while in nearly always an inevitability in a satisfying narrative, is pleasantly expected by the audience. Post-modernism offers exceptions, of course, but for the most part this manner of consumption is unchallenged.<br><br>In reality, I think we, as consumers, are far more interested in 'discovering' how these events will occur. We know Holmes <i>will</i> solve the case, what keeps us reading (or watching) is the revelation of how. This is the key to the pre-scripted game. <br>For example: Our characters (or rather, the roles we happen to be playing at this time) will fight and mine will die while yours is forced to flee. That's what the narrative says, but what happens in the fight, how I am to die and for what reason you must escape the scene are still open to being discovered in play. Even if the 'script' adds more prexistant detail ("You shoot me in the chest"), how that interaction goes down is central to our enjoyment of the scene. Just because we can't be surprised by events doesn't mean we can't derive pleasure from them.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264285/#Comment_264285" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T15:59:39+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  3:59PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2010 4:02PM by Burr.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a prescripted game, you could keep open some of the what-discovery by allowing or requiring it to be in the how-discovery of a different protagonist.

It's the unpacking of the scene, the 'how' of the prescripted event, in which the meat of the action is found and the majority of our interest. We know Luke will be victorious at the end of <i>Return of the Jedi</i> but it's the verbal sparring, action of the duel and final moving exchange that entertain us. <br><br>If I was scripting with a group of players, <i>RotJ</i> would end thus:<br>1.Luke confronts Vader for the final time in the presence of the Emperor. <br>3.The Emperor is unsuccessful in tempting Luke towards the dark-side. Luke reveals the existence of Leia to Vader. <br>2.As Luke is about to kill Vader the Emperor intercedes but, at the cost of his own life, Vader betrays his master to save his son.<br>4.Luke bids farewell to his redeemed Father and flees.<br><br>Of course, we can make this script more complex to represent those characters attempting to destroy the Death Star and easily interweave that action with the above. There's still so much potential entertainment; both in the discovery-of-how,  the fun of roleplaying and seeing a plot constructed by the group bare fruit. It's a departure from traditional styles of gameplay but there's no reason to say it's pointless. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Because when you all know where the story is supposed to go, the only thing left to do is to fight over whether your way of getting there is better than your friends' way.

Whereas normally, it'd come as surprise, because we don't know it's going to happen at all, so we can all enjoy the surprise.<br/><br/>But it also depends on how authority is distributed. That's the worst-case scenario if everyone has authority. But if only one person has authority:<br/><br/>In normal play, I can try doing different things to see if I can get someone to spill a secret, and the fun is seeing a) how much it takes, and b) whether I'll get someone to spill the secret or if something entirely different will happen instead, because I'm not ready to pay the price or do what I need to do for that person to spill the secret. But if you are the one responsible for the secret, and the only one who can spill it, then I'm just talking at you until I do something that satisfied you enough to spill the secret. And that's kind of like playing "Mother, may I", with an overly-railroading GM, with all the attendant risks.<br/><br/>How does your group go about doing this? Maybe you have a clever trick that sidesteps this kind of problem.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264597/#Comment_264597" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T21:40:14+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  9:40PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you guys should look at what Jeepform games do.

Big part of the enjoyment can be playing your role, thinking and being like another person, feeling your character's emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying a role in a theater play is fun, despite the actors know the script by memory and know at all moments what will happen. When you listen to a song that you've listened before one thousand times, you are not looking to discover anything, you know every note in the song in your head, but you enjoy the emotions that the song still makes you feel. Even in literature, using "suspense" to engage the reader is considered a cheap trick. In summary, in art there's a thousand elements of enjoyment besides discovery and plot. There's a million reasons to "bother".<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso when you are playing a character, maybe you know how the story will end, but your character doesn't, so you can suspend your disbelief when getting in character and still feel this sensations of surprise and discovery, if that's what you are after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265336/#Comment_265336" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T12:27:22+00:00" title="April  3, 2010 12:27PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can think of several designs that have explored fertile ground in this area:<br><br>Ben Robbins' Microscope starts by defining broad epochs of a timeline, then naming specific events within those, then (jumping around as interest dictates) zooming all the way in and playing out how "the humiliation of the Emperor before the Senate" actually goes. It's cool because we don't actually know what ramifications the scene will have before we play it out. Did that actually signal the decline of the Empire? Or fuel his ambition all the more? Or did it spur his wife's infidelity which led to a young prince's exile and the founding of a new colony? Or what?<br><br>Robert Bohl's Misspent Youth plots each episodic adventure along a rough three-act structure, telling the Authority Figure (GM) what each of seven scenes should be about and how to direct them. It doesn't quite dictate the outcome, but it heavily skews the odds toward "OK, in this scene the kids will suffer a crippling defeat, but when it all seems hopeless, the next scene will feature their improbable and exhilarating victory!" But it still leaves room for the long-shot result that overturns the structure.<br/><br/>And then there's Shab-Al-Hiri Roach which defines a series of events throughout the school year that WILL be played out, but of course the REAL meat of play is the power struggle and roachifying which is overlaid on that and UTTERLY unpredictable.<br/><br/>(COMPELTE Tangent--I just realized the Roach's structure could have some fruitful applications toward a Harry Potter application.
