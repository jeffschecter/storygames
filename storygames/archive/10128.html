Choosing and arranging words was fun, and that play produces a poetic artifact, a kind of picture-book libretto, pleased me immensely.  I would absolutely play it again, and would especially love to try it for a longer series of sessions.  I wonder if it would adapt to campaign play with a varying pool of players?<br/><br/>Two of the players were young, and invested in making the story incoherently silly, or just maximizing their ability to negate whatever was being claimed by the storyteller.  I joked at one point about only adding words like "not," "didn't," and "couldn't," but on the whole, it was surprisingly disruption-resistant.  When you pull tangled threads in different directions, they mesh and knot to make something unexpected, but strong.  Or some other metaphor.<br/><br/>I see that the playtest draft has been altered to only let you roll three dice at one time.  That's probably for the best.  Some of our players were rolling 16 at a time, resulting in much longer sentences, resulting in coins getting flipped sooner than they would have, resulting in the game ending sooner than it would have.<br/><br/>Here's the story we came up with:<br/><br/><b>Happy Birthday, Robot!</b><br/>by Dee, Chris, George and Nick<br/><br/><br/>Happy Birthday, Robot!<br/><br/>Robot wakes up and checks his fluffy pink cellphone, but the battery is dead.<br/><br/>Robot sighs and makes coffee, but the coffeepot is broken.<br/><br/>The sun shines warmly on red Robot, and he feels at peace, but radioactive bunnies fall from the sky!<br/><br/>Robot braces against their scolding words, but falls down hard.<br/><br/>Rising to his feet, Robot laughs a cheerful laugh and shoots the bunnies down with his happiness-inducing laser-vision.<br/><br/>Robot and bunnies start to break-dance maniacally, but the bunnies begin to bite him.<br/><br/>The epic fight was soon over, and the voracious bunnies were exhausted for days.<br/><br/>Robot looks upon his work and is glad, but still feels despair for the enslaved bunnies.<br/><br/>Robot cries as he finds a single dead bunny nearby, so he brings it back to life, but Bun-Bun was changed!<br/><br/>[Ed: endgame triggered here.]<br/><br/>Bun-Bun bit other bunnies, changing them into creatures that fed on brains.<br/><br/>Satisfied, Robot went home.  "I should charge my cellphone now."<br/><br/>Robot received seven birthday messages; how auspicious!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the bunnies plotted Robot's massacre.<br/><br/>THE END</blockquote>\nAwesome. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Nick later mentions in comments that he isn't sure if he should identify the bits he contributed. That's kinda cool, I think. An artifact so inherently collaborative in its creation that you don't want to take it apart.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bevedog" title="bevedog"><img alt="bevedog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stevelawson.name/icons/steve-in-3D-32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bevedog">bevedog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224831/#Comment_224831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T07:51:03+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  7:51AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I really like this, and I have a friend who is a poet whom I think will love this.
