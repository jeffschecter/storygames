                    Inspired by a terrible D&amp;D game I participated in at Dreamation and after having discussed the point with a few people at the 'Con, I was hoping to get people's stories about how they've managed to <i>tastefully</i> leave a table where they weren't having a positive play experience. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the game is unsalvageable, that you've either exhausted all potential avenues of making it more enjoyable and otherwise you just know you want to get out of it. I'll further qualify and say that I think I'm only talking about Con games here, for the most part with strangers.<br/><br/>Can this be done?<br/><br/>Is it more important to salvage your limited time at a 'Con or try not to hurt anyone's feelings? <br/><br/>What about disrupt a game for people who might otherwise be enjoying themselves?                </div>

                            By the time I give up a game as unsalvageable, I'm usually having a psychosomatic sense of exhaustion.  It <i>draings</i> me, having things suck that much.<br/>
<br/>
So, generally, I'll say "Y'know what guys, if I were feeling more up to this I would stay, but I'm just really spent.  I gotta get some rest, or I forfeit the entire rest of the convention.  Sorry, but you'll have to carry on without me."<br/>
<br/>
It has the benefit of being true (if slanted in what it omits) and I've yet to encounter anyone who is anything other than sympathetic.  Then, when they see you bouncing off the walls later, you say "Yeah, I had some snacks and took it easy for a while, and I bounced right back," and they feel all good about having helped you enjoy the con!                        </div>

                            If the game is really that bad, then just stand up, get everyone's attention, and try something like, "Hey, folks, I am going to step out. I can see you guys are having fun but I'm not, so I don't want to drag you down. Later!" If they press for an explanation, I recommend soothing egos and punting a bit. "It's nothing personal. I'd be happy to talk about it in detail after your game is over, but I don't want to sidetrack you all more than I already have. Find me later and we'll chat."<br><br>Do follow up with the GM or players, if they're friends of yours, and explain what happened. Be mature and expect maturity. Remember that not everyone enjoys the same things. Your lousy time is someone else's awesome.                        </br></br></div>

                            I couldn't do it.  The GM had made it so that the players were too dependent upon each-other.  I might be okay with making a GM sad/angry that I can't continue--although I wouldn't tell him why at that moment--but I'm not going to screw another player too.<br><br>In a game where it would matter less I might, although I'm convinced that I got some valuable experience about what not to do when running a game by staying and playing.  It's a hard question and I guess my decision would be based on whether or not I thought I could get into something better--even if that meant just grabbing a bite to eat so I could free up time elsewhere.<br/><br/>I think, for now, since I did stay, I would have to say my current answer is to ride it out.  I do want to see what others have done.                        </br></br></div>

                            Great question. I like Tony's answer.<br/><br/>Last year, I played a LARP which I hated: all the players had gone off into groups and weren't talking to me. After an unproductive chat with the GM,  I said "Look, I'm not in the mood for this, could I leave?". He said "Sure, if you have to, do what you've got to do". I was clearly not enjoying myself, and probably bringing other people down, so I think he was relieved when I went. And so was I.<br/><br/>I think it's important to do it tactfully (I prefer Tony's "I'm tired" to Adam's "I'm not having fun"). Also, it's not to be done lightly, because it will disrupt the game.<br/><br/>To answer this bit...
<blockquote>Can this be done?<br/><br/>Is it more important to salvage your limited time at a 'Con or try not to hurt anyone's feelings?<br/><br/>What about disrupt a game for people who might otherwise be enjoying themselves?</blockquote>
...of course, it's a balance. You can't leave every game you're not 100% happy with. But if you've tried everything, and you really have to get out, then you're probably pissing everyone else off anyway, and it's best to leave.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Why is "I'm not having fun" a tactless answer? (Please read my tone as curious, rather than annoyed or defensive.)<br/><br/>Is this one of those situations where we should find a polite white lie to avoid the truth of the situation? Why is "I'm not having fun" something that would hurt other people, especially if the other gamers seem to be having fun. It's not your thing, but it's theirs. "I'm not having fun" isn't at all the same as "what you're doing isn't fun," though I could see how others might construe it as such. Are the two things too easily confused and thus we need to take special care to avoid suggesting the wrong thing?                        </div>

                            It's hard to leave--for me anyway.  Maybe there is a hope it will get better.  I played in a horrible D&amp;D game at the last Dexcon because the GM simply railroaded the PCs along the track he previously established.  Our player 'insurrection' took the form of our characters stopped looking for clues to prove the bad guy was the bad guy and we just confronted him.  We were forcing the DM to either kill our characters or have our characters kill the bad guy.  In either case, the game would be over once the scene was over.  <br/>
But the upshot was I decided that I think I can run a better game than what I played in, so I set out to do just that.  I ran a few games at Dreamation that I think worked out ok--and I apologize to anyone in my games if they weren't having fun.  <br/>

I couldn't go that route.  To the other players, that would seem like too much of a slight on them. Plus it offers up the chance that the GM would say, "Oh, stick around for 10 more minutes, I've got something great coming up!", etc.<br/><br/>I prefer Tony's.<br/><br/>I have ducked out of sucky events before.  Back in the mid 90s in GenCon Milwaukee, when I played pretty much nonstop D&amp;D with a session or two of other games like Castle Falkenstein or Shadowrun, I would find myself in a game where it just was boring as fuck.<br/><br/>I'd basically make it seem like I was the one to blame. In one session, I was kinda feeling tired, so I pretty much used something similar to Tony's excuse above.  Another game I had the feeling that the game would suck right off the bat: No one seemed to have any energy or drive. Luckily, I asked the GM there, "Hey man I might have to duck out after an hour to meet back up with my group, is it OK if I play until then? If an alternate shows up for this game, that's totally cool with me". After about 40 minutes, it just wasn't popping, even though I did give a good shot at digging in with some roleplaying (I literally remember nothing of the scenario or the other players or even GM now, as it was such a totally mediocre game). I just gave the GM that knowing "Crap, looks like I have to go after all" look, apologized to everyone, made a show of saying "Hope that I see you in my other games", and bailed.<br/><br/>I have on one or two occasions like Shane stayed in a game that was "slightly above mediocre" (usually because I suddenly realized that I was about 3 hours in and not having as much fun as other games), however it's sometimes hard: I've seen people who become noticably bored with a game start trying to (perhaps subconsciously) sabotage it.  Flipping out and killing the other party members and the like, being a drag, getting in the way of the scenario, etc. I haven't done that myself but I have noticed myself get very close to that level once or twice.<br/><br/>Luckily, and this is a strange realization, I haven't had a shitty con game session for like... damn... years? The last one I walked out on was in 1996 or something. Been to GenCon a few times since, been participating heavily in area cons, played everything from Exalted to D&amp;D and haven't had the need to gnaw off a limb and escape.  I think part of that was choosing games that I knew would have a better chance of not sucking: Looking at the DM list and asking around about the DM ("Yeah, that guy ROCKS as a DM!" etc), getting clues from the game description, staying out of pre-made adventures (ones that are handed to GMs) in favor of ones that look like the GM created it, etc.<br/><br/>Blake: Damn, I hate to go there, but what happened in that game that made you want to bail?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            This is a fantastic topic for discussion.  I think as a weird subculture we're generally averse to conflict and are overly polite in person.  I've had the misfortune of being in deeply unsatisfying games at cons (not recently, thank God) and I've always stayed, even times when I would have rather gnawed my own leg off to get away.  I feel like this is changing for me (we'll see), but why behave like this in the first place?  Not sure.                        </div>

                            To mirror a bit of what Shane is saying, for me it depends on the players and type of game. If I think it will screw the other players, I will stay. But if I do not think it will matter, then how I act depends on what I think the GM can take or in some cases deserves. If the GMs is a jerk, I'll let them know that is why I am leaving. Otherwise I will just try to be as subtle as possible if I think it will hurt their feelings. I don't feel too well. I made a mistake in my schedule. Text a friend to call my cell and so on. If I think the person will be understanding, I will just be completely honest and tell them that I misunderstood what the game was about and I don't think it is for me. But ultimately I don't want to screw the other players.                        </div>

                            Cross-posted with Adam above:
<blockquote>Is this one of those situations where we should find a polite white lie to avoid the truth of the situation?</blockquote>
Absolutely.
<blockquote>Why is "I'm not having fun" something that would hurt other people, especially if the other gamers seem to be having fun.</blockquote>
OK, here's the Japanese response to that answer, as I've seen this kind of thing totally nuke social situations in Japan: Tone it down to get the result in US social communications:<br/><br/>When you say "I'm not having fun", you've essentially issued an utterance. But not keeping that shit to yourself, you've basically put it on the other people to:<br/>1) Make it more fun for you, somehow.<br/>2) Reflect upon why it is not fun for you (ie 'become guilty')<br/><br/>By keeping it to yourself, or issuing a white lie, you've extricated yourself from the situation without leaving points 1 or 2 in the air. <br/><br/>In Japanese communications, saying "I'm not having fun" is nothing less than saying "Please make it more fun for me" and/or "You should feel guilty that I am not having fun".  Again, Japan =/= American RPG Convention, but I do think the social nuance is still there.<br/><br/>If you had a shitty time because the GM was a fuckhead, and one or more players were obnoxious boors, and you want to stick it to them, say that you're not having fun. If you want to get out of the situation without them thinking that they might have done something wrong, then say "I'm really tired guys", or "Huh, my phone just vibrated, I got an emergency, I gotta go and I'm really sorry". <br/><br/>Basically, saying "I'm not having fun" is like serving a ball to start a conversation, then running away before that conversation can conclude. The ONLY good thing that can come from it is:<br/><br/>(after you leave)<br/>PLAYER ONE: I dunno what that guy's problem is, I'm having fun.<br/>PLAYER TWO: Yeah, what an ass.
<blockquote> "I'm not having fun" isn't at all the same as "what you're doing isn't fun," though I could see how others might construe it as such.</blockquote>
It's not so much as "What you're doing isn't fun" (though there's a hint of that), again by issuing that utterance you're putting a burden on the listener: A burden to reflect on why it isn't fun for you, and to perhaps do something about it.<br/><br/>Human beings have invented the white lie for a reason. It is a piece of grand social evolution. Deciding not to make use of it in social situations is like not making use of silverware to eat your food.
<blockquote> Are the two things too easily confused and thus we need to take special care to avoid suggesting the wrong thing?</blockquote>
I'm of the opinion that we should always take care to avoid hurting other people's feelings, or dampening their fun. Less suffering = better.  But again, if I were in a game with a total dickweed GM or players, and others weren't having fun, I'd sure as shit loudly state that I wasn't having any fun, and perhaps make a group vote to call off the game. But in a situation where I feel that *I'm* the one with a problem ("This game isn't fun <b>for me</b>"), then I'll excuse myself in a way that doesn't put any burden on them. It's my problem, no need to burden them with it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy: <br/><br/>Nothing too exotic. "Living" style game with very progress-oriented players, meaning that my somewhat unoptimized Dwarf Rogue was looked upon as as a nuisance, roleplaying at the table never extended above the obligatory level -- there was one other player at the table who had a roleplaying sense, but clearly saw himself as a table alpha and I realized in short order he was more of a talkbox than someone who you could interact with. Normally, I can settle down and roll some dice and try to derive some pleasure out of it that way, but the module was geared toward hyper-optimized characters, meaning I failed more or less every single roll I made. I tried to make fun of abysmally failing everything, but I think I was the only one amused by that too.<br/><br/>To be fair, I have a lot of friends in other regions (Greater Boston, Northern and Southern Cali, etc) who play in the "Living" campaigns who enjoy them a great deal (I suspect they stack the tables with people that they already know). Part of the reason I wanted to get involved (despite having deep reservations about whether or not it'd be any fun) is that it seemed cool that I could play D&amp;D with my Living character while visiting them in other areas.                        </div>

                            I agree that it's an odd artifact of RPGs and Game Conventions that this problem even exists. I have a way around this problem. It's the one that Jason has discovered, and Andy. Hence why they have had better luck of late.<br/>
<br/>
Don't play games at Cons with people you haven't gotten to know. It's a "convention." Where you go to convene with people. And then play games with them. It's not a "anonymention." This isn't a chess tournament. It's RPGs.<br/>
<br/>
If you've signed up for a game without really knowing anything about it (and that includes a fifty word convention schedule blurb), and it turns out to be something you didn't expect, then you are the problem. Suffer through it, and then play a game with somebody you know.<br/>

                            In general, I don't leave games that aren't fun without first trying to make them fun. The exception, of course, is when someone at the game is being abusive to me, but then that's an entirely different problem requiring different skills to resolve. Luckily, it's reallyreallyreally rare.<br><br>I'll respectfully disagree with Andy and others who think it's boorish to say you're not having fun. To craft a white lie so that people won't freak about it seems to buy into the weird subculture "I'm responsible for everyone else's fun" thing. No, dude. I'm responsible for my fun. If I can't make this game fun for me, then I should do something else. Really, if anyone says "What an ass" or "I dunno what that guy's problem is, I'm having fun" after I leave, that doesn't reflect well on them. I'm not <i>inflicting</i> anything on them by being friendly and polite and bowing out with a simple "hey, this isn't fun for me" statement. You're suggesting that if I did this, I'd be eating with my dirty hands after stabbing the GM with the fork. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> <br><br>But I'll back off a bit because it's obvious that some people would consider my actions rude, therefore my actions <i>are</i> rude. That's how social stuff works so I'm forced to reevaluate my opinions. I'm just surprised that people think this is rude. <br><br>I totally understand the value of the white lie as social lubricant. Just want to make that clear to people. I swear I'm not a boor.<br/><br/>I don't see the middle ground here though. Why isn't it rude to get up and make a white lie and strand the other gamers? or to leave after alternates have long given up on gaming? after the GM has lovingly crafted a wrongbadfun dungeon for your enjoyment? It seems the purpose of the white lie isn't just to save other people's feelings, but to protect your own reputation. "He's not being rude; he's just not feeling well." Am I misreading or misinterpreting that?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Good questions, Adam. <br/><br/>This is somewhat tangential, but related.  I have a comment about this from the other side of the table, as the game facilitator.  At Dreamation, I actually had several people leave to do other things. But it happened with each of them that there were two people playing their character, so the loss of that player disrupted the game not one whit.  And, luckily, the people weren't actually bored, just had things to do--everyone eventually rejoined the game again--but it felt great to me to be able to offer them the flexibility that was needed for them to go and come back. <br/><br/>Now that's not something that can be done in every game, but it does make me think about some of the aspects of the situation that <i>make</i> it more socially awkward to have to back out. If the same situation arose while playing poker, any of us could say "deal me out". (Well, unless you were the one with everyone's money, perhaps <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It's harder in most rpgs because of the interdependence.                        </div>

                            Hey man: Totally understanding that you're inflating the issue to use hyperbole (and I love that way of describing it: "Comic Book sized"), my reply:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Rather than telling you that I'm not having fun, and possibly thus allowing you to better understand that not everyone wants the same thing from a game or that there may be issues you could want to address, I am going to lie to you and make it so that whenever someone tells you they have to leave because they are tired a part of your mind wonders if they are leaving because you suck.</blockquote>
Absoluetly. <br/><br/>First, it's not one's job at conventions to sit in regular gaming sessions, wait until things get mediocre, then say "I'm not having fun", derailing the session so that you can proclaim why Your Fun is Different and how they could have taken the time to address your fun (perhaps while wagging a finger).  Here I'm specifically thinking of the example above, where Blake sat in a mediocre game of D&amp;D (rather than, say, a mediocre session of some 4-person Sorcerer game where everyone has made it clear that they want to know right then and there if you're not having fun, or you're playing with 3 buddies and one stranger, yadda yadda yadda). <br/><br/>And believe me, the mind will wander, thinking "I wonder why that dude left. Is he really tired, or is something else going on?"  But that is nothing compared to someone saying "Hey guys, I'm just not having fun. It's just my style, it's not your fault".  That's like dropping a Jewish mother style guilt-bomb, leaving the room injured with questions and doubt.
<blockquote>I find it fascinating that we would rather lie to people then possibly maybe make them somehow uncomfortable. </blockquote>
I find it fascinating that our bodies have evolved and yet we pass waste through the same holes used to make babies. There's nothing I can particularly <b>do</b> about it. In both cases, it's just a product of the human (social) animal. Wishing that people wouldn't take offense or leap to conclusions would be like wishing for a second, seperate penis for the passage of waste.
<blockquote>I am not giving you a chance to get my constructive criticism later, because I am going to pretend there isn't a problem to maintain a social fiction that allows us all to continue being avoidant.</blockquote>
There's a difference between being avoidant and courteous. <br/><br/>But, to back it up a bit and give a real example of that last point there: You DO have a chance to give constructive criticism: Just approach the GM after the game and let him know what happened.<br/><br/>A while back, I was in a con game running some game (I forget which) for a bunch of people: One of the players ducked out because he was really tired.  I knew that something was up, because he was acting "funny" before he left, but I took him at his face value (because we were all pretty tired at that point, to the point of distraction).  The next day, he talked to me off to the side: Turns out that there were one or two places that he was looking for an "in" but I wasn't giving it to him. My bad, and I thanked him for that feedback.  However, the main reason was that there was a player at the table that he wasn't getting along with, and in his words , "If I didn't get away from the table I was going to strangle that bitch".  Turns out that the rest of us, after he left, continued to play for a while longer and made it through the adventure fine.  If that player who left basically said "I can't take this" and proceeded to rail on that person because she was being a dick, then the scenario would have bombed for all of us.<br/><br/>Instead, he came up to me later to give me positive criticism, and to drop the Real Reason.  So there is possibility of feedback and criticism even in the White Lie scenario.  <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I think part of the reason why the "white lie" mechanism works is because most everybody knows it for what it is- a polite exit excuse.  They don't necessarily have to believe you, or even think about it any further- they officially don't have to worry about it.  Politeness is all about forms, and this one is generally acceptable.  Failing to use one of those accepted forms sends a challenge signal- it says that you expect them to respond in some way (to debate you, to fix it,  to learn from your action, etc.).<br/><br/>I think this is complicated further when you're playing a demo of a game with the creator.  To stand up and say you're not having any fun is bound to make the creator (and all the players) feel uncomfortable, if not insulted.  I've seen this happen at one of Luke's <i>Burning Wheel</i> games (understandably, it was toward the end of a very drawn out Duel of Wits), and it was a chilly moment for everybody.                        </div>

                            I think you are absolutely right, Steve, that nobody is fooled by an "Oh, crap!  I forgot to water the car!" exit, or a "Whew!  I am exhausted!" exit.  Particularly since those people will be seeing you shortly, around the con, hob-nobbing and rocking out in other games having a demonstrably better time of it.                        </div>

                            Andy, <br/><br/>All good points. And all the reasons I still do tell the white lie rather than tell the truth. However, after having told the lie I can say I'm rarely going to go back later and say to the GM "Yea, I lied earlier. Your game wasn't fun, and here's why..." because, well... I'm not. If I'm going to tell the GM there is a problem I'll either stick it through to the end and then tell them, or tell them there is a problem in the moment with the agreement we don't have to chase it more until after the game is over. Telling the fib to get out easy and then coming back with the double punch later seems... I dunno, bold faced wrong? <br/><br/>Now, the best point is that we don't want to drop a bomb on the game in the middle of the game. Fucking up the game for everyone else is FUBARED. But why is it that saying we aren't having fun must do that? One thing we most seem to agree on is that when someone drops the "not having fun" bomb, it can lead to discomfort, guilt, and chilly moments. Why is that? Why should one person at the table not having fun (or admitting they don't have fun) be a ruiner? <br/><br/>Now, I know it can be. Especially if its done poorly or done with an agenda. I also know some reasons why even at the best of times it can be (as your Japanese examples show very well). But why is it so paralyzing for us? Especially if we all know it is a lie? If we all know its a lie, we're already knowing you aren't having fun, so why must you lie about it? <br/><br/>Because in blind date terms, let me tell you, not everyone is reassured by the white lie. For some people it makes it much, much worse.                        </div>

                            I second Andy's sentiment.  In my long years I have only come to learn that making people feel better in relaxed social environments is better than being honest.<br/><br/>It would be wonderful to assume everyone is going to be mature about it and go on with the show but it's my experience that people aren't like that.  I spent long years rationally and even gently telling people what I thought and levying constructive criticism and all it got me was abunch of folk that thought I was contrary and mean.<br/><br/>Yes, Adam, there is a certain matter of reputation.  I think keeping everything civil and all "british tea Party" -like makes for a better social environment.  I'm not particularly concerned about what other people think of me on the other hand not many folks want to be that guy that's a dick, even if that guy is right.  Right does not make up for being a jackass.  Sure, once you get to know the blokes and can raz or insert some critigue but it's my opinion that those sorts of comments are only constructive when solicited.  <br/><br/>Andy is absolutely right - "Sorry but this isn't for me" carries with it a value judgement for most people.  Unless you know the person and they have told you otherwise I think it's better to bow out gracefully.  I wish I had the problem Brand has, unable or unwilling to take someone aside and let them know what's going on.  I often find myself running off at the mouth and it's never been my experience that it is appreciated unless asked.<br/><br/>It's funny.  Drama and discomfort is often something we strive for in many conflict-ridden stories but when it comes down to it we're all here trying to have fun and if tension is going to ruin that fun it's not really welcome.                        </div>

                            Hmmm, fascinating thread.<br/><br/>Now, disclaimer: I haven't played in a Con-game yet, so I can only comment on what I know, which is excusing myself from sucky games with people I know. <br/><br/>That said, I generally prefer the honest approach to the white lies. If I'm not having fun,for whatever reason I generally try to be honest (and nice) about it, though I try to salvage a game before actually quitting. But I really don't like lying to people I game with, just asI don't like it when other people lie to "be polite". (And I really dislike that. I actually prefer people telling me "Your games sucks" to any white lie like "Sorry, gotta go, my dog just died".)<br/><br/>So, if I ever play in a sucky con game and really seeno way to salvage the situation, i'd probably take the honest approach here too. It might not be as polite as it can be, but I'll take honest over polite anytime.                        </div>

                            Hmmm... I've bowed out of games with a simple, "this isn't working for me." I usually have gathered my stuff to make my exit quick beforehand to make my disturbance as small as possible. I'd prefer to have the simple truth myself. For me the truth is a sign of respect. I don't lie to my friends even when it hurts them. My best friends are the same way, even if it's only with me, because they know that's how I am. Sometimes it sucks, but I've always found the hard truth more useful for learning than the white lie that's meant to spare my ego. Now gaming with strangers doesn't make them my friend but I have a modicum of respect for the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't mean I'm calling you folks disrespectful, as you are trying to be considerate of people's feelings. I just find your view point fascinating as I never considered that my method could be seen as rude. Not that I'm terribly concerned about being seen as rude, I just find it interesting.                        </div>

                            As A GM I'd much rather you leave my table than sit there and not have fun.  Your lack of fun having can cause a fun-vacuume sucking all of the fun from the table.  I also have no problem with the white lies. <br>
<br>
Tactics that have been used to get out of my games:<br/>
Cell phone call from girlfriend locked out of hotel;  "Oh my god where are my keys?"; "I'm really tired" (not Tony)<br/>
not returning from a bathroom break. <br/>
<br/>
The Bathroom Break guy was the most disruptive because the table waited 15 minuted before we went on without him.<br/>
<br/>
As a GM of Everway, Rare and Indie RPGs I'm not hurt or insulted if someone leaves my table.  The games I run are not to everyones tastes.  besides Ive made enough fans of people who love to play with me as GM, to give me a cushin of confidence in my GMing skills.<br/>
<br/>
I've sat through too many 4 hour (and one 8hr) games that sucked for me to do that again.  I'm not getting younger.<br/>
Because of that for many years I wouldn't play in a game that I wasn't sure of the GM. and I was comitment phobic about trying new games.<br/>
<br/>
when I realized that I wasn't trapped it freed me to try new things.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know th warning signs, If the GM starts talking about his grup back home that the game is based off and makes reference to too many "inside jokes" and stuff I don't get, I leave. If teh GM or another player is making me uncomfortable, I leave.  If I'm being railroaded AND the I can see that we the players are just there to see NPC fight NPC and then have NPC rescue us...I leave.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I say I have a headache.  The last time I just apologised and said this was not what I thought it was and left.<br/>

                            As far as Mike's comments go I have to say that one can convene with people you don't know.  Some folks are coming from a distance and are wanting to learn about new games.  Although many smart gamers pick their battles and find the good GMs that doesn't really help anyone.  I mean there was a time that when I went to a convention players flocked to it.  I slacked and went to less cons and eventually that rep sorta faded.  I want to build it back up but if no one's willing to play because I am an unknown then there is no way for that to realistically happen.  How is a mature new GM that wants to learn supposed to get feedback?  How do we filter other player's agendas or find out what they don't like might be something I do?  I mean I am certain I could go to a convention in South America and there might be a host of people that say "nah, that guy sucks.  Here play this really cool fantasy heartbreaker."  Only to find out he's running one of these hippie story-games I so love.<br/><br/>Experimentation and exploration is good and healthy.  Talking about ways how to bow out when you see your over your head is something I think more people should talk about.<br/><br/>More importantly I think it's important for us, here, people who are forming relationships, let others know what they'd want us to do if the guy on the otherside of the table was them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

I would agree if I thought someone would learn something.  I have found, more often than not, that they just blame you anyway.  And usually not in a "this just isn't his thing" kinda way.  I have seen people bow out of games on both accounts and the banter after isn't often constructive.  It's just not worth the added disruption.<br/><br/>I would even prefer the "I have to meet someone so I have to go" to someone that just wanders off and leaves the question of their return unanswered.                        </div>

                            Is this some sort of cultural difference?  <br/><br/>In my experience, white lies are a basic part of socializing.  For example, if I am at a party, it is customary to give the host some excuse of why I have to go, rather than saying "I'm not having fun at this party" and walking out.  That's because the host of the party does have some ego invested in their party being fun.  In general, I try to give some reassurance that I'm not criticizing what the host has done.  <br/><br/>I don't care much for formal manners or politeness, but I do care about people's feelings -- and in my experience, people's feelings are often hurt by saying something like "Your party sucks".  Particularly if it's a party at a convention or somesuch, it doesn't cost me anything to make an excuse.  <br/><br/>(<i>Last comment moved over to split thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2300&amp;page=1#Item_4" rel="nofollow"><b>[Cons] Do you game with people you know?</b></a></i>)                        </div>

                            Andy really said it best, there is a value judgement there, period.  You may not mean it that way but 9 times out of 10 it's how it's taken.  In my experience it's just the way people are (people as groups as compared to individuals one gets to know).  "I don't like X" inevidably turns into "your opinion is crap."  Some people have the gift of making it sound ncie and making you feel good about yourself after saying it but the reality is that it hurts feelings and I see no value in doing so just to be "honest."  Remember that honesty has a subjective nature.  It's over-valued in our culture becasue it's one of those things that mnay people espouse they want but rarely does anyone want to hear unless it's good or agrees with them.  If you don't want to lie then say "many apologies but I have to bow out folks."  But I just don't think "this isn't for me' isn't going to do the majority any good.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: segedy</cite>I think part of the reason why the "white lie" mechanism works is because most everybody knows it for what it is- a polite exit excuse. They don't necessarily have to believe you, or even think about it any further- they officially don't have to worry about it. Politeness is all about forms, and this one is generally acceptable. Failing to use one of those accepted forms sends a challenge signal- it says that you expect them to respond in some way (to debate you, to fix it, to learn from your action, etc.).</blockquote>
Yeah, I think this is really what it is, honestly.  If someone says, "Hey guys, I'm really tired, so I'm going to bow out," they're giving me permission not to worry about it.  If someone says, "This really isn't fun for me, so I'm going to go," I think, "Gosh, was there something they expected me to do that I wasn't doing?"  Now, chances are that if someone begs off with an excuse, I'll probably think about it later and see if I can analyze if there was something else going on, but it's not as disruptive in the moment.  It's really all about social maneuvers.<br/><br/>On the other hand, for some reason, "Sorry, I'm just not feeling this tonight," is much more of a, "I'm tired and I"m going to step out" response to me than a "Sorry, I'm not having fun" response.  Which is odd, because "I'm not feeling this" and "I'm not having fun" are pretty much synonymous, but they have a different feel to me.                        </div>

                            Kirsten, <br/><br/>That may have to do with Don's "some people just have a gift for it" issue. Sometimes just having the right words can be the biggest issue. In the case of "I'm not feeling this" it's a subjective thing where the weight is on you, "I am just not able to make it happen for myself" where in a social/entertainment situation where we're supposed to help each other have fun a flat "I'm not having fun" carries connotations of "because you guys didn't deliver." <br/><br/>Don, <br/><br/>Cool. Thanks for your input man. It helps sometimes to have voices other than those in my head to talk to.                        </div>

                            Give me the white lie, offered without sarcasm.  If I'm the GM, it's minimally disruptive and lets me get on with the flow of the game.  Ditto if I'm another player.  Just slide out without a splash, please.  If you care to offer feedback later, I'll gladly take it.  <i>But not at the table.</i><br/><br/>Turning it around, what is the especial virtue in emphasizing you're leaving because you're not having fun?  A number of you are equating that approach with respect and truthfulness for the hobby, the Con, the GM, gaming culture, etc.  Doing so seems to put a lot more weight on what's essentially a decision to leave a social endeavor than the circumstances warrant.  I'm actually OK with "this isn't working for me, bye," but I'd rather have a simple "sorry, but I have to leave."  Lest anyone go Jack Nicholson on me, this isn't "you can't handle the truth."  I just wanna play.  If it's not working for you, cool.  Slide out, talk to me later.<br/><br/>Saying, "I'm not having fun" could parse as, "Jeez-sus Christ, Mr. HollyhockGuideMaster, you are not entertaining me," or "I just accidently braided my testicles into a knot and have to go to the hospital."  In more serious vein, I don't know from that statement alone whether it's me or it's you--but at the table I don't want to freeze play and deconstruct.  The "I'm not having fun" offers a judgment on the game and maybe on me, but doesn't provide useful information.  Consider it as having an invisible "because" attached.  There's a world of difference between "I wasn't having fun because you steamrollered all my efforts to engage my character's flaw in the scenario" and "I wasn't having fun because my ex-girlfriend walked into the room with her new lover."<br/><br/>And even if you did offer useful information, you're leaving, so unless I totally stop the game to get into a Q&amp;A, that's all I'm getting.  Plus the game has probably lost whatever momentum it had.  So yeah, step out smoothly, offer feedback later if you're so inclined.  If you don't care to do the latter, maybe I'll look you up.  Or not.<br/><br/>-Blake                        </div>

<i>I find it fascinating that our bodies have evolved and yet we pass waste through the same holes used to make babies. - Andy</i><br/>You men. So unevolved.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, I've had to leave a couple games. Once I didn't care a bit what the GM thought, he was being an ass. So I went and read/slept in the living room while they gamed in the kitchen. The second time, I really did have coursework I needed to be doing, and I really didn't have time to commit to a (second) weekly game session. I basically think Andy's right, and saying "This is not fun for me" can be rude. I also think Blake is right, and leaving with minimal impact is good. So, finding social ways to ditch out, even if everyone knows it's a ditch-out, is good. I'd way rather have someone walk away from a game I was running than sit there and disengage/derail. <br/><br/>There was one time, though, when a GM puled a really crappy 'ok, you're locked in a room and I'm going to shoot down everything you try' on the party. We all got frusterated at about the same speed. I was a little afraid it was going to result in somebody leaving, but the GM finally picked up a clue and let us solve the damn locked box and get on with the adventure. <br/><br/>In our regular games, there are times when I've said "This isn't clicking for me tonight, can we just hang out?" and that's cool. It's different at a Con where you've paid to game, though.                        </div>

                            Once, um, in a game with Gary Gygax, we all got fed up and passed around a note that said "Try to die"--and went for the TPK. It was a horror game ... but it was harder than it maybe ought to have been. I'm not sure I'd do it the same way again.<br/><br/>Tony's answer is my preferred one for the reasons John elucidates. Why is it important to make sure people know that stuff? Because they wasted your time? Because after you tried to make things fun they stopped you (again and again?)? I mean, if you need to impart to your dinner-host that their steak sucks and their wine is cheap, yeah, that's 'honest'--but is that really anything you'd want to do to someone you gave a damn about? If there was no reason to?<br/><br/>I'll note that Tony isn't <i>lying</i>--and I wouldn't be either if it were me ("I'm not up to this--guys--I need a break. Gotta regain some steam."). I don't think it's about integrity. I think it's about being heard.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            Oh, <i>and</i>, it depends on the situation. If you can grab a private moment with the GM, while everyone's getting drinks, I think it's fine to say "Listen, I'm not enjoying this much, can I duck out?". I've known people do this in LARPs. Apart from anything else, it gives the GM the chance to ask why and possibly try and put things right.<br/><br/>Similarly, if there's been a moment of weirdness, and everyone can see you're uncomfortable, there's no point saying "Look, I'm tired, can I go?". Best to be honest: "Listen, this isn't my sort of game, can I duck out?".<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm finding this thread really dull, so I'm off now. See ya!<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            OK, crossposting with Mike on the "Conning with Friends" tip:
<blockquote><b>Mike Holmes Said:</b><br><br>I play with people I've never met previously. Lots.<br><br>What I also do, however, is get to know the people that I'm playing with. It's really not hard. Instead of saying, "Hi, this game is HQ, here are the pregens - which do you want to play?" I say something like, "Hi, my name is Mike Holmes. I'm a member of the MOLAD demo team, blah, blah. I'm a programmer/analyst from Wisconsin, married, and have two kids. Nice to meet you all. What's your name?"<br><br>I socialize.<br/><br/>Here's the point. If I do this, and make the sort of instant friends that one can make at cons, I enable these players to be able to bow out of my game like this, "You know Mike, this just isn't my thing. Would it be cool if I left to try something else?"<br/><br/>And then it's not some stranger dissing my game, but somebody I know telling me the honest truth.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is to be social. It's that lack of socializing, treating RPG play at cons as if it were two chess opponent's meeting over a table, that makes any social interaction difficult at conventions. If you actually try to get to know the people with whom you're playing, spend ten minutes of your time on basic socializing, I garuntee you that your games will have a much higher rate of success.</br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>
That's actually a very good idea, and totally fits in with all that Social Contract babble that most of us take at face value.<br/><br/>* If you run a game, introduce yourself. Get some brief introductions out there, so everyone knows each other. Maybe do a non-lame icebreaker.<br/>* As a GM, tell people that if they're not enjoying themselves, that it's totally cool to leave in the middle, for whatever reason. But that you prefer feedback later at the con sometimes if that happens.<br/>* Then get the game rolling.<br/><br/>I've had really successful games at pretty much every con I've been to for years now, and when we start I tend to (as GM) start off the adventure with a bang about 10 minutes into the session: The first 10 minutes are usually people finding the table, settling in, making conversation.  Making it a little more structured would be a cool thing: 5 minutes for finding the table and chatty-chat, then 5 minutes for introduction, then an explosive game start.<br/><br/>In any case, maybe doing some people-to-people introductions at the beginning of the game, followed by a quick "lines and veils" of the table itself ("It's cool if you need to break, just let me know. And if this game isn't what you were looking for, it's Totally Fine with me if you leave.") would work wonders. Promote behavior that is open, giving the players an out if they want it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Kinda what I'm getting at, Adam. It's not a sensible response, but it's very human to feel that a stranger leaving your game is more insulting than somebody you know. The kneejerk response to some stranger saying, "Sorry, not having fun" for many is "Jerk, who does he think he is?" As opposed to, if you know the person, "Ah, well, too bad this wasn't what my aquaintance wanted to do."<br/>
<br/>
Really it makes a huge difference. It's very easy to take affront with something done by a total stranger. The same act from somebody you feel there's a connection with - even if it's just a slight one made moments ago - is often totally justifiable in the mind of the recipient.<br/>
<br/>
I recall playing with Clyde, having him in my HQ game at ForgeCon. Right at the beginning, I think he introduced himself to me, and we got to understand that we had gotten to know each other online previously. Later, in play, he had some negative comments about my game. Not that he said it was totally bad, but just that some things seemed odd to him (frankly I can't recall what was said precisely). And my thought was, "Huh, I'll have to take that into consideration next time." Had I not known Clyde, and his temperament and personality, I might have totally taken that differently, had he given me the same straightforward feedback as a total stranger.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>So, given that it's pretty widely accepted as rude to tell people you're not having fun at a con game, is it also rude to tell people you're not having fun at a private game run at your friend's house?</blockquote>
Familiarity comes with it the ability to be more upfront, at least in my view.<br><br>Last night at my weekly board game gathering, one of the players was very clearly not having any fun.  He resorted to a attitude I considered childish, the height of which was ignoring us and reading when he needed to do his turn &amp; participate, then complaining that it the game sucked because he wasn't having a good time.  However, he continued playing, being very passive-aggressive about the situation, and he started ruining our fun.  When we started confronting him about his obvious lack of enjoyment and what we could do to help, he declined every idea, and then I heavy-handedly said that we should quit playing then.<br><br>I don't think it occurred to him that he could say "hey guys, I'm not having fun" and bow out.  Given that we were all friends, it would have been a down note, but one I wouldn't have taken as rude.  If I'm demoing a game at a con and someone I didn't know said that to me, I probably would take some offense at "I'm not having any fun" (though I wouldn't show it) partly because I feel responsible for their fun.  But this is my friend in my home, and by being familiar with him, so if he's not having fun and is going to fix that by leaving for that reason, that's alright -- I don't feel responsible for his fun in the same way.<br><br>Someone mentioned the classic blind date out, where a friend calls you to see if you need at out.  In a blind date, it would be pretty crass to say "uh, thanks but no thanks -- I'm not having any fun with you."  To extend the analogy, if you get involved with someone, communication is important.  Now not only is it okay to say "hey, I'm not having fun" but important, because you're going to keep playing games with these people.<br><br>Naturally, there are ways to go about this that don't hurt people's feelings or break down group cohesion, but in general saying to your regular group "guys, this isn't working for me" is not only not rude, but necessary.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Is this some sort of cultural difference?</blockquote>
Hi John,<br/><br/>I doubt I'll be able to explain well in one go, so feel free to prod or point at holes where I'm not clear.<br/><br/>Yes. I think it is a cultural difference. Robert Pirsig, my favorite philosopher of the last century, perhaps any century, said in I believe his first book that one of the greatest cultural problems in America is a conflict between what he saw as traditional Native American culture, and European culture. He spends more time on it than I am going to here. If you're interested he's only written two books which are both in paperback, "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", and "Lila." I wonder if this might add to push/pull? I can't say as I only know someone was working on that theory but haven't taken the time to delve into it yet. Anyway....<br/><br/>In general the clash as I see it here is between expectations. I see it in the references to giving a white lie to the host of a party. I'd rather use a band. So I had a kid ask me at a show what I thought of his Rockabilly band. This came about as my friend Matt directed him to ask me, either to mess with the kid or me, I'm not sure. I told him the truth, I didn't like the band at all. He then started asking me questions because I think he was looking for constructive criticism. My response to him was, "Why are you spending so much energy in finding out why I didn't like your show when all of these kids loved your band?" I feel the same way about this topic. If someone doesn't like a game I'm running, that really has no reflection on me unless perhaps no one is having fun. If one person dips out because they aren't having fun, I really could care less. I think that's a positive thing, not because they negatively affect the game or whatever, but because I don't have the same host expectations as other folks do. I think this is cultural. <br/><br/>Just like I think that I miss the white lies is cultural. If you tell me you are sleepy, or have to do something for your wife, I'm likely to believe that if I don't know you well. Eventually I learn that you aren't operating under the same cultural ideas as I am, and learn that I have to question what you're really saying, to find your real meaning. Just like some of my close friends learn to give me exactly what they mean without the White Lies. My other close friends already operate with the same cultural values.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite><cite>Posted By: Clyde L. Rhoer</cite>Sometimes it sucks, but I've always found the hard truth more useful for learning than the white lie that's meant to spare my ego.</blockquote>
I would agree if I thought someone would learn something.  I have found, more often than not, that they just blame you anyway.  And usually not in a "this just isn't his thing" kinda way.  I have seen people bow out of games on both accounts and the banter after isn't often constructive.  It's just not worth the added disruption.<br/><br/>I would even prefer the "I have to meet someone so I have to go" to someone that just wanders off and leaves the question of their return unanswered.<br/><br/>Hi Eruditus,<br/><br/>I found your response interesting. You say, "more often than not," that people go on to blame you. This implies that sometimes people don't blame you, which leaves the possibility that some people could learn. In your experience are there times people don't blame you for walking away from the table, or was it just a choice of words that didn't express your position well?<br/><br/>I would understand a choice of words that didn't express your position well, as the quote you took from my post was bad communication on my part. I was speaking of Life in general in that sentence and not specifically leaving the table.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/><br/>Really it makes a huge difference. It's very easy to take affront with something done by a total stranger. The same act from somebody you feel there's a connection with - even if it's just a slight one made moments ago - is often totally justifiable in the mind of the recipient.<br/><br/>I recall playing with Clyde, having him in my HQ game at ForgeCon. Right at the beginning, I think he introduced himself to me, and we got to understand that we had gotten to know each other online previously. Later, in play, he had some negative comments about my game. Not that he said it was totally bad, but just that some things seemed odd to him (frankly I can't recall what was said precisely).

Hi Mike,<br/><br/>As far as I know, I made no criticism of the games we played at Gen Con. I had fun at Gen Con, and enjoyed playing games with you as you run a really good game. I do remember making a criticism of the game at Forgecon which is where we met, because you, like a surprising amount of folks at Forgecon, were friendly with the guy with facial tattoos. I expected a much colder reception. Anyway, the criticism was that I had no idea what was going on in the setting, and didn't realize things like fighting the flying vampire/elf/plant thing was like deciding to take on Cthulu. It was a really small criticism, because that was a great game. What I find interesting is you seem to have placed that after we knew each other a bit better at Gen Con. I imagine that's due to my previous post in the thread, and looking for examples to back up Andy's post, and perhaps even to back me up. <br/><br/><strong>Hi everybody,</strong><br/><br/>So I like Andy's idea of being upfront about it being okay to leave a game. What I want to know is if I presented at the beginning of a game that I don't mind if you leave for whatever reason, just let me know the truth, would you believe me, or would you assume it's one of those things that is said but not meant?                        </div>

Sometimes it is an odd world.  If I was at a con game that didn't go well and I felt the GM was open-minded, I might see if I could strike up a conversation about how the game didn't work -- after the game was done and people were on their way, of course.<br/><br/>Conversely, I've had GMs in gaming groups I've been in where the game is just utterly unenjoyable, but I kept going because there were players in the group that asked me to stick around.  I knew all these guys -- we hung out regularly -- and it's that familiarity that told me if I tried talking to the GM about his game, it would have gone over rather poorly.<br/><br/>With that, I should amend my statement:  Familiarity provides understanding.  That understanding gives us the ability to know when and how to be more upfront about our gaming problems -- indeed, to know if we can be at all -- whereas we lack that in convention environments where you game with folks you don't know.  (I just wish that didn't sound so long-winded.)                        </div>

One thing to bear in mind is: I'm not just concerned about offending you: I'm concerned about spoiling the other players' fun. So, personally, I'd believe that that was what you wanted me to do, but I still wouldn't want to do it. I'd probably never withdraw from a table saying "I'm not enjoying this". I might say "This isn't my sort of thing".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            If the GM was upfront about it being cool to tell him the truth about his game, I think I would want to stick around just to hang out with them, regardless of the game! <br/><br/>I do think there are cultural difference but also many other differences (maybe the person was up all night and is cranky). I mentioned it earlier but for me it depends on the specific people involved. My cultural upbringing may celebrate blunt honesty as the default solution but if my audience doesn't feel the same, then I think as a communicator I've failed somehow. For me, it's about the audience and tailoring my style of communication to them, regardless of my initial instincts. <br/><br/>Going with what Mike was saying, being social, introducing yourself, becoming acquainted is extremely important and allows you to connect and feel out who your audience is and what style of communication is most appropriate.                        </div>

<br/>
I meant ForgeCon (did I say GenCon?). And I meant that we knew each other from previous encounters on the web. Through, IIRC, the indieunderground madison site?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, to the extent we were unaquianted before ForgeCon, that makes my point all the better. By being social with each other, we managed to make a situation where your critique of my game was more acceptable. That is, big or small, what you said may have bugged me if you were a complete stranger, if I hadn't gotten a feel for you as a very direct sort of person. I might not have understood that this is your way of being respectful.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, I really appreciate the critique. I've even modified the scenario in question to adjust for what you said. If you'd been some random guy that I hadn't felt any connection with, I might have thought instead, "Damn piker, what does he know!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been approaching this topic from the POV of the GM. Who does, in a con environment, have more control over the social situation than anyone else (generally the players look to the GM at such an event to organize it this way). But, that said, consider, too, that you as a player can also work to make the event more social. Most folks here do already. But it can't hurt to keep it in mind. If you've gone out of your way to make the actual aquaintance of the GM, you'll probably have much less trouble if you have to say something negative about the game.<br/>

                            First, Blake, damn you for stealing my thread idear.<br><br>Second, Jason, I really <i>did</i> have to go do my taxes, honest!<br><br>I've got a few points to make after reading the entire thread, and they may not flow nicely, one to the next.<br><br>First, I am an honesty fetishist, so I feel a powerful desire to be brutally honest where possible.  However, I still don't tell people I'm not having fun when I leave.  Worse, I usually don't leave.  I suffer and try desperately to extract fun from the situation, sometimes to the point where I ruin other people's (bad, wrong) fun.<br><br>To whit, I will merely invoke Hot Sauce and not delve into it except to say: I was a crappy player at this extraordinarily bad game.  I mean, I think I did a good job roleplaying, and I think I entertained my fellow players, but if I was being careful and honest I would have recognized this as a railroady, illusionist game and that 5/7ths of the table were excited about it in this regard.  Instead of just going along with this or quitting politely (or even rudely), I decided to engage in my-guy-ism and gave up the McGuffin to the opposition once given an in-character reason for it.  I will partly defend my choices, because I really did have in-character reasons for what I was doing!  But I probably should've been more mature and found a way out of the game.<br><br>I can't stop myself, though, sometimes.  I itch and burn to squeeze fun out of the situation, or not cut out before giving them the chance to improve.<br><br/>--<br/><br/>I think that, rather than its being a weird cultural thing <i>not</i> to be honest when people suck, it's the weird geek culture that even makes us consider telling people that they're not entertaining you.  I think the normal human way of doing things would be to just white-lie your way out.  But the Aspergery, geeky, must-always-be-accurate thing we (I say "we" for a reason, mind) are afflicted with causes us to be compelled to be insulting without even realizing it.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Finally, I since I made the decision to only play indie games at cons, I don't have this problem anymore.  I routinely play with people I don't know, and still get to have fun.  I am not saying that indie games are a guaranteed panacea for this problem, but I am saying that they help.  Or have in my experience.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I got half way through the thread and figured I would put in my two cents in before finishing my reading <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Mike, <br/>I don't think you're off-base at all with the socializing thing.  I mean in many regards that's why we do this as compared to sitting home playing CIV IV or Oblivion.  That between game interaction is really far more important than many people give it credit.<br/><br/>I go a little further.  I usually try to keep that issue open by keeping those expectations clear.  We talk a lot about Social Contract but I think that if you know what your getting into ahead of time you probably alleviate the question about bowing out almost entirely.  I try to make it clear (and should probably strive to do so even more clearly) if your having any issues flag me down, take me to the side and if it's not reconsilable (sp???) please bow out.  By me taking responsibility for that decision and telling people that it's okay I can't complain if it happens.  I have also played games where I asked when choosing amd making characters "what's going to be the thrust of the game?  Will there be much interaction with each other and NPC's?  Will you let us know when we get to a 'deal-breaker' plot hook?"  I have even been a little naughty and wrote in beliefs before a game, stating them clearly and hopeing my actions spurred others to do the same. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Rob hits it on the head in that I find myself hijacking a game far more than leaving it.  Especially if I am trapped in a situation where I have nowhere to go.  A few months back I played in a Unknown Armies game that went south.  The game wasn't horrible but my characters was just a sucker - everyone was better and what he did, and I mean significantly so.  My skills were like Acting and the highest was around 25% while others had investigation and interrogation at 50s +.  Even if I were to be the schmoozing loser characters those scenes that I tried to roleplay through got glossed over for "the plot."  But I was in a room filled with "Living" games.  This was to be the closest to any game in the event in this slot I would have been remotely interested in playing and the people I brought were having lots of fun.  I ended up nodding off. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/>  *Bad Don*                        </div>

<b>As a player:</b> I guess I hijack too, though I like to think of it as being proactive.  :-)  I try very hard to <i>make</i> the game fun because I don't want to be a "consumer" player, one who wants the GM and the rest of the table to entertain her as if they were part of a movie.  I feel -- and not just in games -- that if something is off-kilter, the first thing I should check is whether I can help improve things.  This does in fact help in a LOT of games; I've seen GMs who were very grateful that one player would start dragging the others into being more active than reactive or passive.<br/>
<br/>
So if the game still sucks for me, it's usually because the GM is not interested in proactive players.  On rare occasion, the GM is fine but the rest of the group is composed of cavemen.  I usually tough it out to the bitter end, but if something is offensive enough to drive me to walk off, I politely but sternly tell people why.  Note that merely dull is not enough to drive me off.  It has to be rank ass-hat behaviour to do the trick, so I don't feel I need to give white lies.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I often play alongside my husband; since one of us is usually the GM in our regular games, that is a big attraction of cons that they give us a chance to both be players together.  As a result, we have more momentum when trying to rescue a game.  But we also have much more impact if we decide to walk, which is why it's very rare (I can't recall us ever walking off together.)<br/>
<br/>
<b>As GM:</b> Give me the white lie, give me the truth, I don't care.  But TELL me you're not coming back.  Don't leave the rest of the group hanging, waiting for your return.  Also, a related behaviour I really hate: people who register in multiple games at once and browse, deciding which one they'll stick with.  It's disruptive, it prevents other players from getting the spot, and it's rude.                        </div>

                            Excellent discussion.<br><br>The only con game from which I've bowed out was a GURPS event at GenCon '05; my first (and so far, only) time ever playing GURPS, ironically. It was advertised as an intro to the system, but wasn't; the GM let in 8-9 players, two of whom were playing the same PC ("You're twins!"); we're wandering around a land where the natives all speak French, but only one PC does; and everyone is making scat jokes and playing the female PCs as whiny bimbos, <i>as instructed by the GM</i>. It was idiotic.<br><br>I blew straight past the white lie and simply said, "Sorry, guys, I have to go."<br><br>At the same con, my English buddy also left an event midway, but did so via a "Bollocks! This game is shite!" I often wish I had done the same (and had his accent with which to do so).<br/><br/>I can see both sides of the politeness issue, but the only opinion I can offer is: it depends.<br/><br/>In the case of something like my GURPS event, I would have loved to be blunt. These were grown men acting like idiots and exemplifying every bad gaming cliche. Would it have been so wrong to let the GM (a SJG MIB demo team member) know that, hey, this is not how you sell people on your game of choice? Oh, and take a freaking shower! Oy!<br/><br/>However, assuming you realize that the issue lay with you, and not the event itself, I don't see anything wrong with a polite exit.<br/><br/>I run events regularly for ENWorld Gamedays, and I've run one at GenCon in the past. I definitely noticed the "chess tournament" thing early on, and it's always bugged me.* I try to make a point of at least going around the table and getting everyone's names. The idea of telling people up-front that it's okay to leave if you're not having fun is fantastic; I'll start doing that.**<br/><br/><br/>* Is this just a geek thing? Nerdy folk too scared to talk to strangers? I'm not gregarious by any means, but I'd at least like to know the names of the people I'm going to sharing an imagined space with for the next four hours.<br/><br/>** Did I mention how much I love the "discovery" of the social contract? Best thing to happen to gaming evar.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
