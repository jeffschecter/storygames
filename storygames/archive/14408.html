In the last two months, I've playtested a number of mine, played Fiasco twice, played George's Children, Montsegur, and done a dry-run on someone else's playtest material.<br/><br/>And I've noticed a disturbing trend regardless of the group... the last scene always plays out worse than it should. Perhaps players aren't comfortable with the responsibility of wrapping up the story or the fact that writing the end to a story is in fact that hardest part. There's a lot of reasons why this could be happening....<br/><br/>An example.<br/><br/>I watched as players did a 5-player test of my samurai story-game about guilt and betrayal. The story was amazing. The conflicts strong. And after running it six times now, I can see that it has a great deal of replay value. However, left to their own devices, players are not required to tell a good finale (which is endemic of any act structure orientation game like Montsegur and so on). Someone can just drop the ball or fall on the story grenade and squash all the tension.<br/><br/>Am I making sense?<br/><br/>My brain is offering up theories as to why this is happening, but I'd be curious if anyone else finds that their final scene stinks or fails to wrap up the loose ends or even address the plot?!?!?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327577/#Comment_327577" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T13:42:20+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  1:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Professionals screw this up.

The other half pretty much always end very well.  I can't recall the last time a game ended with a crappy ending.<br/><br/>I think typically, it's all about pacing and this is usually in the GM's hands.  Normally you're building up to this grand finale and you need to know right when to cut-off and narrate the end without stretching things too far.  <br/><br/>Part of it is identifying where the game will actually end.  If you're running a one-shot, you need to be able to pick up where the game is going and drive towards that.<br/><br/>Have you played The Mountain Witch or Dust Devils?  Both of those games do a great job of giving you a general idea of where the game is going so that you can easily pace the session and brings things to a boil as the end emerges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327580/#Comment_327580" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T13:54:32+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  1:54PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If last night's Lady Blackbird one-shot is any indicator, highly content-structured games can sort of "bottom out" once you reach the end of the content.<br/>For instance, once the crew got off the Owl, it wasn't quite clear how to proceed. <br/>Fortunately, the GM advice helps with this a lot - when you're stumped, ask questions to get ideas! When players devise a plan, ask questions about the plan and its outcome so you can think up "cool obstacles" to present. <br/>Additionally, refresh scenes are pretty great - they provide a mechanical "excuse" for doing a nice down-time scene without much conflict. They help the game tread water a little while the GM's creative juices replenish - ideal for one-shots!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327589/#Comment_327589" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T15:33:39+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  3:33PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think my last scenes are brilliant, memorable and wonderful, but for niggling reasons I suspect the players in my current group don't.

I want to add "and then..." and keep on going with it, because I'm enjoying myself so much.<br/><br/>This is particularly true of games where our characters have been through a lot, and have just had a serious impact on the world around them.  It's a natural place for us to stop and move on to a new game, but doing so means we don't get to see and enjoy the results of all our effort.  It's like we just invented a new toy and put it back in the box right away, without even playing with it a little bit.  That's just cruel.<br/><br/>I'm learning to be a fan of endings, though, even the ones that seem to come too soon.  Knowing the end is coming seems to bring out the best in us (or at least offsets the cautious habits of some of us), and it's better to have a game that ends solidly than one that drags on and on before fizzling out.  It also helps if we leave the door open for a sequel, because then I can tell myself that we'll get to come back and do some more with this material in a year or two.  And sometimes we do, which is awesome.<br/><br/>(...but we'll probably still make wisecracks during those majestic final scenes, because that's what our group does: no matter how serious the scene, there's a vein of humor running through it, and we are totally going to mine it.  At the end of the day our group is basically a bunch of people who like making each other laugh, and that usually takes precedence over drama and solemnity.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327624/#Comment_327624" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T03:40:07+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  3:40AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think cutting scenes short works better.<br/>Last Werewolf game I played, my character (the pack leader) died after the final battle and we ended it there, with me dying.

I'm always disappointed with how Terry Pratchett ends Disc World books. Great characters, interesting situations, dramitic build up and then an ending that just doesn't pull it all together. It's like he wants the story to not really end. That would be true to life but is not good for stories, which is where games run headlong into a wall. On going games are not like stories they are more like real life - ie no plot. <br/><br/>When a game is plotless (ie has no end in mind) no one knows how to end it. Maybe the game master has to just jump in when the players aren't looking and say "And the camera pulls back and fades out." when a good moment appears. It's GM fiat but would work. Getting the players to do this takes a lot more work. <br/><br/>My old Matrix game products did not have a forced outcome. It was all up to the players - which worked well sometimes but often didn't. When I added in action tokens to time the game the players at least knew the game was coming to an end but they still didn't know what to do to end things. Now I'm trying a heavily scripted approach that gives players a problem that the game design presets. If they solve the problem they say how it ends. If they don't they get a preset stake. That gives a solid ending one way or the other. I've not played Montsegur but we all know that the Catholic take the castle in the end and that the Crusaders historically killed everyone "God will know his own" so they game has a train wreck ending that you all know is coming. The game is what you do on the train before the crash and if you can get off. With Fiasco the players can just ignore end of the game cranks or threaten to beat them up. But recognize that when people can't think of anything good they often get silly to cover up their discomfort. More predictability makes for more comfort which might make for a more creativity. <br/><br/>It really is a challenge between too much freedom and too much structure.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327629/#Comment_327629" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T05:45:17+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  5:45AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>I'm wondering if there's some control aspect (that can be added to any game?) that can be used to guide the finale into the hands of the player who has accumulated the most monkey points or whatever.</blockquote>\nSociety of Dreamers does this.

Part of it, I think, is that the entire game is building towards this confrontation with the Witch, so everyone is ready for that to be the end? I dunno.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think there's a skill to ending well. When you've had however many sessions of super fun time, and then it's that last session, and everyone could very well keep on playing unto forever, but the game is pretty much over, but people still want to throw in that last little bit, that last comment, and then you have a two-hour final scene that ends up feeling overextended - blah. When I run games I tend to err on the site of cutting things early rather than let them run on.<br/><br/>Also, I like epilogues a lot! Like, it's that climactic scene, and the good guys are finally victorious and the volcano erupts. End! Game over! And then go around and get each players epilogue for their character. The story is resolved, but we still get to hear that little bit more about the fallout from that ending.

He just dropped the ball on the final scene. Perhaps on purpose. Perhaps because he had to pee and wanted out of the game. Perhaps because he's a control freak and wanted everyone to know it. I don't know. But I've gamed with him before and he's a fantastic roleplayer. So. Perhaps, unexpected bad endings would also be an appropriate theme for this post.<br/><br/>And yes, I know building a control into every game to cover every possible contingency of "jerkness" is a ridiculous expectation. But gaming with people new to Story Games, they feel the need to get all kinds of closure too soon and that can ruin endings just as much as people who have the jerk-factor.<br/><br/>I'm not sure there's a solution, but it won't stop me from pissing and moaning about it.

Many games I play now require emotional and creative investment from me in a way that many of the games I used to play did not. I still do the old school dungeon crawl thing occasionally and those game sessions tend to run longer because they don't require the same type of investment from me. I'm not talking quantity or degree of emotional/creative investment, but that they seem to draw from different wells. Some of those wells seem to deplete more readily than others.<br/><br/>The other thing is that as I've gotten older I've become less inclined to put play before other interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327986/#Comment_327986" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T10:13:25+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 10:13AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I actually get to play it, no it usually comes out rather well.
