Thinking about possible stuff to make and sell, it occurs to me that a whole bunch of these things could also be used for RPG type stuff.<br/><br/>Buttons take a bit of an initial investment (a proper button maker costs at least $100, often $300 or more), but make it easy to make money back if you can actually sell them as an impulse buy type thing. I could totally see using buttons as some kind of game components, whether very small ones serving as pawns or miniatures, or larger ones containing game material themselves.<br/><br/>Indie comic events always have people selling mini-comics. You can make a quick 16 or 20 pages worth of comics, print up a little booklet that you can photocopy and staple, and sell it for a few dollars each. There have been a few RPGs to toy with this general kind of format, like XXXXtreme Street Luge, MicroLite 20, and more recently Weird West, and Annie Rush did a few such games (like House of Horiku) a few years back.<br/><br/>It's harder to imagine T-shirts tying into an RPG, but then it's *really* rare to see RPGs actually try that kind of thing. My rule for making T-shirts is that it should be possible for someone who's never heard of whatever you're making to want to buy the T-shirt. (And <a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=MSPA-POSE&amp;Category_Code=MSPA" rel="nofollow">this</a> is one of the few webcomic shirts I really want to get.)<br/><br/>Anyway. I'm not really going anywhere in particular with this (I have a headache right now), but I thought I'd throw this out there while it's on my mind.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325439/#Comment_325439" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T04:16:15+00:00" title="May 20, 2011  4:16AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see tiny little mini style hacks for games being a nice little impulse grab.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325442/#Comment_325442" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T04:56:11+00:00" title="May 20, 2011  4:56AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used <a href="http://www.busybeaver.net/" rel="nofollow">Busy Beaver</a> to supply me with give-away buttons, the modest cost* of which I chalk up to marketing and goodwill.<br/><br/>I think we already see a little of this (Tim Rodriguez was selling his InSpectres hack for $1 at Dreamation) and it will only grow. <br/><br/>It's a little dodgy, to me, to be selling games priced at only a few dollars - there's tangible value in just having people engaging with your work, and if the effort and production value doesn't demand real money**  my impulse is to give it away, with thanks, or to revisit it until it is a better value proposition for real money. <br/><br/>*About $12.50 per event I attend<br/>** You know it when you ask people to give it to you.

Mostly, I use it to make buttons for local punk bands on a for-barter or free-because-I-like-you basis, but I did a small run of indie rpg buttons for me and a couple of others at one point. I've done Agon, Dictionary of Mu, Bliss Stage, and Beast Hunters from what I can recall. I've also gotten a button or two included with most of the new Burning Wheel books I've pre-ordered over the years, which is a cool little extra that I've always appreciated.\n<blockquote>It's harder to imagine T-shirts tying into an RPG, but then it's *really* rare to see RPGs actually try that kind of thing.

Whenever BWHQ releases a new book, they usually have a tie-in shirt that's only available for a limited time as a preorder, so they don't have to worry about keeping stock around and guessing sizes, etc. I honestly wish I had -more- cool rpg shirts. I love the three BW shirts that I have; John Harper's Go Play NW shirts are great too. I keep talking about taking a silk screening course at the local youth non-profit, and if I ever do it for real, I plan to print up a shirt with the Bliss Stage triangle on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325481/#Comment_325481" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T09:41:15+00:00" title="May 20, 2011  9:41AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It's a little dodgy, to me, to be selling games priced at only a few dollars - there's tangible value in just having people engaging with your work, and if the effort and production value doesn't demand real money** my impulse is to give it away, with thanks, or to revisit it until it is a better value proposition for real money.</blockquote>\nOn the one hand I like the idea of even further breaking down the notion that an RPG has to be a giant hardback tome (I know Jake Richmond has said he's had people look at his newer games and say "That's too small to be an RPG!"), but on the other hand I can definitely get behind having something that costs, like, a quarter to print (5 photocopies and a couple of staples?) for free, especially as a bundle with an existing game. With Maid RPG we had a few leftover scenarios that got cut from the actual book because of time constraints, so Andy printed up some copies to give to people who bought the game (along with putting the PDF up on the site).<br/><br/>And thanks for the link to Busy Beaver!

So a shitty game you paid thirty dollars for has more subjective "worth" than an amazing PDF you paid nothing for.<br/><br/>The comics guys selling artsy mini-books may have this beat.<br/><br/>Too true. One week I was selling 54 page Modest Medusa books at Stumptowns so fast that I ran out half way through the 1st day. The next weekend I was arguing with gamers at Sakuracon that the 54 page Panty Explosion and the 24 page G x B were actually real, full length playable games. Of course, not everyone we met at that show had this bias. A lot of people, especially interested non-gamers and frustrated former gamers were really into our small, compact games. I've always argued that those are my target customers anyway. <br/><br/>I've had great luck with Panty Explosion buttons and stickers, fair luck with shirts and novelty panties and no luck at all with miniatures (which we didn't really push that hard anyway). What I've learned is that people like to spend money, but they don't always want to spend money on a game, no matter how cool it looks. Handing them a button or a sticker (especially a sticker) helps them identify with your game. Nothing else may ever come of it, or they may buy your game next time they see you out of a sense of familiarity and loyalty. That really does work by the way. Ask any indie comic person that does a lot of comic shows. You always try to make sure that anyone who stops by your booth walks away with something free or cheap. At the next show they'll remember you, and they'll be way, way more likely to buy something from you because of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326403/#Comment_326403" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T18:35:46+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  6:35PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what this thread made me suddenly realize I want?

The last time I was at Gen Con, people went for the $1 buttons even when they didn't seem interested in the game. I imagine that 1" or 1.5" buttons would have worked even better than the 3" monsters that I was selling, since they're more fashionable.<br/><br/>I have a 3" button-maker though, so what else could I have done? (Read on...)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite><br/>Buttons take a bit of an initial investment (a proper button maker costs at least $100, often $300 or more), but make it easy to make money back if you can actually sell them as an impulse buy type thing. I could totally see using buttons as some kind of game components, whether very small ones serving as pawns or miniatures, or larger ones containing game material themselves.<br/></blockquote>\nI've been playing with the idea of buttons as game components, actually. What else is there that uses this idea? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_Men" rel="nofollow">Button Men</a>. As Wikipedia suggests, however, this is a dice game. Not a button game. How to integrate the buttons though... they can indicate abilities, goals, weaknesses, and the like. Placement is important. This implies a degree of tactics.<br/><br/>"All of the Missiles" is a collection of notebook scribbles right now, but it's shaping up into a game about giant robots and fashion -- a beer n' pretzels giant robot LARP. Inspirations include Fuzzy Heroes, The World Ends With You, and giant robots everywhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
