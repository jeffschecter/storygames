Trying to change that, so putting up what I've been working on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m currently running a Vampire the Masquerade LARP for a troupe that I joined about 15 years ago.  The rules for Mind\u2019s Eye Theatre LARP for V:tM were last published when Revised edition came out, quite some time ago, and they were rather rough, though they had been through a few revisions before.  It\u2019s hard to play for decades on broken rules and so last year a group of us who had each individually run our LARP at different times, along with my wife who is great at layout and editing, went about a process of revising those rules again and reassembling our rules.  Our goal was to make the game more fun and easier to play in literally every aspect of the game.  The scope of our project was so massive that we knew that it would require rewriting the book, which is what we did. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe spent about a half-year in total on the project, though much of the writing happened right at the end and some of the work was based on several years of experimentation with the Influence system to find something more competitive and easy to use for new players.  Our work yielded many, many changes and we are now in the process of both testing these changes and building upon them.  We\u2019ve been playing under these rules since the first of the year and this is a weekly game, so we have some idea of the effects of our changes at this point.  I\u2019d like to explain what we\u2019ve done, so that others who might be working in LARP rules might learn from our experiments.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off we realized that the challenge system (the core \u201cdice\u201d mechanic, using rock-paper-scissors) had some terminology problems.  We kept the basic game mechanic, but streamlined things, taking out what was unnecessary and making a standard layout for describing a challenge, such as \u201cContested Mental[Occult] vs. Physical[defense]\u201d.  We adapted a similar layout to powers to 4th edition D&amp;D, with an understandable stat block up top.  By having an easy to read and understand language for mechanics we found that a lot of the text disappeared from powers, making them easier to understand, and also allowing for more flexibility in power design.  We\u2019re finding that players understand the rules better now and that it\u2019s easy to put the basics of a power on a card.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made a great effort to create balance in the combat system.  This meant taking multiple actions out of the game, making Celerity more like it is in Requiem, and rebalancing the weapons section.  The Celerity change has been amazing in practice.  Our combat scenes are now very quick- an important thing in a LARP.  This has changed our play experience immeasurably.  We added an initiative system, which has made large group affairs run vastly more fairly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Skills section had an overhaul in the form of a separation of what you can do if you have the Skill and what you can do if you don\u2019t.  Each Skill has a list of suggested actions, with the same challenge lingo we use in powers, and with Difficulty ranges to help both players and Storytellers know what challenge levels are appropriate.  We also added a system for reducing difficulty on non-contested (static) challenges based on Skill level so that some tests don\u2019t even take a challenge if they\u2019re easy enough.<br/>\nWe redesigned feeding, so that players not only get to define how they feed, but so that they would have a choice as to how much blood they take when they feed, with consequences in terms of their Humanity.  This overhaul made the design for Ventrue clan disadvantages rather easy, and has improved the importance of the Herd Background.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisciplines were designed with the following goal: all power levels should be fun/cool.  We wanted players to be jealous of each other.  This led to a design style in which most powers have a thing they can do, rather than a mechanical modification.  Also certain Disciplines were modified for balance- Auspex was toned down, as was Thaumaturgy.  We removed power levels that were rarely used, such as Conditioning within Dominate, and wrote new powers which are more useful in LARP, such as a level of Presence which talks someone down from a frenzy easily.  We\u2019ve had mixed reviews of our Discipline changes, largely from players whose characters took Disciplines that were severely neutered in power level.  However as Storyteller I can tell you that Disciplines are far less game-breaking now, which is far better for the overall game atmosphere.  Politics are taking center stage now.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrenzy became more difficult to end, and we made it so that attempting to talk someone out of a frenzy makes you the target of the frenzy.  This has had hilarious results and interestingly political choices, in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Influence system in LARP Masquerade has always been both unique and interesting, but hard to get new players involved in and hard to make interestingly competitive.  Our fix has been long in the crafting- a territory based system, in which a grid map of the city holds influence in each square.  Being the vampire who controls that square means you get access to the influence within it.  Each territory has a primary influence and taking it requires a contest between the influence of the attacker and the influence of the defender, both scores added to the skill each character has in the skill most relevant to the influence.  So, if I\u2019m attacking a hospital territory, for control, the ST is comparing my Health Influence and Medicine Skill to my opponent\u2019s Health Influence and Medicine Skill.  If I have more I take the territory, and gain more influence.  There are different kinds of attacks, such as stealth and all-out (which gives a bonus, but requires a Humanity check).  This short-hand for the intrigue of influence peddling has opened up the Influence system to nearly all players.  We\u2019ve also added a Skill Use action, so that some players can spend the week working on a large project rather than tending to the mortal world.  The results of this system are dramatic.  Vampires now have something to fight over in a territorial way and bargain with as a currency.  You cannot imagine how important territory has become in our game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Backgrounds were changed a bit.  We\u2019ve removed the Fame background, but added a Status background similar to the one in Requiem.  We allow players to buy up to two points in any Influence, but to get higher than that they need to participate in the territory system.  We\u2019ve added our own Haven background, which allows players to pick a haven feature for each level they possess in the Background, such as \u201cEnviable Location\u201d, \u201cHigh Tech Security\u201d, or \u201cTraps and Monsters\u201d.  There\u2019s a long list, compiled from all the crazy stuff players normally ask for in their haven in a Vampire LARP.  This system is built to work with the communal havens that Sabbat, Tremere, and Nosferatu love so much, making those choices a double edged sword- highly efficient for points, but requiring trust.  We\u2019ve normalized the Resources background to compensate for weekly play and inflation adjusted the numbers, while including more examples of the kinds of things characters get at each level.  Generation was changed so that players no longer HAD to take it high to compete with each other.  Generation no longer is involved in Dominate and each point of Generation adds one to the maximum on traits and one to blood pool.  Easy to work with and calculate- no need for tables.  Willpower is no longer determined by Generation and 8th gens no longer get to spend 3 blood per turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe threw out Merits and particularly Flaws which were a problem in game and rewrote the remaining ones to make sure that they came up more.  We changed the point values for both, making Flaws and Merits both worth more.  This has had the effect that most players have between one and three Flaws, all of which are a central element of the character and which tend to come up in game often.  By increasing the value of Flaws, this has given the Storyteller license to totally mess with any given player over their Flaw, without much complaint.  People know what they\u2019re getting into and tend to pick iconic Flaws which they enjoy getting into the story of.  This is a major change, as flaws were once rather common and poorly enforced.  We find that many game plots now revolve around player Flaws.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\u2019ve added a new Merit category: Lifestyle Merits.  These merits are free, and come in two teirs: Major and Minor.  Each player may have only two Minor and one Major, at most, and the Major will require a specific Minor.  Each Lifestyle Merit represents the character living the life of a mortal in some respects, such as holding down a night job, roaming the streets as a gang-banger, or acting as a cult leader.  The Minor Lifestyles require two levels in a Skill and two levels in an Influence.  The Majors require five levels in an Influence and five levels in a Status background related to the Merit.  Each Lifestyle is associated with two of the sixteen Influences, and have requirements based on them.  So, for instance, the \u201cCriminal\u201d Minor Lifestyle Merit takes either two levels in Street Skill and two levels in Street Influence, or two levels in Intimidation Skill and two levels in Underworld Influence.  What these merits do is this: Minors give infinite use of level 1 Influence in the two influences associated with the merit and Majors give similar infinite use of level 3 influence.  All of this use is within reason of course.  Essentially characters place themselves in the setting gain access to influence as though they were the mortals they normally choose to control.  We find that players love this system, and I consider it one of the major successes of our overhaul.  In particular, Minor Lifestyle Merits are a hit, and make for ease of story and a level of realism players are really getting off on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest changes we made was to the clans.  Instead of just picking a clan and getting the clan advantages and disadvantages that come with it, players pick a clan and an age (Neonate, Ancilla, or Elder).  Each age has different clan advantages and disadvantages in each clan.  These are designed to disincentivize playing older characters, so that Neonate disadvantages are mild and Elder disadvantages are terrible, for instance.  This allowed us to really paint a picture with the clans, so that the Tremere really have a hierarchy system, with Neonates stuck in the chantry and Ancilla having their Background borrowed by the clan, for instance.  It has massively altered the age landscape of the game in a number of ways.  One- players are much less likely to play older characters, with Neonates now making up the bulk of our players, in a fairly realistic way.  Two- players tend to care about and know how old each other are.  This has made the traditional rule by primogeniture of the Camarilla thrive.  Ageism is everywhere and it\u2019s beautiful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall the changes are going well.  I\u2019d like to see more use of the Major Lifestyle merits, our Territory system is still not as dynamic as I\u2019d like, despite recent changes in this edition to encourage it, and some people have problems with some of our choices with the Disciplines.  I\u2019d like to see a larger weapon list and a martial arts system, but we\u2019re about to fix those things soon with a rules update after spring break.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if you have any questions, or have a burning desire to see the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope these walls of text are of interest or help to someone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ryan Chaddock                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317118/#Comment_317118" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T18:17:17+00:00" title="March 18, 2011  6:17PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, this sounds interesting.

Some of us might just each start small-run publishing RPGs now.  We have the bug and know we can do it.  We don't have a website for the LARP, we organize on a Facebook group.

I love Masquerade.<br/>\n<br/>\nJDCorley- I asked my players to come on here and comment, but they're, uh, busy I guess.  What I'm hearing from the players are as follows:  Fights are shorter, which is cool.  Fights are also fairer.  We allow each character one major action and 5 minor actions + Celerity level, and this system makes movement and actions much more understandable to players.  Some Disciplines which were ok before, are now awesome, such as Obfuscate which is very hard to break through now, or Dementation, which does lots more things than just turning people mad as a hatter.  Other Disciplines are not as good, such as Auspex and Thaumaturgy.  They still take those Disciplines though, so I see that as a vote of approval from some.  These comments are I think the natural products of rebalancing a rather difficult to balance power system.  Players say that Backgrounds are way more useful now and are buying lots of them.  They are also in love with the Lifestyle merit system (which we're about to expand).  They like what it does, and it gives them some guidance on what to take to accomplish a given concept.  They don't like that the Major Lifestyle Merits take 5 status to qualify for and that I won't let them take more than one level of Status a week, so it takes 5 weeks to get one.  I tend to write this off as impatience rather than a well thought-out criticism, but I might be wrong there.  To me, becoming essentially the master of two Influence areas should take a couple months at the least and I like players needing to make mid to long term XP investment decisions.  Maybe that's just the economics student in me.  The Age/Clan combo to determine clan traits has made players far more into their stories in some ways.  That decision (age and clan) is so big now that it colors a lot of the politics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ryanchaddock" title="ryanchaddock"><img alt="ryanchaddock" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ryanchaddock">ryanchaddock</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318089/#Comment_318089" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T15:48:33+00:00" title="March 29, 2011  3:48PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To elaborate on the clan/age decision, here's a scenario I've seen a few times.   A player is creating a character, has a clan in mind, starts looking at our new rules for advantages/disadvantages.  They say something like "I'd like to be a bit older.  Maybe embraced around the American Civil War."  I say: "At around 150 years old you'd be Ancilla.  Take a look at those rules."  At this point the player realizes just what age means to immortal beings.  Even playing a 150 year old jaded curmudgeon doesn't give them an automatic backstage pass to the respect an elder would receive.  If they want the prestige of being an elder in a game in which age really matters they have to play something even older and start looking at those terrible Elder disadvantages, like massive feeding penalties (Ventrue), humanity check penalties (Tremere), or impossible to talk-down frenzies (Brujah).  It's really fascinating seeing players do the roleplaying math on the opportunity costs involved, and then put together a playable character from all that juggling.  They often just pick Neonates if they can't handle the Elder disadvantages and I've seen this backfire as experienced players playing Neonates often overstep their age and get singled out by the harpies for being busted down a notch.  All good stuff for my game.  I love rules that lead to political SNAFUs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
