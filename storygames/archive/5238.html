So responses of "well Dogs doesn't do it that way" aren't going to be as helpful as "well you might consider using suits to do X instead".<br/><br/>So here goes: (face cards = 10; aces = 1 or 11)<br/><br/>1. Both players agree on a conflict and what their starting position will be.<br/>2. Each player draws X cards (based on stats) and places them in a line in front of them.<br/>3. Player A (the aggressor in the conflict) pushes forward two cards and narrates the action they wish to take.<br/>4. Player B must either "Give" (cede the conflict to the other player) or "See" by pushing forward one or more cards that total at least as much as the two cards that Player A pushed forward while narrating their response to the actions of Player A.<br/>4a. If Player B pushes one card forward, they are "Reversing the Blow".  This causes Player A to draw one card which stays face down and counts as "Harm" after the conflict (similar to Fallout).<br/>4b. If Player B pushes two cards forward, they "Block" or "Dodge".<br/>4c. If Player B must push three or more cards forward, they are "Taking the Blow" and must draw a face down Harm card for their side.<br/>5. Next Player B must either Give or push two cards forward (or one if it is their last card) to Raise.<br/>6. This goes back and forth until one player chooses to Give their side of the conflict.<br/>7. But there are ways of drawing additional cards in the conflict.<br/>7a. Either player may choose to draw additional cards during their turn, but each card comes at the cost of one additional Harm card for their side.<br/>7b. While a player Sees a Raise, they are able to draw one additional card for each time that the suit of the card(s) they are Seeing with matches the cards that were Raised with.  For example, if A Raises with a Ace of Clubs and a 7 of Hearts (total 18 points) and B Sees with an 8 of Diamonds and a 8 of Hearts, B would get to draw an additional card.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>-The suits came up when I was thinking about how cards are disadvantaged over polyhedral dice since the d4/d6/d8, etc. caused different effects in the game.  But choosing cards to push forward based not just on values but on suits as well added an interesting strategic element to the game.<br/>-This conflict resolution is pretty simple and off-the-cuff and doesn't account for character elements like traits, relationships or things.  But those could be addressed by letting players narrate in those things for additional cards.  The harder part would be how to delineate between a normal/big/troublesome element using cards.<br/>-I forgot until now about how Dogs progresses from Talking to Physical to Weapons to Guns.  But honestly, the conflicts we played were rich enough that I never missed it.  Also, the fiction that we were using didn't necessarily lend itself to people always carrying a gun at their side.<br/><br/>My wife isn't a role-player (so she says), but she humors me as I shanghai her into helping with my harebrained schemes.  We didn't have any characters and I just wanted to quickly test the rules, so I used a fiction we both understand (the TV show Alias).  And we did a few sample conflicts using some characters we know and love and threw together some really cool scenes using cards and these rules to break into a Russian missile base and steal some vital secret codes.  Like I said, she's not a role-player, but admitted that "this is a cool way to create a story".<br/><br/>Any thoughts on using cards in this way?  Any cool possibilities that I just flat out missed?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118199/#Comment_118199" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-06T18:19:20+00:00" title="January  6, 2008  6:19PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend of mine was working on what was effectively a Dogs hack with cards a few months back, though the design has moved on from that original concept.

My intent wasn't necessarily to try and emulate dice using cards, but you certainly came up with a cool solution!<br/><br/>James, I've been trying to concentrate on the one thing cards have that dice don't: suits.<br/><br/>So each player will accumulate "Harm" cards during the conflict which are drawn from the deck and sit face down next to them.  You get a Harm card when you draw an additional card to use in the conflict.  And you also give/take a Harm card when you reverse the blow or take the blow.<br/><br/>So at the end of the conflict, let's say that you have one Harm card and I have accumulated four of them.  They are flipped over, and each player looks at their cards separately and loses one stat point every time the suit of the stat they were using in the conflict comes up.<br/><br/>So if we were both using Hearts for that conflict, we might flip our Harm cards over and your one card is a Heart, and two of my four cards are Hearts.  So you would lose one point of your Hearts stat and I would lose two points.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not trying to completely emulate Dogs (so perhaps my subject line was ill-chosen).  I was trying to use the basic elements of the conflict resolution rules, port them to cards, and move in different directions to take advantages of the playing cards.<br/><br/>I was also thinking about having a suit assigned to each Trait, and those Trait values can go up and down in play.  The suit assigned to a Trait could be a trigger of when that Trait can be used in a conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
