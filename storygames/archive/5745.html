And I woke this morning from a dream:\n<ul>My boss, a couple of coworkers, and I pulled into a parking space in a strip mall in front of a game store. (None of these coworkers are active gamers in real life as far as I know. I suspect at least a couple of them probably played AD&amp;D back in high school. Though my boss definitely didn't and isn't.) It was 11:30 p.m. The hours posted on the door said they closed at 11:00 p.m., but it was brightly lit inside, the store owner was ringing up some guy at the register, and the door was unlocked, so we went in. It was a very clean store, with blonde wood display shelving, and pretty much everything was displayed face-out. There was a rotating wire counter stand with blister packs of unusual dice. One set that tempted me was labeled "averaging dice"; it was comprised of a swirly metallic gold d20 or d30 (a round-ish die) and a swirly metallic gold d3 or d5 that were specially numbered in some way, and intended to be rolled together. There was a rack of nice t-shirts with a consciously retro gamer aesthetic. I looked seriously at a goldenrod colored shirt with a reddish, iconic ouroboros-looking dragon silhouette silk-screened on it. There was a full-color, glossy-page, illustrated with wildly photoshopped photos (ala Immortal) RPG that was packaged in a three-ring binder. There was an RPG printed full text as a poster.<br/><br/>By the time I'd browsed the whole store, the place was hopping. There were a lot of customers, and folks were setting up to play games. Matt Forbeck was there. He held up the three-ring binder game and said, "I'm going to run it. Do you want to play?" But I had to decline. My coworkers were leaving, and I didn't have another ride home. And it was really late. Then I woke.</ul>\nAnd then in the shower this morning I realized the emotional context of the dream was pointing me at my first game store experience back in the late 70s. I'd purchased the D&amp;D boxed set at KayBee Toys. But my first real game store experience was a trip to Walt's Hobbies in Dearborn, MI.<br/><br/>In retrospect, it was pretty overwhelming. Racks of miniatures. Boxes of dice. Display units of painted miniatures and military models. And comic-style two-tier shelves of game upon game that I'd never heard of. Traveller, in the little black box. Metamorphosis Alpha. Empire of the Petal Throne. Arduin, in clear plastic zipper bags. AD&amp;D hardcovers.<br/><br/>And under it all was this sense of...cultural synergy (actually, it was almost cultural voyeurism). Folks had achieved these experiences of collaborative creation, and they were sharing them, and learning from each other. The games felt more like cultural artifacts than products.<br/><br/>I think that's what I'm looking for from a game. If I came to the Forge/IPR booth and found no new cultural artifacts of ambitious endeavors of play, I think I'd have exactly Judson's emotional reaction.<br/><br/>Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128512/#Comment_128512" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T09:17:47+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:17AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a threat of that happening, Paul?
