                    So I've not really been on this forum that long, despite Dev's patient suggestions that I join months ago. I'm very glad I did get back in the scene though, otherwise I wouldn't be immersed in such incredible ideas. Thank you all very much for being so cool. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyhoo, the recent discussion of awesome-o-fying Planescape and Spelljammer, combined with a recent viewing of Avatar Season 1 <i>and</i> the discussion of "key chains" and "making each other awesome," have had their effect on my brainmeats. It occured to me that a "make each other awesome" game could use "cues" as the basic attribute. As in, "this is your cue to be awesome in this way." <i>Best Friends</i>' character creation is a cool example of this in that you're explicitly telling another player that they're enviably awesome in some way.<br/><br/>So, I'm designing a little RPG where the players are on a pilgrimage. (I'll spare you the setting details.)
<blockquote><br/>While on pilgrimage, you are learning lessons about life from each step in the journey. However, you and your companions are also learning lessons from each other. During character creation, write down what it is you most want to learn from each of your companions.<br/><br/>    "I want to learn <b>courage in the face of adversity</b> from <i>Alex</i>."<br/>    "I want to learn to <b>be a better friend</b> from <i>Leslie</i>."<br/>    "I want to learn to <b>kick ass</b> from <i>Bill</i>."<br/></blockquote>
Some <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/485662.html?nc=9" rel="nofollow">further comments</a> on my LJ post suggested some more iterations of this basic concept:
<blockquote><br/><b>Ties to the world and scene-framing:</b><br/>I want to learn <b>compassion</b> from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plight of the Swamp Elves</span>.<br/><br/><b>Giving cues to other characters' relationships to each other:</b><br/>I want <i>Sachiko</i> to learn <b>Humility</b> from <i>Dawn</i>.<br/><br/><b>Combining the two:</b><br/>I want <i>Sachiko</i> to learn <b>Humility</b> from <i>Dawn</i> while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">baking cookies</span>.<br/></blockquote>
The nice part of this is that it provides cues for awesome-ness and a system of character growth in one sentence. It can also reinforce setting by providing a clear list of lessons that can be learned on a pilgrimage. (John Wick wisely advised at GenCon that a setting is at it's core, "what's important to the people in that culture.")<br/><br/>For example, if the pilgrimage were meant to teach the characters the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#The_Noble_Eightfold_Path" rel="nofollow">Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism</a>, you could limit the possible lessons to:
<blockquote><br/>   1. Right View - Realizing the Four Noble Truths <br/>   2. Right Intention - Commitment to mental and ethical growth in moderation <br/>   3. Right Speech - One speaks in a non hurtful, not exaggerated, truthful way <br/>   4. Right Action - Wholesome action, avoiding action that would hurt others <br/>   5. Right Livelihood - One's job does not harm in any way oneself or others; directly or indirectly <br/>   6. Right Effort - One makes an effort to improve <br/>   7. Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness <br/>   8. Right Concentration - State where one reaches enlightenment and the ego has disappeared <br/></blockquote>
And the statements would be stated thusly:
<blockquote><br/>"I want to learn <b>Right Mindfulness</b> from <i>Dev</i>."<br/>"I want <i>Dev</i> to learn <b>Right Action</b> from <i>Shreyas</i>."<br/>"I want to learn <b>Right Livelihood</b> from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Missing King in the City of Sands</span>."<br/></blockquote> </div>

                            Getting further into this system, I like the idea of using a limited set of possible lessons as a mechanical way of providing thematic focus for the setting. You could apply this to Star Trek lessons:

You could, of course, do a christian themed set of lessons based on the Ten Commandments, and the same goes for any belief system with conveniently listed mission statements.<br/><br/>Any other possible pop culture dissections?                        </div>

                            Oh yeah, that's an excellent source. I just realized that a military-themed set could also be created from the various honor codes, from Bushido to Green Lantern Oath to the Marines.

Good start. I'd make those <i>sub rosa</i>, though... meta-rules (known to players but not characters), and I'd make explicit in-setting rules, like:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.st-minutiae.com/academy/history316/general_orders.xhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.st-minutiae.com/academy/history316/general_orders.xhtml</a><br/><br/><b>General Order 7</b><br/>No Starfleet vessel shall visit the planet Talos IV under any circumstances, emergency or otherwise. This order supersedes General Order 6. Any transgression of this general order shall be punishable by death.

                            Chad, to your point... how about...<br/><br/>We admitted we were powerless and that our lives had become unmanageable. <br/>Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. <br/>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of that power. <br/>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. <br/>Admitted to the power and to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. <br/>Were entirely ready to have the power remove all these defects of character. <br/>Humbly asked the power to remove our shortcomings. <br/>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. <br/>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. <br/>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. <br/>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with the power, as we understood it, praying only for knowledge of its will for us and the power to carry that out. <br/>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to others, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br/><br/>Daniel, rocking idea, dude.                        </div>
