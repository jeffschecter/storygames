                    I was just thinking back upon my life of some 18 years' worth of gaming or so. I can't, for the life of me, recall a game where I had played in a normal setting, without:<br/><br/>Cool powers (supers, psychic, magic, unreal kung fu, etc)<br/>No cool powers, but definitely weird/unreal elements like Vampires, zombies, etc.<br/><br/>The closest I came was to suggesting a game of PTA where we were all people in the Lowrider community with various personal issues, but that's as close as I got.<br/><br/>Has anyone played a game of "regulars" in a "regular world"? I'll even allow in dramatic events (giant earthquakes, end of the world, historic events like ancient Rome, Greece, or 1800s... but without magic, lasers, etc) as "kosher", as long as no Cool Powerz are involved.<br/><br/>Just curious what people would use to play such a game?<br/><br/>Edit: I just remembered: Dust Devils.  I've run about 3 games of Dust Devils, each one without cool powerz and the like. That's as close as I've ever gotten to "real world gaming".                </div>

                            Had an Over the Edge game that ended before things got particularly weird.<br/>

Played some James Bond - a little wacky and cinematic, but not so over the top as, say, Feng Shui.  <br/>

All in all though, they're pretty thin upon the ground.<br/>

Run, yup.<br/>

I ran an Arabian Nights style setting where all the magic was hokum, fake, but the people believed.  When I set up the game, I intended to have magic appear in small doses, but after a couple of games, I told the group I was sorry to dissappoint, but I really thought the game might run better without it.  They agreed, and we really got into it.                        </div>

                            I did Top Secret when I was younger, and James Bond 007 both then and last year, plus a few theater-style larps which were purely mundane.  Plus Soap and PTA.  <br/>
<br/>
The Vinland campaign had magic, but it was mostly deniable.  That is, the magic consisted mostly of someone going into a trance to speak with the dead and then reporting what the dead said.  There were also three encounters with monsters (over a 52-session campaign).  <br/>
<br/>
But yeah, it's pretty uncommon.                        </div>

                            Well, both of my Dogs games have the 'deniable' flavor of demons -- are they real or figurative?  Doesn't matter, people are hurting.  That sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
I've played in lots of science fiction games; I've played in lots of historical games.  There was nothing 'strange' outside of being in a different setting than 1990s California and with different technology available.<br/>
<br/>
I played in a Mobsters game once.<br/>
<br/>
I actually played in online games where there were supernatural characters in the game, but they hid so well I never knowingly encountered them.  Does that count?  I mean, if you play Call of Cthulhu but you don't go into any dark basements or read any books... is it really Call of Cthulhu if Cthulhu doesn't Call?<br/>
<br/>
But Andy, are you looking for people who played a roleplaying game that didn't involve a "switch" (as defined in Breaking the Ice)?  I don't know if you'll find many of them.  That sort of thing is best played out in reality.                        </div>

No, switches are cool and all: I'm thinking your mob game and historical games are good examples of what I was looking for.<br/><br/>Eventually, I really want to try something out like Matt S's ideas for his little Americana project.  But I see three levels here:<br/><br/>*Games With Cool Powers* (Paranoia, D&amp;D, etc)<br/><br/>*Realistic-World Gaming* (mobsters, historical gaming)<br/><br/>*Real World Gaming* (Americana, "Peasant Quest", The Office, etc)  &lt;---- This is a place that I fear.  However, I want to really give it a shot sometime.<br/><br/>I figure that I have to engage in some good Realistic World gaming before I make the leap into Real World Gaming (like dipping a toe in the pool). Maybe.                        </div>

                            I've played a high-school melodrama a la <i>Breakfast Club</i>. It was actually probably the 3 most fun sessions out of 2 years of weekly gaming with that particular group. That same group also played out a road-trip movie game using a variant on the <i>Dogs</i> dice mechanics that was pretty good, too, but I'm not entirely sure there wasn't some weirdness in that one - I never SAW the capybara ranch, but we heard about it, and the mutant Eagles fans in the abandoned radium-mining town were pretty odd.                        </div>

                            A few, actually. One of my long-running groups (which rotated GMship and titles) had a guy in it who ran a game ostensibly based on the comic <i>Strangers in Paradise</i>, but which was really Angst in Paradise.  Everyone was normal, powers-wise, but it was also like a Rorschach inkblot for all involved.  <br/><br/>I ran a horror/survival game that occured after a nuclear war - the characters were mutants, but not the spiffy kind.                        </div>

                            I've played Dust Devils -- no magic or anything. Cowboys are cool, but we mostly played hookers and drunks. <br/><br/>I've also played Dogs in a demons are deniable mode. As I'm also LDS I suppose you could count this as "no things that don't exist in the real world" if you wanted to push the issue. <br/><br/>Then there is Breaking the Ice, which I've never seriously considered playing with cool powers. <br/><br/>James Bond I am personally not going to count, even though I've played it, because for me it falls into the "metanormals" mode. Its based semi-losely on reality, sure, but the super-spy with gizmos goes beyond the pale. It certainly isn't "funky powers" but it also isn't "real world gaming" and is only vaugely "realistic world gaming." <br/><br/>I've also played lots of games in which we were normal folk in worlds with magic -- all White Hats in Buffy style games. But I'm not sure those count either. <br/><br/>In another thread I talked about playing games in which there were no "metanormals" as a mode of breaking myself of old habits towards game. One of the reasons for that is that it forces me to, as Christian says, focus on the drama and human interaction. <br/><br/>I don't think that its accidental that as we get into games that actually allow you to reliably make human interaction and social drama a mechanically supported part of the game we're starting to get more games that have less supernatural aspecting. Not because they're better, but simply because the new structures let us explore things that would have been hard before.<br/><br/>So Andy, I don't know if realistic world gaming will help you get to real world gaming. A good system would probably do a lot more than a gradual stepping in. I mean, I could be totally full of shit on this one -- but it worked for me, and I suspect it may be one of those "you can't sneak up on mode" issues.                        </div>

                            I'm drawn to the mundane and I think I've played/run more than my share of games like this.  Low-tech GURPS, no magic, no monsters, that sort of thing, was a staple for a long time.  <br/><br/>Now I'm super interested in designing a game that hits that uncomfortable spot for you, Andy - like a game about Best Buy employees or something, with absolutely nothing extraordinary about them in the kewl powerz sense.  Every time I bring this up people sort of recoil in horror, which I think is telling.                        </div>

                            I ran a Heroquest game in the vein of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, with each character being siblings with a claim to the throne after the death of their father. Common magic was limited to nonmagical talents and everyone's keywords were mundane (alchemist / sage was as strange as it got). Turned out great. So I'm betting a lot of systems can be used for games like this even though they normally aren't.<br/><br/>Lots of games centered on gangsters and spies, genres which seem to keep out the kewl powers.<br/><br/>I'm interested to see if people <i>really</i> want real world gaming. I'm guessing most don't. Which bodes ill for my current projects <i>Today</i> (playing people in pain on the day they must beat it or break down) and <i>The Big House</i> (prison drama); both have a lack of powers and weird elements.                        </div>

                            Actually I kind of want "real world" gaming, at least for a change.<br/>
<br/>
In November, we played a PTA game set in a fictional version of Serbia circa 1991; I played a single mother worried about her child.  Granted it was a setting fraught with conflict, but there wasn't anything implausible about it, and my character's problems were fairly everyday things.  I think that my character's "ordinary-ness" helped ground the rest of the game, and also provided some thematic resonance to what we were doing.<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, I think role-playing games are similar to comic books: they're self-confined to a single genre (in this case, "adventurers" with freaky abilities).  The medium is potentially far wider than that, and capable of doing so much more.                        </div>

                            Good to hear some agreement, Jason and James. And the comic book analogy is very apt. <br/><br/>Embracing real world play to some extent strips away escapism as a motive for play, presumably allowing us to focus on other things instead. What I'm wondering, though, is how to avoid the problem that Ron brought up on The Forge in discussing <i>Today</i>: <br/><br/><i>This is raw agony, full of exposed-nerve humanity. However, that's difficult subject matter for fiction. I think audiences, me included, have a threshold of pain-content, per character, beyond which they classify the character into either "victim" or "loser." In either case, the character is no longer considered seriously as a decision-maker, but is now an object to be moved around or to be utilized by some other, decision-making character. It's terribly unfair, but I think it's a given feature of personal/audience behavior.</i><br/><br/>Having kewl powerz insulates a character against this effect. What can a real life RPG use to prevent players from losing interest in the character as a valid protagonist while still creating dificult, painful conflicts? <br/><br/>Maybe we need another thread on this?                        </div>

                            I don't know if it is going to work or not, but my next project is called Grey Ranks and it has to address this hard-core.  Your characters are <em>fucked</em>, you know this going in, and everything you hold dear is going to be taken from you and smashed.  That's the game.  But at the same time you are falling in love, and that's a powerful force for good, and really your only hope of survival at all.  So you've got a character who is tragic, and is going to fail, but you have the opportunity to make that failure have meaning, and to do good things on the way.  That's the "in" for the player (well, that and killing Nazis), because you want those connections, and the character can't really remain a pawn if you are invested in their emotional universe.  That's my hope, anyway.  Also, all that falling in love is happening among player characters exclusively, which should crank it up a bit.                        </div>

                            Like everyone else, I've done it with Dogs, Dust Devils, PTA (ancient rome), and Universalis (high school, western, detective story).<br/>
<br/>
I 've also played Pirates (an obscure indie game), and, very strangely, a HERO system game in which the players based the characters on themselves.<br/>
<br/>
PTA is my go-to game for everything these days, so if I was going to play something like Clerks or Friends or even The Bourne Identity, I'd use that.<br/>
<br/>
For The Office, though, I kind of want to use Great Ork Gods.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I also have this back-burner project for Sorcerer called "The Company" that is entirely real-world based. The PCs are CIA agents and the demons are real people that are used by the agents to achieve their goals.                        </div>

I've played in a PTA game about (modern day) gamers that was totally mundane.<br>

I've played in a WoD game that was just gypsies in a van, with no actual vampires or anything out there and the gypsies didn't have any more supernatural powers than actual gypsies would.<br>

Oh, and Breaking the Ice, although that was set in a Logan's Run-type setting, so it wasn't realistic at all, but we didn't have any special powers (we did, however, have awesome jumpsuits).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Y'know, I have another theory about the import of special powers.</p>
<p>If I see a real-world story (like, say, an <em>Pump Up the Volume</em>]) in which the bad guy is discovered in the end, the good guy is celebrated, and an important moral victory is established ... I find it hard to believe.  I distance myself from it, in that moment.  I say "Ah ... they were lying to me.  This movie isn't actually about the real world."</p>
<p>And I do <em>not</em> consider myself a cynic.  I'm a firm believer in the ascendancy of hope, of justice, of good over evil.  I think that's the nature of the real world.</p>
<p>But my experience is that, in the real world, hopes and dreams get stepped on.  They get crushed, and battered, and bent.  Their strength isn't in a rousing finale and a happy ending, it's in standing up and going on.  Hope has a quiet, sad, uncathartic kind of strength.  It makes for quiet, sad, uncathartic kinds of stories.</p>
<p>So here's my theory:  The wacko powers, the secret agents who never get shot (no matter how many bullets fly their way), the fantasy kingdoms and all that are a flag.  They are "Once upon a time, a long way from here."  They let you say "This is a story of a world that produces rousing stories with a big finish ... not the world you know."</p>

                            Well, there are a lot of ways to set fiction in the real world (i.e. no monsters or special powers) without setting up the expectation that it will be realistic and in a naturalistic genre.  Fiction does this all the time: slapstick comedies, soap opera, action movies, and so forth.  In other words, "no special powers" doesn't mean "playing Joe Average living through an ordinary day".  It can mean playing millionaires, kings, daring spies, brilliant detectives, and so forth.                        </div>

<br/>
I like your point, but I'd also like to point out that the main character in <i>Pump Up the Volume</i> does in fact get arrested at the end of the film, and in all likelihood he goes off the air.  The bit about the principal getting caught is schmaltzy, though.                        </div>

                            PTA: Quicksilver was a story about running an illegal substance, though we never clarified what it was. The game was about the relationships of the characters to each other (because that's what PTA does), complete with tangled, spiteful nastiness between the characters who loved each other.<br/>

If someone ever plays a game of Shock: without extraordinary circumstances, either they're brilliant or they're breaking the rules.<br/>
<br/>
... which, I guess, brings me to a point:<br/>
<br/>
if you make a game about what you care about Ã¢â‚¬â€ personally, societally Ã¢â‚¬â€ then use ghosts, magic, superpowers, and spy gadgets to address them, that's cool. You're writing a game Poe would like. If you're making a game about the powers and have to shoehorn in the stuff you care about, that makes an ass game.                        </div>

                            I ran an extended game that had the characters leading their personal lives and taking on organized crime. I played in one that essentially had the players make ordinary guys (who were not all that ordinary but were not paranormal) and the game was just rounds of mini-scenarios run for each character, some of whom never met (although the GM did try to get us together).<br>
<br>
Both of these were very fun and very character-focused (the entire story was essentially tailored to the PC). Both of them used the copious amounts of free time available to high school students.<br>
