You can read their blurb here:<br/><a href="http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page1/page1.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page1/page1.html</a><br/><br/>Obviously, I could poke around at the yahoo group and dig up various people's suggestions there. And I'm starting to sort through the group.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, it seems like Mythic will be able to handle many of the "duties" of a GM. But, I'm curious to hear from folks that have tried doing something sort of like this, only without having the benefit (?) of Mythic. "This" being: a traditional rpg, and 2 people playing, with neither of them being a "GM". My wife isn't comfortable (or really interested) in running a game, so it seemed to me like a perfect opportunity to try out Mythic (which I picked up a while ago) as well as mess around with Secret of Zir'An.<br/><br/>I'm comfortable running games, and I've done a fair amount of one-on-one play for my wife, with me as the GM. While we both enjoy it, I decided I'd like to actually be able to _play_ with some of the games that I've got. As the group that I run stuff for is a White Wolf/d20 only group, it doesn't leave me much choice.<br/><br/>The core system of SoZ seems a bit fiddly to me, but I tend to like lighter systems these days; Zorcerer of Zo is my "go to" game. My wife likes the fiddly stuff more, so I figure we'll go ahead and try the default system for a while. At some point I plan on using Spirit of the Century to power SoZ for a while. Depending on how the core system of SoZ plays out, the switch to trying SotC might happen sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>What sort of pitfalls might I expect in playing a traditional game, where my wife and I are sharing the same amount of control of the world and game? I realize that the both of us are going to want to be on the same page as far as game expectations, but after that things get a bit hazier for me.<br/><br/>In case anyone is wondering why SoZ (and SotC) instead of something else... I've got a large number of games. So many in fact, that I've sworn off buying anything until Jan/Feb 09. In part it's because I wanted to try and actually _do_ something with all the stuff I've got. I narrowed down the choices to: Monsters and Other Childish Things, Talislanta, Cat, and Secret of Zir'An. My wife made the final pick. For a while it looked like it was going to be Talislanta, but since I've been running a fantasy game for a while (almost a year now?) she decided she wanted something different.<br/><br/>And she likes the idea of being a pirate. Airship pirate is a strong possibility.<br/><br/>SoZ is a nifty enough setting, and I've wanted a chance to take it out for a spin. Plus, I've been wanting to try out Spirit of the Century. Since SoZ is kind of a blend of Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow mixed with Fantasy Setting, it seems like an easy enough fit with SotC.<br/><br/>Any suggestions? Any other folks with actual experience doing something like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146941/#Comment_146941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T17:24:08+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  5:24PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been running a solo game using the <i>Mythic GME</i> and <i>Mythic Variations</i> to drive a superhero story running under the <i>Truth &amp; Justice PDQ</i> rules.  So far, it's been a blast.  (If you dig through the RPG.net archives, you'll probably find a couple of threads about <i>Mythic</i> where I have posted about the game).<br/><br/>I recommend using <i>Mythic Variations</i> as well as the basic <i>Mythic GME</i>, it adds several useful ideas.<br/><br/>The coolest thing about <i>Mythic</i> is that, even though I'm the only one playing, so ultimately I <i>must be</i> the source of all the ideas and themes of the game, the unfolding plotline still manages to surprise me.  <i>Mythic</i> provides 'kick in the head' sorts of inspiration that drive the story in different directions than the players might originally intend.  It works kind of like <i>IaWA</i>'s Oracles, by handing the player or players random input, and asking them to use their logical and pattern-finding skills to build that input into the ongoing story.<br/><br/>In my game, I never saw the romantic triangle subplot coming -- but <i>Mythic</i> provided the input to look at the established situation in that light, and then I said "Of course!  That explains why he's acting that way!" and it became a thread in the story.  Likewise, the opening action scene turned out to be more like a framing device in the imaginary comic:  The subsequent interrupt scene developing another plot thread ran away with the story for the rest of the first issue.  That was cool, and made me believe that <i>Mythic</i> really can do what it says.<br/><br/>Good luck with your <i>Zir'An</i> game!  I'll be interested in hearing how it works out.  I've been curious about <i>Zir'An</i> for a while, but haven't been (quite) willing to spend the money.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
