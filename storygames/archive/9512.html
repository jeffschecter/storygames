I only have a few I think, at least that I can think of right now. I think it's because over the last few years I've made others come true (namely a Solid weekly gaming group who are into these story-ish games, etc).<br/><br/><b>Gaming Goals:<br/></b><br/>* Play more, GM less. Encourage my friends to step up.<br/>* Write at least two small fan-supplements (of about 10 pages, etc) for other RPGs or games that I like (that I DIDN'T design): This could be a replay of my own game, campaign notes sorted into a transferrable form (like the non-rules parts of Lady Blackbird), etc.<br/>* Run an epic <b>Hellas</b> game every other weekend or so, lasting at least a year. Like Final Fantasy epic-ness but on the tabletop.<br/>* Then do the same, but with <b>Vampire: Requiem</b> (note, the Hellas game I want to run, this one I'd be content to run or play).<br/>* Translate <b>Sword World 2.0</b> into English just enough in order for it to be playable, then play it. A lot. A year later: Alshard. These games are *my* <b>D&amp;D 4e</b>'s.<br/>* Play another game of Tenra Bansho where someone else is running it for me.<br/>* Play a campaign of <b>D&amp;D 4e</b> set in a non-standard setting, which is Epic, and yet only goes from levels 1-10 (possibly 11, tops).<br/>* Play something dark and horrific. I'm thinking either The End (d20 Lost Souls), Conspiracy of Shadows (when it's capital D-Done), or Kult.<br/>* Play or run a fantasy game where, like Shock, everyone at the table owns a facet of the world and is encouraged to create stuff for that element.<br/><br/><b>Goals that are related to a sub-hobby of Gaming, the Production/Design of Games:</b><br/><br/>* Learn inDesign enough to make decent-looking works. MS Word is solid, but what I want to do only InDesign can provide... but making that leap is a chasm-like leap.<br/>* Produce a second Story Games Names Book, this one with names, settings and situations.<br/>* Find some setting inspiration on a game I've been working on for a while (one that stalled due to setting issues), and finish crafting it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210978/#Comment_210978" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T15:53:45+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  3:53PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dream Goals:<br/><br/>Play games that teach me new things and fruitfully require me to do things differently than I would if I were in charge.
