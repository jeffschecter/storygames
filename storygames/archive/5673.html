They come from disparate backgrounds and have questionable skills.  But they are all looking for a way out of the Barbary Coast.  I want the character generation to feel like answering a series of questions and bring in as much feel and slang as possible.  I'm looking for the relatively open-ended feel of a game like Dust Devils or Contenders, where anything is possible given the constraints of the genre.  It's also important for the characters to have direct links to other PCs and NPCs to make each scene matter.  The Barbary Coast was a lot of people in what was then a small city, and I want the feel of "everybody knows everybody".<br/><br/>Take a look at the sample character below and tell me what else you want to know about this character.  I can work just about anything into the mechanics, but I would like some suggestions to help make these characters come alive!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>What\u2019s your name?<br/><br/>\u2022\tKelly O\u2019Malley<br/><br/>What do people call you?<br/><br/>\u2022\tShanghai Kelly<br/><br/>What are your marks?<br/><br/>\u2022\tFists: 4<br/>\u2022\tWits: 2<br/>\u2022\tGuts: 4<br/>\u2022\tCharms: 3 <br/><br/>Where do you come from?<br/><br/>\u2022\tIreland<br/><br/>What do you do?<br/><br/>\u2022\tFight<br/><br/>Who do you know?<br/><br/>\u2022\tChin Poy, leader of the Sue Yop Tong<br/>\u2022\tBig Bertha, the Madam of Montgomery Street<br/>\u2022\tSamuel Tetlow, local politician on the take<br/><br/>Where is your hangout?<br/><br/>\u2022\tThe Loose Rafters, a bar off Portsmouth Square<br/><br/>How are you going to get out?<br/><br/>\u2022\tMake enough money to buy a ship and sail to Vancouver.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127067/#Comment_127067" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-16T16:01:10+00:00" title="February 16, 2008  4:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2008 4:05PM by Johnstone.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why is Shanghai Kelly broke?<br/><br/>Did he* get robbed on arrival?

One scene they may be helping you, and another scene they will be pushing you back in the gutter.<br/><br/>I think also keeping real names might be preferable to me than referring to a faceless "gang".  Only because I want to keep things personal and because each PC is required to have a connection to at least one other PC.  I wanted to create a bit of a loose network of malcontents who appear in multiple scenes and change alliance almost as often.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I had an idea this morning for currency to use in the game:<br/><br/>Gold (use green or gold colored tokens if you have them)<br/>-For opportunities<br/>-Use Gold to get ahead in a conflict<br/>-As Gold increases, a character has more options, but also more people who want to get at that Gold.<br/><br/>Gutter (use black or brown colored tokens if they are available)<br/>-Cause the character to sink deeper into depravity<br/>-Get rid of Gutter points by sacrificing for an ideal.<br/>-As Gutter increases, reputation suffers, but the character can get away with more as well.<br/><br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127159/#Comment_127159" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-17T11:06:21+00:00" title="February 17, 2008 11:06AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to stress the nebulous nature of those relationships, you might want to consider putting that into char-gen.<br/><br/>For each person you know:<br/><br/>"What do they owe you?"<br/>"What do you owe them?"<br/><br/>or another way:<br/><br/>"Why do you know them?"<br/>"Why do they know you?"<br/><br/>or even just:<br/><br/>"What do they want?"<br/><br/>which can be used to drive whether the character is supporting or opposing the player's character.<br/><br/>I want to call Gold "Glitter" so that I can have "Glitter vs. Gutter."

I love it!!  But also a great excuse to "get the characters" together, if only temporary.  They say prison is a school for criminals...and what better way to meet your classmates!<br/><br/>Thinking with my practical-at-the-table hat on, I wonder whether it might need a _little_ more structure.  Certainly the GM and perhaps one or more of the players would need to be taking notes.  And the players would need to feel comfortable and empowered enough that the things they said in a conversation would be getting turned into "law" on their character sheet.  Rather than the opposite approach of the players creating their characters in a vacuum and then discussing at the table.<br/><br/>Perhaps the GM could be a good facilitator here to ask questions and start conversations.<br/><br/>GM: "OK, enough about why you are here.  Why do you all want to get out?  Not just out of jail, but out of the Barbary Coast?  What's the brass ring?"<br/><br/>PLAYER A: "Yeah, O'Malley.  You got a pretty decent left hook.  Why not keep fighting to keep yourself in drink?"<br/><br/>PLAYER B: "May be, but there's a place in Vancouver I heard about where the weather's fine and the women are finer.  I'm gonna get enough of a grubstake to get a small ship and sail it right up the coast!

So if, in conversation, I say your character O'Malley has gambling debts, that becomes part of your guy's backstory, and you add it somewhere - maybe under "Why do I want to get out?" or maybe under "Who is my enemy?"<br/><br/>Under this scheme, the scene would continue until everybody had a fleshed-out character in front of them.  Maybe there are five questions and everybody answers four.  Personally I wouldn't worry about ownership issues at all, but if it is a concern, add some kind of veto:  "No, you heard wrong, buddy.  It's Kowalski who owes <i>me</i>."  You'd want to limit this because, ultimately, it's lame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
