To that end I've read the book (well most of it, well the parts on how to run the game, I like to make up my own monsters) and ran two game sessions.<br/><br/>Over all I say bravo to the creators. The rules work and I was able to figure out how to run it based on the written material rather than by playing it. <br/><br/>I'll be banging up my own copy of the book tomorrow so I have it as a reference for the show. I appreciate the TXT version since that makes the book lay out so much easier. For the most part though I'm pretty sure I won't need it at all. Clearly the action is on the character sheets and GM sheet.<br/><br/>When I first read it and in the first play session I was wondering how the whole thing worked and what the feel of the game is. As with most rules they say read everything and follow the rules which most of us don't do and which honestly aren't needed. Can't say how many D+D rules I've ignored over the years. What I came away with was that it is suppose to be a conversation and that the moves are the skeleton on which the conversation lives. In the first session this translated into a clunky halting play session with me frequently posing chose this or that challenges to the player. This is not what the examples called for but with the GM section it spends more time with principles than playing advice (mind you that is very deceptive because the GM moves do a wonderful job in codifying what good GMs do instinctively).<br/><br/>What made the game click for me was the time spent between the play sessions thinking about what happened. <br/><br/>I'm a very experienced GM with over 35 years experience. I think I'm pretty good and the version of D+D I run is already a conversation punctuated by occasional rolls (mainly based on player stats). As the day's percolated, the though crystalized that what DW does is codify good GM experience and that one of those learnings is that rules mechanically and boringly applied kill the flow of conversation and thus kill games. Stopping to mechanically discuss stakes for example would kill the mood. It is when the GM asks a question or tells them a dilemma that energy flows. So DW really relies on a skilled good GM - just like so many RPGs.<br/><br/>The second session worked so much more smoothly because I started ignoring the mechanical aspect of the game and focus on just running a D+D game. The difference was wonderful. The moves resolution system leaves a light footprint on play and the partial success allows the GM to put meat on costs. I lived not rolling dice. That way I didn't have to kill players accidentally. I could pick at them and raise tension by the small but inevitable build up of damage. After the session and looked back at the GM moves and saw how I'd used many of them and how I've used moves like this for decades. The result was I feel very comfortable with running this game. <br/><br/>I wonder if it teaches new GMs to be good GMs? It really could because it does codify good game play in a way that most RPGs NEVER do. <br/><br/>What are your impressions of the game and how you learned to run it? Did you play before you ran it or learn it by reading?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414771/#Comment_414771" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T02:19:27+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  2:19AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I see most of the GMing advice as coming from AW.

I think it radically changed the way I view the role. I hope it's made me better. However the most disturbing change, for me, has been in the way I now read books or view media - now I see some plot development and a voice in my head goes "that's announcing future badness" or "separate them" or somesuch.

I played DW in early version a few times before I tried my hand running it. It was a bumpy ride to start but now I doubt I'd have much fun playing other version of fantasy RPGs I grew up with. If I want to do a dungeon crawl, I'm going to reach for World of Dungeons and if I want to do a fantasy story RPG, I'm going to reach for Dungeon World. Other systems are all well and good - not arguing against them in any way - just found what suits me and my style.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414802/#Comment_414802" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T18:18:37+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  6:18PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2013 12:51PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure I've read a thread where either Vincent or ...

I certainly see them in good D+D GMing but they could come straight from literature or just thinking about it. <br/><br/>One thing I do notice is that DW GMs are VERY powerful! They don't roll dice (which I love BTW) but just deal out consequences. They don't want to kill the players but oh can they soooo do it. The GM is like a puppet master pulling the strings. They are doing it benevolently but this is just completely opposite of a GMless game. Tasks and power are not shared equally. <br/><br/>When I first started at the Forge I thought my GMing style seemed a bit like railroading. I knew what the players would encounter next. Their actions influenced things but if I needed them to be captured I could do it. I pulled the strings as needed to move from critical moment to critical moment rather than getting caught in the minutia of combat. Now I see that on the one hand I was doing what the do in Gumshoe - you will get all the clues - and the World games - I will make things happen by GM moves. Which leaves me wondering what railroading really is? Maybe it is looking like you are controlling the players - I always gave the illusion of player control. Perhaps the power sharing that is in story games in general mitigates full on railroading because player get to contribute so much. <br/><br/>BTW the second link didn't work when I clicked it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414817/#Comment_414817" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T06:25:09+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  6:25AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking a bit about your comment Chris ( matrixgamer), one of the things I think I see creeping back in quietly with DW and some other post-Forge games is an unspoken re-examination of the idea of GM-as-Entertainer.<br/><br/>And man, for a while that concept was really poo-poo'ed.<br/><br/>Not without reason. Folks who were railing against GM-as-Entertainer were looking around at the methods being used and encouraged by the mid 90s and folks were having UnFun in big dollops.<br/><br/>I think a few things came out of those complaints that have turned out to be good:<br/>1) Players as entertainers also<br/>I think dirty hippy games tend to encourage this concept, even when you have the more classic GM+Character Players set up mechanically. I think there's more awareness that successful fun doesn't come strictly by playing only your own character especially if it harms the group fun or fun of other individual character players.<br/><br/>2) Designer as Entertainer<br/>Focused design, getting more directly towards what characters are trying to do and jumping down into the situation more quickly has come about, at least in dirty hippy circles. If a designer wants to write something that is focused on feuding, snarky family members trying to get one up on each other at a Renaissance dinner party, they just plain write that. They no longer feel the first step is to write a big-ass tome all about the renaissance era, and only then go write an adventure about the dinner party. Just jump to the fricking chase. And yes, it's okay to be pretty straight forward and revealing about what is going on in a game and what the concept is at hand.<br/><br/>3) GM as Entertainer techniques have changed<br/>People examined things that did work and have formalized them more, taking them out of the realm of easily ignored advice sections. DW seems like a classic in that regard. I know you've seen me rant about games that don't do this formalization, and rely on players simply picking it up by osmosis or assume certain types of things are "common sense" when they're only common sense to people already in the play culture that produced the game in the first place (Howard Whitehouse's older game texts, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414818/#Comment_414818" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T07:25:04+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  7:25AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread, Chris!<br/><br/>I just started a new AW game with my group, and the last game we played was DW, so this is right where my thinking is. <br/><br/>+1 to Robb's point, though, that this stuff all really comes from AW, not DW.

That was what I tried to do with the new GM agendas and principles for the Planarch Codex too. It's not expected that you'll do everything properly the first time -- that you'll remember all the agendas and principles and always says, and that you'll make the full variety of moves. Instead, I think the game expects you to be increasingly self-aware about what you do when you GM (partially because you can focus on it, since you don't have heavy GM-side mechanics to engage with or dice to roll) and to be more intentional about it over time, bringing in new moves or principles from AW or DW (or the Planarch Codex) as they make sense, as the game may ask you to do some things that aren't familiar to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414837/#Comment_414837" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T11:30:54+00:00" title="May 28, 2013 11:30AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Which leaves me wondering what railroading really is?

So if you're really letting the GMing principles guide you, you won't be railroading.<br/><br/>Draw maps, leave blanks - If you leave blanks to be filled in during play, you'll fill them in with things that are responses to what the players are doing. This is pretty much the exact opposite of railroading, where you have planned out what is going to happen in detail before you start playing. Yes you prep some things and you exploit your prep, but you don't plan everything before getting to the table.<br/><br/>Make a move that follows - Again, you respond to what is happening in play rather than focusing on referencing your prep and adjudicating it.<br/><br/>Ask questions and use the answers - Again, don't prep everything. Instead, leave blanks. And let the players help fill in some of the blanks.<br/><br/>Be a fan of the characters - Under this it says "You\u2019re not here to push them in any particular direction, merely to participate in fiction that features them and their action." That's pretty anti-railroading right there.<br/><br/>In my mind, the principles are not just for the GM. They are there for the players as well, to serve as a springboard for a healthy conversation about expectations. If you are signing on to play a game of DW, you have reasonable reason to expect that the GM will be following these principles. If you feel they are not, then the principles serve as a way to facilitate a talk about it.<br/><br/>The principles are not just advice. They're not just tips and tricks. They are procedure and method for filling the GM role. They are the rules for how to GM. That's one of the most important things about *World games - the way they give GMs rules, and how those rules drive actual play.<br/><br/>I actually completely disagree that DW needs a "skilled GM". What it needs is a GM willing to embrace and utilize the agenda, principles, and moves. Sure, you'll gain proficiency with that after initially struggling and needing to reference them more often - the same way players traditionally gain more system mastery with other RPGs. But I think the GM rules lay down a reasonably clear path to follow, as much as such a path can be made clear.<br/><br/>I look at the principles like zen sutra. They are short crystalizations of profound thought. They are worthy of repeated study - the more you go back and look at them, the more you see there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414839/#Comment_414839" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T11:50:53+00:00" title="May 28, 2013 11:50AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 to everything Rob says, especially this:\n<blockquote>They are worthy of repeated study - the more you go back and look at them, the more you see there.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414842/#Comment_414842" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T13:04:16+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  1:04PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Is there more of an edgy writing style to the rules in AW?

The principles ("play to find out") and the structure of the game itself all conspire to put a lot more agency into the hands of the players than in a traditional RPG as you're describing it.<br/><br/>In AW, this is very explicit: for example, there's no real way to "bullet-proof" your NPCs, so they are all vulnerable to PC actions and attacks. Arranging something like "you are captured" is very difficult when the PCs have access to moves which can easily kill them, seduce them, escape them (e.g. "eye on the door"), or worse (e.g. "Frenzy"). Even if the MC isn't following her principles, she'll find it pretty hard to stick to that sequence of events. But, of course, she shouldn't even be trying, if she's playing by the book: she should be playing to find out, instead.<br/><br/>I wonder if this effect is as strong in DW, where NPCs and monsters <i>do</i> have stats. I suspect this is why the book has such explicit guidelines for monster creation, for example: it's a message to the DM/MC not to, for instance, slap on some ridiculous armor numbers to that NPC she hopes won't get killed, just on a whim.<br/><br/>Asking questions and using player input should also mean that the MC can't easily prep "near brush with Vader", but, instead, would ask the player what their father is like, and why they're afraid of him. This changes the context of that interaction, because, what if, based on the player's answers, instead of a "near brush", some kind of romantic dinner seems more appropriate?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414857/#Comment_414857" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T15:09:33+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  3:09PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2013 3:23PM by Cneph.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, not wanting to fan any flames here- I'm not sure whether you're saying that's how you run DW/AW games- but looking at how you laid out Star Wars, though you may have had blanks on some specifics you've still (pre)determined that:<br/>A. the characters will meet the contact in the flesh, and be captured (no matter what they do?) <br/>B. they will escape in a manner that means there will be a chase (as opposed to maybe sneaking onto a shuttle and flying out casually with an older code that still checks out), and <br/>C. they don't blow up or cripple Vaders' Star Destroyer in the process.<br/><br/>So depending how closely you hold to that preplanned series of events, I could consider that railroading.<br/>The difference with *W games might be that you know Vader is in the system hunting the party Jedi (a Front/Doom/Threat etc), you know there is a strike team coming if they meet with their contact in person, you've some ideas for where they will be taken if they are captured, but also maybe you think about what the area around the spaceport is like for a chase scene as they escape the squad and try to get back to their ship.<br/><br/>(Crossposted with Paul_T, he makes good points)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414858/#Comment_414858" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T16:07:36+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  4:07PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul and Cneph say good things.

It was a low prep but definitely a straight line game so the railroading tag is totally fair. A better example of a leave blanks game would be a Call of Cthulhu game I ran fifteen years ago. In this game we started each play session with players making arguments (ala Matrix games) about weird stuff their family and friends told them. I then built the monsters from this and heavily followed the leads they gave me. Had my input as well, toying with the players, and we didn't use too many of the game rules (mainly research and spot hidden, plus sanity rolls as needed. So it was more a conversation. <br/><br/>The skill that this approach needs is not just knowing the rules but being comfortable and natural giving up control and jiving with the players. What old games didn't tell people was what worked as a GM. You had to figure it out by trial and error. Or by seeing an other GM do it well. DW points to those good moves but the GM still needs practice to build confidence. <br/><br/>BTW the Star Wars games were fun because the players wanted to go for a ride, kind of like a roller coaster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414911/#Comment_414911" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T10:46:51+00:00" title="May 29, 2013 10:46AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Must just be you or the area you are from, because I am loss how you even made that collation. </blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://2.imimg.com/data2/OV/BP/MY-2673812/agro-fertilizer-250x250.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414912/#Comment_414912" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T11:03:20+00:00" title="May 29, 2013 11:03AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is there more of an edgy writing style to the rules in AW?

For instance, how would a 3E feat make a good *World game move?<br/><br/>Where I agree, though, is that, except for the concept of the fictional triggers, most good indie/story games written in the last 7-8 years have very much this sort of rules/fiction "short-circuit straight to story/fun", in my experience: that was the goal of their design, and many (probably all the big names, for sure) succeeded, hence their success. AW moves are, in concept, not very different from Otherkind dice (which Ghost/Echo, Annalise, and lots of other games were based on, it's "old technology" by indie standards - Vincent posted those rules in 2005).<br/><br/><br/>Edited to add: I agree with noofy (and Sanglorian) that the choice of moves colours the thematic focus of a *World game in a most important way. I just don't see the parallel to, say, 3E D&amp;D.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415080/#Comment_415080" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T20:16:05+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  8:16PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the point is you could make Feats into moves, but they'd be bad ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415082/#Comment_415082" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T20:29:56+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  8:29PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, ok!
