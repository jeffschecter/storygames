The PCs are kinda like a post-apocalyptic family or the crew of a fishing boat or a military unit, in that they sometimes fight, but in the end they typically need each other for emotional and practical reasons. That said, the rules for just fucking with other PCs are great: seduce/manipulate, read a person, sex moves, tons of special moves (esp. Brainer and Skinner), etc. And the occasional go aggro is also totally awesome.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts amps this general fuckery with other PCs up a notch, with the String economy and a bunch of other moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/swavomeer" title="swavomeer"><img alt="swavomeer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/642/n9D042GBVCM5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/swavomeer">swavomeer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384940/#Comment_384940" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-12T11:40:51+00:00" title="July 12, 2012 11:40AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are reffering to the "manipulate or seduce" move, then it isn't clunky.

Players make their moves against each other. It gets ugly, maybe someone backs off, maybe someone ends up maimed or left for dead. But you're characters not going to die unless you're cool with that. Sometimes you don't even need to roll or make a move to PvP. <br/>For example Allison the hardholder invites Eternity, the Touchstone into her office to have a "talk" about those shotgun shells she stole back when we made our Hx moves. Balls and Satan lead her into the room and lock the door.<br/><br/>Eternity asks Allison if she can perform a concert for the Hardhold. Allison delicately picks up eternity's hand, turns it over in her own, "Well thats going to be really difficult for you to perform with broken fingers."<br/> Allison spends a hold to to figure out how she can get Allison to let her perform a concert for the hard hold.<br/>Allison says "well when you're all healed up, you can have your concert." then leaves the room. <br/><br/>In the next scene, Eternity is playing the concert using her cast as a slide. Notice that all of that PvP happened with only one move, and that was reading a person. The rest was just fictional positioning.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384977/#Comment_384977" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-12T18:18:35+00:00" title="July 12, 2012  6:18PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ross' point is great.

What the GM does relative to circling and framing conflicts is not fundamentally different from what an AW MC does when creating PC-NPC-PC triangles and applying pressure through scarcity, just much faster (which is the part you say you want to port in from IaWA: instead of letting conflicts brew slowly in play, have built-in conflicts handed you from the setup). But! When PC-PC[-PC-\u2026] conflict finally erupts, in IaWA, it only concerns those 2+ players, anybody else just takes a seat out of the ring and lets them work it out. Whatever comes from the conflict resolution, including permanent death of a PC, is fair: they brought it upon themselves, right? There are mechanical safeguards in place to ensure a conflict is a fair, balanced, equal opportunities sports match with very high stakes on it.<br/><br/>In AW, we're never allowed that level of detachment. Because of the way Moves work, there is no warrant, ever, that a fight is a fair fight. Because of the way Moves and Harm work, among other things, the consequences of just about any direct conflict can be dire, and there's no layer of OOC buffer to undo them. No problem when it's PC-vs-NPC: the MC was already looking at them through crosshairs anyway, right? But then, in PC-vs-PC, since the PCs are the protagonists we all root for, no matter that we're playing to see what happens, we can't just accept <i>any</i> consequence from conflict resolution. Which in practice means that:<br/>\u2665 interesting PC-vs-PC conflicts need to be long, protracted, slow-brewing affairs, with inconclusive battles being fought, truces being called and loyalties changing, friendships being forged before hatreds are rekindled.<br/>\u2665 the MC has to maneuver for the above to happen. That is, <i>since she is a fan of all PCs</i> and wants to <i>make their lives not boring</i>, she has to employ her own moves with purpose to interrupt and delay PC-vs-PC conflicts, interfere with them, and mitigate the severity of any direct consequences PC suffer (preventing their death, usually) while, usually, making indirect consequences (on NPCs, property, hard-holds, etc.) as severe as possible.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385160/#Comment_385160" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-15T00:20:21+00:00" title="July 15, 2012 12:20AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu, that response is awesome and insightful and I need to digest it more before I respond.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385168/#Comment_385168" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-15T07:56:32+00:00" title="July 15, 2012  7:56AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But then, in PC-vs-PC, since the PCs are the protagonists we all root for, no matter that we're playing to see what happens, we can't just accept <i>any</i> consequence from conflict resolution. <br/></blockquote>\nThis makes no sense to me.
