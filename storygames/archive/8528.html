By relationship maps here I mean any kind of map showing relationships between people (or concepts or organisations if that's how you roll, any map of relationships really).<br/><br/>I'm interested in how you've used them in your actual play, including prep.  How they've helped, where they worked and where they didn't, what you included on them and why (Sorceror I think only includes relationships of blood or sex, nothing else). <br/><br/>Essentially I'm interested in learning more about these as a GMing or play tool, I've used them in the past but not since I think the mid 1990s and have got quite out of the habit.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/howandwhy99" title="howandwhy99"><img alt="howandwhy99" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/howandwhy99">howandwhy99</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189047/#Comment_189047" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T12:45:22+00:00" title="January 19, 2009 12:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We typically use them, both as GMs and as players to track who we know and what's going on.  They work pretty well in my opinion.  <br/><br/>As a player we really just use them to help keep track of who we think knows whom in the gameworld.<br/><br/>As a GM I use them to track pretty much everything that's mobile.  That includes people and items.  They can get pretty crazy so I tend to really only track characters that I think are important or the PCs have spent a good deal of time with. <br/><br/>You might also be interested in knowing that sociograms were originally created by the same man who created roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189054/#Comment_189054" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T14:05:37+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  2:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't use them often, usually only when there's going to be a small flood of NPCs to interact with, to remember who is who. For me, it serves as a good reminder, as I'm a visual learner: I remember the NPC (more than just a name) when I have a picture, line, circle or blob to associate it with ("Oh yeah, I remember that person; they were the blue blob who hates the evil red blob").<br/><br/>The last time I used it (and to pretty good success!) was in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4620" rel="nofollow">Night Watch: Seattle</a> game I ran for With Great Power for a few months last year. I (as GM) created a stable of Good characters, Evil characters, Neutral/other characters (about 3-4 of each group), and arranged them simply as circles about 3cm diameter on a single piece of landscape-oriented paper: Dudes on the left good, right evil, neutral (or unknown) middle, and the higher on the paper they were, the more powerful/higher status they were. Then we drew in the players and their few connections the players created for their characters (A girlfriend, a fiancee, and a best friend). <br/><br/>That was the only sort of orientation on that chart. There were no lines or anything tying the characters together or pointing at anything. Each circle had the name of the character, and a 1-3 word description of what they were. Just blobs on a piece of paper.<br/><br/>Still, that chart REALLY helped me drive the sessions. Every single scene I would look at the paper, figure out who hasn't been getting airtime (out of the characters that the players liked/had something to do with the adventure; over time, I dropped one Good, 1 Neutral and 2 Evil characters as anything other than backdrop because we were already getting tons of great, fulfilling traction with the other characters). I'd bring out those characters, start tying them together a little, or make their orientation on the paper "suspect" (over time hinting that one of the Evil characters wasn't evil; she wasn't. And hinting that another of the Evil characters wasn't evil; and she was). Also raised the power of some characters or lowered others throughout the campaign.<br/><br/>I added a few things to the sheet, but I never rewrote it, redrew circles etc as the game went on. I was thinking about that just now; Why didn't I update the chart as characters changed throughout the campaign?  I think that, in the end, remembering *where they were* was more important than *where they are now*. Also, if the map started shifting around all over the place, I might lose track of some characters in the stable. <br/><br/>I can see continuously updating a relationship map for a smaller scale game with fewer NPCs, but for a lot of NPCs, I'm fine with starting off with a great big chart and locking it down, not updating it through the campaign. At the end of the campaign, you can look back and see how things changed over time.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189108/#Comment_189108" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T22:29:49+00:00" title="January 19, 2009 10:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rats in the Walls is based around one.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player creates a number of hatreds, which get put on the chart.

Humanity was the ability to play by your own rules and not the rules of the system.  Lore were acts of domination and submission.  Demons were shivs, tattoos, cell blocks, drugs and so on...<br><br>First, we did character creation as a group:\n<ul>\n<li>David King was in jail for murdering the lawyer of the cult leader who had executed his daughter from behind bars.  <br/></li><li>Visili was a lifer (by choice) who had a cell block for a demon and never wanted to leave.  <br/></li><li>Roman was a convicted ex-cop who had murdered his own partner in an attempt to hide his dark deeds.  </li>\n</ul>\nEach had learned the Lore in order to survive -- or, in the case of the guy with the dead daughter -- to get access to the cult leader and murder him.<br/><br/>David's Kicker was that he discovers his daughter was still alive.<br/>Visili's was that another sorcerer was making a moving to take control of his demon from him.<br/>Roman discovered a member of his crew had betrayed him and set him up for a hit.<br/><br/><br/>In Sorcerer, the PCs created a bunch of fictional elements in character creation, but then the GM takes them and does what he wants with them.  (The Players have full authority over their PCs; the GM owns the NPCs and all the fictional mojo that comes with that.)<br/><br/>So, when David's Player created the cult leader, I decided to run with that.  I made the cult a cornerstone of the game.  <br/><br/>Landsfield Penitentiary had been built a hundred and fifty years ago on the backs of slaves and the destitute.  Landsfield, the man who had built it, was the first sorcerer, developing the lore.  He committed sacrifices in the tunnels under the prison.  He also fathered children so he could sacrifice them (my reasoning was that no act of domination was more "lore-ish" than brutally dominating your own child).  He fathered lots of children, making notes as to where they were to tap them later.<br/><br/>One of his grandsons learned the ways of lore and turned on him.  He in turn had a son, the cult leader that David was seeking, who also learned lore.  Both of these men used the Lore to protect themselves from others who knew lore.  David's father used lore to protect himself from Landsfield, and the cult leader, Carver, used lore to protect himself from <i>his</i> father.  That's why he locked himself up in a cell block he had bound at Landsfield prison and ran his cult from inside the penitentiary: it was one of the safest places to be.<br/><br/>Carver also fathered many children before entering Landsfield Penitentiary and building his power base.  One of them was with David's wife -- he had an affair with the woman while she and David were murdered.  This was why he had ordered the execution of David's daughter.<br/><br/>None of the Players knew about any of this at the outset.  At its simplest form it would look like:<br/><br/>Landsfield<br/>   l<br/>Carver's Father<br/>   l<br/>Carver - <i>affair</i> - Lisa - <i>married</i> - David<br/>         l<br/>Melody<br/><br/>And Melody is the little girl that David thought was his daughter, but really wasn't.<br/><br/>This is a pretty straight up Sorcerer relationship map.  The purpose of the map isn't really to track everyone in the game (though more on that in a moment.)  It certainly isn't there to <i>model</i> reality.  The purpose is a narrative one: People are curious about transgressive acts between people.  The lines where these acts become most pronounced are within family and romance.<br/><br/>The purpose of the relationship map (in <i>Sorcerer</i>) is to create a grabby bit of interpersonal stuff that, as the Players bump into and peel back layers, gives them reason to keep digging out of curiosity and -- most importantly -- make a stand/choice about what they are discovering.<br/><br/><br/>The easiest way to illustrate this is the show <i>Law &amp; Order</i>.  Everyone knows that the stars of the show are not what the show is about.  They don't have "issues."  We know hardly anything about them.  But then, what <i>is</i> the show about?<br/><br/>Well, an episode of <i>Law &amp; Order</i> is about the guest stars. It's about the victim, the murderer, all the suspects who -- every week -- are bound together in a web of loyalties.  It is this guest cast that has the issues: "Will I continue to cover for my husband even though I'm beginning to suspect he murdered our son."<br/><br/>Law &amp; Order is essentially an anthology series (like The Twilight Zone) where ever week we are introduced to a new set of fucked up family/lover dynamics.  Our detectives and prosecutors put pressure on them and the story of what happened is revealed. <br/><br/>That's what a relationship map in <i>Sorcerer</i> is all about.  It's like the spotlight story of an episode of <i>Law &amp; Order</i>.  Because the issues at hand are transgressive actions in relationships of family and romance, people pay attention.  Why this is so grabby for people over abstract issues of politics, for example, I cannot say.  I can only say from the Greek tragedies to today, it works.  If you have to be grabby toward a large group of strangers who have nothing in common except they arrived at a theater or turned on a TV, the easiest way to hook them is with something like this.<br/><br/><br/>So, my relationship map only had four people on it.  But it was also the core of the mystery as to what was happening at the prison.  And Landsfield himself, now a sorcerer lich living in the old tunnels beneath the penitentiary, was a threat that was present that they knew nothing about.<br/><br/>[cont'd]                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189324/#Comment_189324" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T08:32:59+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  8:32AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had no expectation as to how the Players would first bump into all this (or really, if they would).  It was just there.  There was a war going on for control of the prison (the cell blocks, the soil of the prison, the wall were all demonic turf) and anyone who wanted a better handle on the Lore was most likely going to find out about it.  So, even though only David was tied directly to these NPCs, both Roman and Visili had a stake in the information as well.  <br/><br/>As it was, David would find out that the girl who he thought was his daughter really wasn't -- and he had to make a choice as to how to proceed.  Landsfield would try to cut a deal with each one of the PCs.  Carver -- who had been set up to be fucking Hannibal Lector with magic -- would be revealed to be a scared, terrified man who waited every day for his father to come sacrifice him for power.<br/><br/>But that was ultimately the spine.  For convenience I added other NPCs and their relationships.  <br/><br/>The man coming for Visili's cell block I decided would be a nephew.  So I created boxes and lines for Visili's family.  We never got to that part of the map, but it was there. <br/><br/>Roman Player had said Roman not only killed his partner, but a drug dealer who he was working with.  But I changed that around. Stubbs, the drug dealer, was another sorcerer, also living safely in landsfield, and Roman had murdered a shape-shifting passer that Stubbs controlled.  So these relationships went down on the relationship map.<br/><br/>And then there were the alliances between different sorcerers and crews in prison for control of power within the prison.  So I drew little lines about who was allied with who.<br/><br/><br/>The important note, however, was that <i>those alliances could change</i>.  The thing about a core relationship map for <i>Sorcerer</i> is that it <i>can't</i> change.  A father is still a father, even if the relationship change.  The power of the relationship between someone you loved or are the child of or mothered a child with has a power in terms of <i>fiction</i>.  The loyalties and passions can shift around, but the relationship remains the same and remains grabby for an audience.  I can't explain fully why this is.  But I know it tends to work.<br/><br/>You don't need a very big map for a game of <i>Sorcerer</i>. (The bigger the map, the more there is for the Players to discover, of course, which helps carry a greater number of sessions).  In my view, what matters most is the actual relationships, what the acts of transgression are, and giving the Players something to judge. (In this way, the <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> Town Creation rules and the <i>Sorcerer</i> Relationship Map arrive at the same destination, just by different roads.)<br/><br/><br/>So, that's how I used a relationship map in a recent game of <i>Sorcerer</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189718/#Comment_189718" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T08:35:24+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  8:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool story, CK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189761/#Comment_189761" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T11:52:51+00:00" title="January 23, 2009 11:52AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating stuff Christopher.<br/><br/>Are your players cool with your amending parts of their authored game-reality?

I write a monster response... And Jesse handles it with a single link.<br/><br/>Well, I'll post anyway:<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>JD and Max,<br/><br/>Thanks for the nice words!  I was really happy with how it all turned out.<br/><br/><br/>As the for the amending the authored game reality:<br/><br/>First, most importantly, "Were the Players cool it? "  Yes, they had an utter blast.  All they wanted to do was play more. <br/><br/>We usually had a post-session conversation along the line of, "Oh, so this is how the game works!"  Two of the players had read the rules, as well as played, but at the end of the third session one of the Players said, "I'm really liking <i>Sorcerer</i>.  Not just the game we're playing, but how the whole game fits together."  So, at the enthusiasm level, I'm going to assume they were cool with it.<br/><br/>On to more practical matters, this is how <i>Sorcerer</i> is set up.  The Players create lots of fictional stuff that goes directly onto the character sheet ("the back of the character sheet" in the big square), but.... when Play begins the GM has control over that fictional stuff.<br/><br/>In return, however, the game implies a contract on behalf of the GM to the Players:<br/><br/>1) What you write down on the character sheet is what the game will be about (these NPCs, these relationships, these themes...)<br/>2) You get to do whatever you want with your PC.  Whatever.<br/><br/>This is the give and take of <i>Sorcerer</i>.  It's how the GM is able to weave in surprises and mysteries into the game.  (It's one of those weird things I often see on forum boards, this idea that the Players "know everything and run roughshod over the GM with all their fiction" and I'm thinking, "Well, if you set up the game that way, I suppose so... I certainly don't play that way."<br/><br/><br/>So, point (1) is like this: Your guy has a wife, and what matters is that <i>your guy has a wife</i>.  Story-wise, what are we going to do with that fact.  We leave that open, because we want to have the relationship matter to the story. Which means that if we want the wife to do more than that action movie line "John. Be careful," she's going to have her own agendas and stories that the Players can <i>react</i> to via their PCs.<br/><br/>This idea of react to is very important. Note that I never jammed the PCs a certain way into terms of expected reactions or behaviors.  I simply laid at revelations and reversals when the opportunity made sense.  <i>Sorcerer</i> Bangs, in other words.<br/><br/>But tied to this promise is also responsibility.  For example, I'm not just going to kill off the wife.  The Player has said, "My guys has a wife, a relationship with a wife..." so I'm going to KEEP that relationship alive.  I've seen too many GMs take NPCs the Player has either created or met and invested in and think they're doing something interesting by killing that NPC.  But really what the GM is doing is <i>shutting down what the Player cared about!</i><br/><br/>So, while the GM has a lot of authority over the fictional elements that the Player creates, you have to be sensitive to what the Player <i>cares</i> about.  The GM should not obliterate what the Player cares about.  But the GM should deepen the opportunity for the PC to make choices about how to react to these things: does he move away from his wife; does he kill her; does he escape jail and try to reconcile; does he spend the rest of his life pretending that he knows nothing whenever he's around her. These kinds of choices are the stuff of story -- which is what <i>Sorcerer</i> is concerned with.<br/><br/>And, as GM, I try to look at the bread crumbs.  The Player declared that after their daughter was "dead" the wife had to be institutionalized.  Now, lots of people lose their kids, and all are devastated.  But not all end up in a padded cell.  So I began thinking, "Why?  What is here that's even more interesting than, "She got locked up because she was so upset."<br/><br/>Also, it was the Player's Kicker for the PC that the daughter was still alive, so he added this idea that a) something more was going on than met the eye and that needed an answer; and b) the notion that some folks who you think are dead aren't (which inspire the idea that NPC Stubbs was in fact not dead after all.)<br/><br/>So, I started rooting about for more, and came up with the backstory above.  <br/><br/>It is my attempt (at least) to give the Players MORE of what they said they wanted when they made up the fictional elements on the character sheets.  Not to fuck with their fiction, but to deepen it with new facts and choices.<br/><br/>[cont'd]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189775/#Comment_189775" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T12:45:20+00:00" title="January 23, 2009 12:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2009 1:49PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreement (2) above is especially interesting, because around the sixth session someone made the comment about how they loved this elaborate story for their characters I had laid out.  And I said, "Guys.  I have no clue as to what you guys are doing.  I have back story.  But the choices you're making.. these are your choices."<br/><br/>And there was a pause at the table and they realized that I had not guided them one iota in their decision making process.  They hadn't realized this before -- and had to think through the previous six sessions to realize that they had been in the driver's seat the whole game.  As a <i>Sorcerer</i> GM my job is to provide resistance, revelations and reversals -- but not direction.  I make backstory.  The <i>story</i> is up to the Players via their PCs.  What they choose to ignore, what they choose to pursue, who they define as the ultimate bad-guy is all up to them.  If anything, my job is to feed them more of what seems to be interesting. <br/><br/>That's a lot of freedom.  And that's the trade off that you get when you hand the fictional elements you've created over to the GM.  I promise not to destroy or break or make their created fictional elements unplayable.  But I do get <i>play</i> -- because there's a lot as GM I have up my sleeve that I get to reveal.  <br/><br/><br/>The agreement is part of the playing of <i>Sorcerer</i>.  It's how Kickers get transformed into more than the Players expected; how mysteries are possible; how the fiction elements on the "back of the character sheet" remain fresh and even deepen into more complex elements than originally assumed.  But it takes trust and awareness on the part of everyone at the table.  <br/><br/>If a Player said to me, "No way!" after I revealed something, we'd have a talk.  After all -- contra to what lots of folks write on the internet -- all these choices for the PCs <i>come out </i>of the fiction and setting, not all willy-nilly and arbitrary.  If a Player isn't buying an element of revealed fiction then that has to be addressed right away.  We're making stories here.  And that means everyone has t be on board with each piece as we add it.<br/><br/>This isn't how every game is set up, nor should it be. But it is -- exactly as it's phrased in the rules -- how <i>Sorcerer</i> is set up to be played.<br/><br/><br/>And, to repeated, yeah.  The Players loved it.  Because all this stuff gave them plenty of in-character feeling and sensations (Immersion, I think the kids call it), as well as neat dramatic moments, decisions, and actions that drove the tale we created in unexpected away.  The Players had a blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189779/#Comment_189779" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T13:00:14+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  1:00PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Agreement (2) above is especially interesting, because around the sixth session someone made the comment about how I had this elaborate story for their characters laid out.

I was using a town I found online, so after reading through the situation, I drew a loose matrix of the various characters, and their general disposition towards each other, noting when two characters felt the same thing, and when others felt opposite ways. I also numbered the relationships, and marked how the various characters felt about the interesting relationships of the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really helped me keep track and stay focus when playing the town out for my friend.
