One thing I'm a little unsure about is one of the very first character generation instructions.  Basically it says to come up with a situation for the players, then they go through their Lifepaths.<br/><br/>I'm the only one in my group that owns any sort of Character Burner, so one thing I want to do is make the Lifepath, Skill and Trait selection process be relatively simple, otherwise it will take forever.<br/><br/>But let's say we have a situation in which the characters are a team of spies dispatched to a coldly hostile land to perform masked espionage and disguised infiltration.  There's a few Lifepath selections that unlock those kinds of skills, which is fine, but the path to get there is relatively limited.  In other words, you can't get to that final situation in 3 Lifepath choices from any Born choice you make...(unless I'm reading it wrong.)  You need to be Born in a particular way and progress in a particular way to get to a place where that situation makes sense/will work.  <br/><br/>My normal method of doing Lifepaths with people who don't have the book is just to give them their choices at each step "here's your Birth options...now here's your options from that, including Leads elsewhere, etc."  But this won't work if we have a semi-specific situation.<br/><br/>Here are some options I've thought of:<br/><br/>* Back up and create a situation that includes some more naturalistic restrictions on their Lifepaths ("Spies only come from the ranks of formerly enslaved people, so everyone must be Born Slave and immediately take the Lead to blah blah blah" "At this point everyone takes a Lead to become trained by the Bureau of Assassins, and then the game begins")?<br/><br/>* Loosen restrictions on what Leads where and have people use their General skills to get the spy abilities we're interested in, and just go with my previous method?<br/><br/>Any thoughts on this? Have you had issues with people without a Burner in front of them trying to squeeze through Lifepaths to a specific Situation that has a lot of restrictions? Am I overthinking this and it will just work out fine?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399242/#Comment_399242" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T10:52:35+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 10:52AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's <a href="http://bwcharburner.appspot.com/" rel="nofollow">a free online character burner</a>, if the other players have computers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399243/#Comment_399243" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T10:52:59+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 10:52AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2012 10:56AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thanks for that link Brian!<br/><br/>Edit: PS, it seems to care that I have a copy of Burning Wheel, i.e. it asks for particular words.

The characters included sorcerous types, charismatic rogues, duelists, etc.  Benefits of this method included that the characters had a wide array of skills to apply to various problems, and there was a certain level of 'niche' protection from character to character.  The downside was, as you imply, some characters were better at the traditional 'musketeer' roles of fencing etc.  <br/>I guess this is simply your 'normal' method.  These characters were pre-gens for convention games, so obviously I had a lot of control over their write-up.  But the mixes seemed to work fine, and allowed some players and their characters definite spotlight time in specific circumstances.   <br/><br/>One other thought--as another option, perhaps you might write up a new Lifepath with the skills you think essential for the characters.  This isn't too different from your normal method, except that more skill points will be available to spend on the essential skills, plus you can tweak the traits and resources as well.  It's possible for Lifepaths to be in different settings, so your new Lifepath can be relatively flexible in how characters get there.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399258/#Comment_399258" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T13:27:33+00:00" title="November 30, 2012  1:27PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, are you familiar enough with BW to burn backwards?

A full session is recommended for character and world burning. As far as I know, the Lifepath system was designed to be its own minigame. And also as far as I know, the philosophy of Burning Wheel is that it rewards system mastery and punishes its lack. Therefore, before you master the minigame of character building, it's easy to get suboptimal results.<br/><br/>What I'd do is research the lifepaths through which you can get at the spy skills, get several character ideas and pitch them to players before session. Then, either fully prebuild characters or walk the players through the character creation (spending points etc), but just tell them which lifepaths to use.<br/><br/>Or, alternatively, you can let people play characters that aren't professional spies and only acquire the relevant skills in play.

It's perfectly fine to pitch an idea, but what you may find, even if your players accept your basic premise, is that one of them wants to play the spy, while another wants to play, say, the spy's lover, and another the spy's erstwhile employer.<br/><br/>Basically, what I'm saying is, you need a more specific situation, and *much* more specific character concepts, before you can actually proceed with burning.

They're highly, HIGHLY dedicated to being on a team together, it's one of the main draws of the game for them.  They just won't make semi-disconnected characters, for many reasons having to do with social interactions and spotlight time.  (This makes games like PTA and Dresden Files above a certain power level to be not a great fit and IAWA to be a flat out bad idea.)<br/><br/>I've found that having a super-specific character concept when you don't have experience with the character burner to be difficult and counterproductive even when I have the burner in front of me, so I'm surprised to hear you say the opposite.  Normally I find my best BW characters to be created more organically. I have a general idea of a set of capabilities, and through the burner I "discover" a character than is inside that set even if it's not exactly a bullseye.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399333/#Comment_399333" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-02T04:54:30+00:00" title="December  2, 2012  4:54AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2012 4:55AM by Johnstone.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is that really specific character concepts only work if you know what you can get out of the LPs ahead of time, or all you care about is just one (like the final) LP.

In fact, one of the flaws of some of the BW con scenarios is that they emphasize PvP too much*. I'm saying that I think BW really wants characters who are interconnected but come from different places or levels within the setting, or different niches in D&amp;D terms.<br/><br/>Regarding the problems with specificity of concept: with 5 LPs you can generally do it, with 4 it's tougher, with 3 it's impossible for most concepts. Even with 5 you may have to work with the player to help them focus on what's absolutely essential for them to have at the outset, and what they're willing to work to grow into later.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*That said, if the players are unable to even entertain the notion of occasional PvP conflicts, mainly in the form of arguments, then BW is not a workable game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399343/#Comment_399343" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-02T09:28:18+00:00" title="December  2, 2012  9:28AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They can argue - I did find in Smallville that they were reluctant to engage mechanics around that argument even if it was to their undeniable advantage. <br/><br/>Anyway, as I mentioned above, I decided against BW for other reasons, but I'm still interested in best practices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399370/#Comment_399370" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-02T14:38:11+00:00" title="December  2, 2012  2:38PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, for best practices in a scenario like this, I'd say two things:<br/><br/>1) Given the lack of a specific spy life-path*, I'd suggest that the best thing to do is say that spying is something the characters do, not a profession the characters have. Then ask them what sorts of other backgrounds might have the right sort of skills to help them do what the need to do. More or less those people will come up with are pretty well equipped for some sort of spy activity, or at least the ones that come to my mind: Peddler, Performer, Criminal, Pickpocket, Student, Merchant, Smuggler, Blackmailer, Poisoner, Smuggler, etc.  All of those are pretty easy to pick up even with 3-4 lifepaths, just so long as you don't expect them to be super competent. (Merchant is the tricky one, but you can take Village Merchant with Smuggler, which is actually just about perfect. I also like Born City -&gt; Student -&gt; Engineer -&gt; Duellist.)<br/><br/>2) Burning Wheel is best for specific situations with characters already in place, as a couple of people have mentioned. In this sort of set up, I'd suggest that rather than burning a team of spies and sending them somewhere, like in a modern-day action flick, you make something a little more like a spy-story set-up: burn up a spy ring that is already in place, with various agents, contacts, etc. They decide who is who in the operation, how it works, where they are, and so on. This has two big advantages: first, who and where the characters are becomes as important as their skills. One of them is a partially trained servant of the target? Great! Second, this way you will get much more out of Circles, Resources, Relationships, and Beliefs because they will tied into the situation. Then you can start the game with something happening: another agent is captured, a war starts, an assassination, whatever and they will be ready to go straight into action.<br/><br/>* Yes, there is a Spy lifepath in the the Death-Cult setting of the Magic Burner. You could just use that if you wanted to give them training, but otherwise it is pretty useless for what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399395/#Comment_399395" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-02T22:49:41+00:00" title="December  2, 2012 10:49PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One aspect of the game is that I do want them to be sent somewhere, but their job is not going to be to just accomplish a mission and leave, but instead to establish an espionage and intelligence capability in that (hostile) location.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399563/#Comment_399563" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T12:30:51+00:00" title="December  4, 2012 12:30PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One aspect of the game is that I do want them to be sent somewhere, but their job is not going to be to just accomplish a mission and leave, but instead to establish an espionage and intelligence capability in that (hostile) location.</blockquote>\nThis sounds like a pretty fun game.<br/><br/>Actually, I tried writing a game system just for this premise, but it was a mess and I gave up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/countercheck" title="countercheck"><img alt="countercheck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/countercheck">countercheck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399572/#Comment_399572" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T13:10:02+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  1:10PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do not underestimate the Young Lady and Lady lifepaths for espionage.
