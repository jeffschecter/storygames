A question that recently occurred to me is, why are there stats in Apocalypse world? <br/><br/>I mean is this meaningful gameplay? You have to choose a line of stats, with one of them being constantly high, A player can pick to build a character who has synergy between stats (usually make as much as possible roll of your best stat), is this part of the strategic gaming in AW?<br/><br/>Are stats a hold over? Are there better ways to achieve the idea that, some characters a better at some things and worse at others? Is that even a meaningful assumption in game design?<br/><br/>Do you have an example of something that works better?<br/><br/>My example is AW but this could easily be a discussion of the use of stats in games in general.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476188/#Comment_476188" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-18T13:05:03+00:00" title="August 18, 2018  1:05PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stats/Attributes are practical for a sort of old school game where no other bonuses are considered and skills/equipment just enable your character to try some thing, or lower the difficulty in the best case.<br/><br/>Stats don't need to be linked to particular skills as one may start thinking by playing 3.5. They work better when used as in VtM, as a mix of one stat and one skill that may vary depending on the situation. You could roll Dexterity with Acrobatics to make a backwards somersault or roll Intelligence with Acrobatics to remember which thief guild made that maneuver their trademark.<br/><br/>A problem arises when the design gives skills a bonus to be added to the stats and the roll, because that makes rolling just the stats an unfair useless business. So you need to add bonuses for saves and things like that.<br/><br/>The whole deal may end up being so complicate that it makes you think,<i> hey, why don't ditch stats and make it just a skill system?</i> Skill based systems also work perfectly, they go straight to the point if you have the right skill list for your setting. You get to save time both in rolling and recalculating things when you level up or get some sort of penalty.<br/><br/>But they don't save you from character optimization, unless the GM makes everyone roll all kind of skills all the time. But that's rare, as each group story preferences will make five or six skills more relevant than the others. Among those you will usually find some umbalance, like a skill that doubles for two or more different uses, or one that is OP in the setting.<br/><br/>Then you may read some OSR that may bring you back to use only stats, as they are sort of general skills that also simulate a character's build. You can have the players describe  exactly what do their characters do and lower the DC when what they say shows expertise in their profession. But as this requires the players to learn by trial and error what constitutes good practices and what not, you may end up going back full circle to whatever worked best for you.<br/><br/><br/>So basically, anything will work with a group that it's used to it and there is no perfect design that will work for everyone. Go for whatever feels more familiar and easier to use for you and your group. Personally I made my last hack more DW like but made the skills/items give no static bonuses but additional dice instead. So your chances are better but the math doesn't break too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476195/#Comment_476195" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-18T18:01:16+00:00" title="August 18, 2018  6:01PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was definitely considering the adding dice instead of a modifier.

If everybody's got an Agility stat, you can write "Roll against Agility to avoid this attack," and it'll make sense. In the case of <i>Apocalypse World</i>, you can write "When you do something under fire, roll+cool," and it makes sense, because everyone's got a Cool stat. <br/><br/>In <i>Over the Edge</i> (the original version, not the new edition coming out soon), you don't have stats. Everybody is made of freeform traits, rated in dice, and there's a default of 2d6. So if you want to do something, you convince the GM that you've got a trait that can cover it, and roll that many dice (usually 3 or 4), or if you fail to convince them, roll the default 2d6. This has the advantage of flexibility, but the disadvantage that you sometimes have to spend a bit of time haggling.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476214/#Comment_476214" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-19T17:45:12+00:00" title="August 19, 2018  5:45PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AW gathered up some trad stuff and presented it in a fresh an innovative ways.

As well as suggestions and examples of adding dice instead of a modifier. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476278/#Comment_476278" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T02:08:48+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  2:08AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Because when I ask and answer those questions, one of the first things that occurs to me based on playing AW is that the stats you use are inextricable from the story.

Recently, I\u2019ve started thinking about stats more thematically, which leads to three conclusions about why you want them in a game.<br/><br/>The first is that they incentivize and shape player behavior in directions that support the feel of the story you\u2019re trying to tell. If you\u2019re playing a game about teen romance, your characters probably aren\u2019t going to be jumping off rooftops with swords, so you don\u2019t need a bunch of differentiated physical stats \u2013 but you might want to give empathy and charm their own stats. And once you do that, you\u2019ve both indicated to players that those are important qualities in this game, and gotten them to think more about doing in-game actions that make use of those qualities.<br/><br/>Leading off of that is the second item, which is that stats don\u2019t just provide information about what characters can do in the world, they provide info about who the characters <i>are</i>. This helps in roleplaying and helps create a more interesting cast in the game story. So you\u2019re not just getting players to think about the actions they can and should take, but to think about what their characters are like. A character with high Moxy and low Style is a totally different person from a character with high Beefiness and low Wits.<br/><br/>The third item is more prosaic and mechanical, but just as important for creating a good experience, and that\u2019s character differentiation. Stats are an easy way to differentiate one character from another. And you want differentiated characters because you want different characters to be able to solve problems in different ways, which allows everyone in a game to participate. Stats incentivize players to naturally pass different problems to each other, which is good for the player group dynamic and good for story interest.<br/><br/>Obviously, there are other ways to achieve these ends. But stats are a really good shortcut, especially when you tie them to the themes of the game instead of going with the traditional idea of \u201ccover all human qualities\u201d.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476280/#Comment_476280" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T04:24:24+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  4:24AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed.

That says something very different about what this world is like, and what kinds of stories exist in it.<br/><br/>A perfect example is <i>Trollbabe</i> (and its baby version, at least in this respect: <i>Lasers &amp; Feelings</i>), where this dynamic is laid bare in character creation.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476302/#Comment_476302" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T18:18:09+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  6:18PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is exactly why I love Lasers &amp; Feelings so much, and find it so delightfully hackable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476304/#Comment_476304" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T19:49:14+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  7:49PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you roll dice for what the game considers important, and when your stats plug into those rolls, then the set of stats becomes a decent map for the game's focus.<br/><br/>The list on the character sheet of Hot, Hard, Cool, Sharp indicates that the character will be facing opportunities for seduction, violence, danger, and important reads, and describes their options.

I conceptualized this more in traditional D&amp;D play. But in AW you switch which of these stats around. So you the battle babe for example are controlling the battlefield by how cool you are instead of how hard you are. I can definitely seeing this working conceptually, but in practice (IME) it doesn't end up being very central to a players idea of who the character is really. Add to that I kind of want that to be something the player figures out rather than something that you pick off a line of choices, i mean honestly you should be able to decide <i>why</i> your character failed at a task to some extent. I dunno I digress.<br/><br/>I think your other two points are very strong in my opinion. First the idea that what stats are in play act as flags for important traits in the setting/game. I suspect this is a huge reason Vincent did it that way, and I see hacks definitely use these to make a statement about what <i>their </i>game is about. That and its an effective mechanical way to create a varied cast of abilities and incentives.<br/><br/>I don't think stats are wrong in Apocalypse words, I just sense the design manipulating the stats in such a way as I could see doing something different with the design. That was the thought I was trying to articulate at least.<br/><br/>Lasers and feelings is a very interesting example for what can be done with the idea of a stat, its both very specific (one number) and as broad as <i>every character task</i>. It definitively acts as a flag for setting/game concept but really doesn't tell <i>too</i> much about the character.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476323/#Comment_476323" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T02:00:15+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  2:00AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2018 2:00AM by Kenny_J.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/stefoid" rel="nofollow">stefoid</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>when you put it just like that, it makes me wonder if there are games where rather than ask the player to describe what they are good at, and assume they suck at everything else, ask the players to name things they are bad at, and assume they are competent in other areas.

These are the perils of trying to quote parts of posts on mobile.<br/><br/>Reading your last post makes me want to figure out if there\u2019s a way to arrive at the design goals that stats achieve without using stats. Because I still think getting characters to act in theme, defining characters, and cast differentiation are really good goals. I suspect the most straightforward path is designing a game that doesn\u2019t use dice as a resolution mechanic?<br/><br/>Also have to disagree about Lasers &amp; Feelings. I lean towards minimalism, so I think you actually get much more out of a character defined by a single strong trait than a character defined by an array of traits competing for player attention. When you have just one trait, you can really lean into it and inhabit it to its full depth. When you have a bunch of traits, you have to keep all of them in your head at once, and they\u2019ll keep overruling each other, which makes your character muddier. Consider: When you have to make a decision, is it easier if you have 6 separate vectors to consider or just one? Is it snappier to figure out how your character acts when they\u2019ve got 6 competing values &amp; characteristics or just one clear one?<br/><br/>Obviously this is also a stylistic choice \u2013 there are plenty of games where you want a lot of complexity in your character decisions. And there\u2019s only so long you can play a one-trait character before doing so becomes stale. But I don\u2019t feel, at the core of it, that a single stat is <i>inherently</i> a weaker way of defining a character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476341/#Comment_476341" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T16:05:45+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  4:05PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just played On the Ecology of the Mud Dragon.

An array of "basic stats" leads us to conceptualize the world in a certain way, much in the same way that a set of classes leads us to think about the world in a certain way.<br/><br/>"This is a place/time where being Smart and Strong is important. The people we care about are either Mechanics or Priests..."<br/><br/>These things can place expectations or constraints on what kinds of characters we can have. (And, typically, one of the points of "stats" is to force players to distribute qualities and weaknesses in a certain way - you can have *this* but not *that. Incidentally, this is one of the reasons why some people are not fond of "stat substitution" moves in AW, I think.)<br/><br/>Imagine this kind of setup, for instance. You can see how setting up a game this way sends a very strong message about what it's about and what kinds of characters are possible, as well as how we will end up thinking and/or feeling about them.<br/><br/>* The possible character types are Democrat or Republican.<br/><br/>* When you make your character, distribute 5 points between Innocence and Popular Appeal.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476350/#Comment_476350" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T19:56:54+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  7:56PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2018 8:00PM by Kenny_J.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DBB" rel="nofollow">DBB</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">@Kenny_J</a> \u2013 Whoops! These are the perils of trying to quote parts of posts on mobile.<br/><br/>Also have to disagree about Lasers &amp; Feelings. I lean towards minimalism, so I think you actually get much more out of a character defined by a single strong trait than a character defined by an array of traits competing for player attention....<br/><br/>...But I don\u2019t feel, at the core of it, that a single stat is <i>inherently</i> a weaker way of defining a character.</p></div></blockquote>\nI wasn't saying Lasers &amp; Feelings was <i>weaker</i> at defining a character, nor was I arguing for more stats=more character. I was arguing just the opposite really. I was saying that stats can sometimes get in the way of me conceptualizing a character rather than helping, I think we are actually in agreement here.<br/><br/>About Lasers &amp; Feelings when I said "really doesn't tell <i>too </i>much about the character" I was simply saying that it just says one thing about a character rather than a whole array, again referring to your point about using stats to say who the character <i>is</i>.<br/><br/>So based on your post just now it sounds like we are in total agreement here.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476353/#Comment_476353" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T20:42:22+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  8:42PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha yes it does!
