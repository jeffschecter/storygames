And I have to admit, old modules used to confuse the crap out of me because of how limited they were. But then I discovered AD&amp;D 1e's modules, and I was blown away.<br/><br/>Take for example The Keep on the Borderlands. It's not a pre-written story at all. In fact, it doesn't even have all that much in the way of motivation for going into the Caves of Chaos (the local hole in the ground filled with monsters) in the book itself. It does have a ton of NPCs and shops and such that have just enough background to be evocative. The Caves of Chaos are filled with subtle things to clue you into how AD&amp;D thought dungeons should be. There are half a dozen different ways to get into the cave, a bunch of ways to navigate through it, and even the monsters have pretty decent backgrounds for figuring out what sort of things they'll do. It's a situation in a folder, and actually does provide a good example for how to run AD&amp;D and be cool adventure in it's own right.<br/><br/>I even love how it has a secret passage that leads to a different Module entirely (sold separately).<br/><br/>What Moduels and Adventures are really, really good? Ones that really make a game sing? Ones that go beyond what you're used to in modules?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395828/#Comment_395828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T00:17:12+00:00" title="November  2, 2012 12:17AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it was a surprise for me when I discovered that what the fuck, apparently the RPG culture completely <i>regressed</i> in the 1980s in many ways, including a dramatic loss of module writing proficiency. Early D&amp;D adventures are easily the best ready-made adventures I've ever seen, and I say this as somebody who learned over the '90s to simply ignore prewritten modules; the stuff available at the time simply wasn't relevant.<br/><br/>D&amp;D adventures of the old school bend, on the other hand, easily match up to my requirements of focused design: they know how they're supposed to be played, very rarely instruct the GM to make moves against the rules and are built dynamically, to fully incorporate player input. Looking at the big picture this seems like an accident of design in that location-based adventures (not coincidentally akin to wargame campaigns) just happen to naturally be good for dynamic play; when the same company started to create adventure modules that attempted to have more drama (or not even drama, just making an urban adventure without a specific adventure location was too much), they quickly spiraled into the railroad pit and turned their adventures into exactly the sort of fiction-writing that made adventure modules irrelevant in my youth.<br/><br/>All that being said, we've seen that old D&amp;D recipe being revived with great success by the OSR lately. I'm personally particularly fond of Jim Raggi's stuff that attempts to push the tradition and sometimes succeeds. <i>Death Frost Doom</i> is the flagship in many ways. There are also other really great things being made. I should mention <i>Anomalous Subsurface Environment</i> for its impressive stylings and impeccable methodology, at least. And <i>Ursined, Sealed, Delivered</i>, it's a rare wilderness-based <i>tournament module</i> with a hard-iron grip upon the creative agenda of gamism. There are a great number of other great adventure modules that I've enjoyed over the last couple of years, too, but just listing the good ones would make for too long a list. Creating a D&amp;D module is in a way solved technology, it's not easy to differ between "perfectly executed but ordinary" and "exceptionally good".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395858/#Comment_395858" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T06:12:08+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  6:12AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Looking at the big picture this seems like an accident of design in that location-based adventures (not coincidentally akin to wargame campaigns) just happen to naturally be good for dynamic play; when the same company started to create adventure modules that attempted to have more drama (or not even drama, just making an urban adventure without a specific adventure location was too much), they quickly spiraled into the railroad pit and turned their adventures into exactly the sort of fiction-writing that made adventure modules irrelevant in my youth.</blockquote>\nPretty much this.<br/><br/>There were a couple of early/mid school modules that were designed to introduce new characters into a setting. They did tend to have both a some decent setting info and a fairly railroaded adventure ( or series of encounters more accurately) in them, but the core concept was that when the players had gotten through the initial railroad, the setting would open up for both the Gm and the players.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the two that come to my mind are both urban adventures. <i>GB1:Trouble Brewing</i> for Gangbusters introduces the default setting and puts new charaters of any class through their paces as a mob war breaks out and draws everyone in in one fashion or another. At the end of events, characters should have interacted with a good chunk of the setting NPCs, learned some secrets/relationships, and should ( if they survived) have made a bit of  reputation for themselves.<br/><br/><i>The Veiled Society</i> for Basic D&amp;D is a heavily railroaded series of short adventures made for low level characters in an urban setting. It may even end up with the PCs in various competing factions ( something suggested in the module itself) when those are over.<br/><br/>Both probably should be looked at like pilots for a TV show. They're meant to kick things off, then participants take them further based on the core events that brought it all together.<br/><br/>Another old module I love is <i>The Horror on the Hill</i>, also for basic D&amp;D. It's a big ass dungeon crawl, and finally! there's an actual dragon encounter and the PCs may even be able to handle it if they're smart and lucky. Hell, they may end up with a dragon as pet/companion/for sale.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395879/#Comment_395879" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T07:40:06+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  7:40AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to mention The Haunting / The Haunted House for Call of Cthulhu that has been included in every edition as far as I know but still is a good Introduction to the game. It has the Investigation part and some locations outside the house, it has a few layers of horror to discover and the haunted house with good ideas that can happen during the Exploration. Getting hired or inheriting the house are both allright motivations to go there and discover terrible secrets. It does not even follow the Cthulhumatrix all that closely, even if it is one of the first adventures.<br/>Unknown Armies has "Jailbreak" in the One Shots book. Which is about experiencing the psychological and supernatural horror of a situation and lives from how players are interpreting the  pregenerated characters, who all have a nice role in turning the whole thing into a Fiasco.<br/>Convergence from Delta Green always worked for me, a creepy town, your government job as the motivation and body horror coupeled with layers of secrets again. It introduces the factions of the Delta Green world too.<br/><br/>I am not sure how much you people would be in adventures only out in German language.

OMFG it's awesome. I was just thinking about that one since the local retro games group is talking about Paranoia!<br/><br/>For D&amp;D, I particularly liked some like The Night Below box set since it was so sandboxy in setup. I6 had a similar awesomeness, where you get a castle, and Strahd is "The Big Bad", but you could go anywhere and discover secrets. I also really liked Gates of Firestorm Peak, but I don't recall exactly why. <br/><br/>For Cthulhu action, I really like The Armitage Files put out not too long ago for Trail of Cthulhu from Pelgrane. <br/><br/>One Shots for Unknown Armies was my "go to" for a quick game for the longest time.

How could I have forgotten The Burning Wheel! The Sword is to The Burning Wheel what Keep on the Borderlands is to AD&amp;D. It's exactly perfect for learning how to play the game, despite (or maybe because of) the fact that it's competitive. You have four adventurers go into a deep dark place, and then they all try to prove they should have The Sword. Especially fun because it will probably end in extreme tragedy, and it's 90% player driven after the setup, with the GM applying pressure where needed to keep it tense.<br/><br/>The Gift for the Burning Wheel is also good. A bunch of elves go to visit a Dwarven hold and bring a gift to the newly crowned prince. Hilarity (and occasionally murder) ensues. The really cool thing about the setup is that it makes an eight player game work, and you're never quite sure who's on what side until the end, not because of secrets, but because of really well-written and complex motivations to play off each other with. Loads of fun to play, and it never ends the same way twice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395951/#Comment_395951" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T16:23:44+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  4:23PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's the one with the giant, self-aware tank right?

This is what <i>should</i> be the cliche, but isn't. No employer planning from word one to betray the PCs. Payment to be made in stock of the company that the employer wants to take over -- the more damage you do, the less your stock is worth. It's beautiful.<br/><br/>Midnight Circus for Old World of Darkness, which, to my utter shock, both worked well enough for all five games to date and didn't railroad. It had a timeline of what would happen if the PCs didn't get involved and presumed that this timeline would go to heck within, oh, thirty seconds of game start.<br/><br/>For Call of Cthulhu, I'd need to reread the material to see how much of what I remember is damned good writing and how much is "and then I tweak it this way so it doesn't break". That said...<br/><br/>I definitely tweak Tatters of the King, which has gorgeous set pieces, a great understanding of how to follow the rules and not kill off the PCs too quickly, a good overview of NPC combat tactics -- and some godawful stitching between pieces. And now the PCs wait until an NPC they don't know nor have any reason to trust writes them a letter telling them what to do? Understand, I love this scenario. I ran it twice, once heavily modified, once straight -- except for the tweaks to make it work despite the stitching weakness -- and I'd gladly run it again.<br/><br/>Beyond the Mountains of Madness has railroad issues, but I will say that when I contacted one of the authors, he was entirely supportive and cool with it when I made some changes to allow for greater agency. (Side point: "You can change what you don't like" does <i>not</i> make a poor scenario or game a good one.)<br/><br/>At Your Door worked really well for my first time gming, despite the many, many mistakes I made.<br/><br/>Oscar Rios's "Setting Sun, Rising Tide" for CoC is one of the edgiest games I've played in. It's what I think parts of Vampire's Giovanni Chronicles were trying to achieve. The players almost certainly know exactly where things are going, but the heart of the scenario is the PCs making a gut wrenching decision based on incomplete information and NO mythos knowledge -- and then playing out the consequences, almost as a Fiasco-like epilogue. I don't know if Oscar's ever going to get this one published.<br/><br/>That's probably more than enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396290/#Comment_396290" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T00:01:39+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 12:01AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is "Setting Sun, Rising Tide" the WW2-from-the-Japanese-POV one?

Not only are they the iconic, defining modules for the WFRP, but together they form a very nice introduction to GMing. <br/><br/>Mistaken Identity starts on a coachride, with a pre-defined goal, and introduces the recurring mystery of Kastor Liberung and The Purple Hand along the way. A very simple first scenario for a GM to get right. This leads into the slightly more open-ended Shadows over B\xf6genhafen, wich takes place in a mid-size city - slightly more challenging for both GM and players, but in a very manageable way. The third part, Death on the Reik, takes place over a larger geographical area and gives quite a lot more freedom to the players, but still has a definitive plot in place and enough guidance for the GM. That all adventures contains good art and writing, along with some very memorable set-pieces is of course part of their charm. I've GMed them twice, for two different groups, and the characters and situations are still vivid in my mind.<br/><br/>The sad fact that the rest of TEW doesn't quite deliver on the promise of these three is a fault of the campaign as a whole, not the individual adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arioch" title="Arioch"><img alt="Arioch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://images.mmorpg.com/images/avatars/ChaosStar1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arioch">Arioch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396309/#Comment_396309" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T04:27:10+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  4:27AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of the old MERP modules (especially the campaign settings) were pretty good IMO: no real plot to follow, just a lot of interesting locations described in detail, some random encounter tables, a bunch of NPCs with their agendas and some possible hooks and rewards.<br/>The Barrow-Downs lured you with their too-good-to-be-true loot (if you could just find a way around the barrow-wights curses...), and Moria was a huge (and mostly randomized) dungeon-crawl, with the most badass dungeon boss of all times, the Balrog itself!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396507/#Comment_396507" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T20:50:35+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  8:50PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since someone mentioned Marvel Heroic, I have to just say that Breakout is the best intro scenario to a new syste, I've ever played.
