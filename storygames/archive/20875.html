(Thoroughly tested and I'm happy with them.)<br/><br/>The two modules are L1, the Secret of Bone Hill, and B10, Night's Dark Terror. I've read part of the latter and even run part of it, and have been looking at reviews of both games. One thing I've noticed--and one reviewer even called this out explicitly--is that there is a risk of a certain vanilla, generic feeling to the sort of sandbox-but-with-goals play that these modules encourage.<br/><br/>I'd like to devise one or two really good, simple techniques for upping the fantasy wonder and weirdness level of modules in this vein, without requiring either extensive prep nor further major rules mods.<br/><br/>Any thoughts? Feel free to draw on other games you've played that you think do this particularly well.<br/><br/>My current thoughts, in brief since I need to go:<br/>-Failure consequences: as often as possible, use failed rolls to introduce not just complications, but magical/mysterious/wondrous obstacles.<br/>-Knowledge rolls: the DC of Arcana/History/etc rolls is 5 lower if the fact you are trying to introduce contains significant fantastical elements.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458236/#Comment_458236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-21T19:21:49+00:00" title="November 21, 2016  7:21PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm just off-hand<br/><br/><b>Attunement</b><br/>The interesting history from the 5th ed attunement thread (we are adding this to our game):<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20873/attunement-in-5e#latest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20873/attunement-in-5e#latest</a><br/><br/><b>For Knowledge checks</b><br/>On a failure you get two pieces of information, possible conflicting or unwelcome info<br/><br/><b>L1</b><br/>For L1 starting off the PCs as being from the town or with deep ties to it is a good way to anchor the sandbox.

David's list of "take the mundane and make it _____" is excellent, but I'd add that you want to show, not tell. Don't say that it's incredibly ancient; say that centuries of moss have overgrown every inch of the marble, and there appears to be carved letters in a strange language, hidden underneath. <br/><br/>Take normal things and exaggerate them. For example, when I run Keep on the Borderlands, I transform the small Caves of Chaos complex into an enormous box canyon. I surround the Keep itself with the smoldering ashes of a village burned by goblins.<br/><br/>Also, "wonder" is often inexplicable. A skill check to understand something's origin <i>destroys wonder</i>, it doesn't create it. Why is this ring of rusted iron pillars here in the forest? <i>No one knows.</i> But it can become a useful waypoint for adventurers and maybe even a good base camp, if you resist the urge to make it dangerous. Heck, give it a strange but light healing property. That makes it weirder, that there's this safe place out in the middle of the dangerous wilds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458260/#Comment_458260" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-23T18:13:33+00:00" title="November 23, 2016  6:13PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff all.

Then make a few themes: "This has been touched by the Spider-god, Kernun'eth," "This is not what it appears to be", "This is uncorrupted and pure".<br/><br/>Make up some kind of roll so that a number of those "things" will randomly be matched with a theme. You'll find out that the Orc chieftain is "uncorrupted and pure", the PCs' amulet is not what it appears to be, and that the local town priest's statue has been touched by the Spider-god. <br/><br/>Just let that sit for a while, and see if it inspires anything in play. For now, just let it influence your description of those things; later, you may discover something yourself. It will come to you, like, "Of course!" Some combination of developing play and the vague prompt will narrow down your options and something will jump out at you.<br/><br/>I might describe the priest's statue as strange and foreboding, the limbs too long. A large spider has made a nest in one of his eye-sockets. I don't know why yet. But the module tells me that praying by the statue allows one to heal 1d6 hit points. Well, why is that? It's suddenly taken on a new meaning, and the players will wonder about it, maybe feel suspicious about it. Do the villagers feel it, too, or are they oblivious?<br/><br/>It will work forwards, too - in the opposite direction - because now something thematic has been established. What if something found in the dungeon is also spider-like? Does that mean is might have healing properties? Or some other healing source might become arachnoid in my mind, instead. The module lists a healing potion? Now it's a bottle full of live spiders, which crawl eagerly down your throat.

I've been reading the journey rules in Adventures in Middle Earth, the The One Ring supplement for 5E, to adapt for Whitehack and there are two events in the journey event table that gave me a sense of wonder from just reading them.<br/><br/>The first is when the PCs find themselves in front of a beautiful vista; a mountain range, an sunset, or something similar. They each roll WIS or INT (Investigation). If successful, they see the beauty of the scene and recover one exhaustion level. If failed, they see brooding clouds and hard paths to travel and gain one exhaustion level. I like how this is not a combat or a conflict, but still has mechanical consequences.<br/><br/>The second, the one that your post reminded me of, is when the PCs find a relic from past ages, for example a statue or an old building. Each PC rolls WIS. If successful, they gain hope from this glimmer of the past, but if failed they see the decay of old glory and is filled with a sense of doom. If successful by 5 or more, they gain inspiration and recover one exhaustion level. If successful, they gain inspiration. If failed, they must make a corruption save or gain two Shadow points (introduced in Adventures in Middle Earth) and if failed by five or more they gain one exhaustion level in addition to the Shadow points.<br/><br/>I agree with you that rolling to understand something's origin may destroy wonder, but rolling to see how the PCs react to it can, with the right group, give the event some lasting significance. Some groups would prefer to leave that to pure acting instead of mechanical bonuses, so each group must of course decide for themselves. I just like how the same event can inspire hope or dread depending on the PCs. I feel like the sense of wonder is the mix of those feelings, and the roll tells which side gets the upper hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458271/#Comment_458271" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-24T01:42:50+00:00" title="November 24, 2016  1:42AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd add that you want to show, not tell.

I've secretly decided this forest was once hideously magically active, and devoured intelligent creatures, warping them to its own ends. (This is basically the premise of Naomi Novik's excellent Russian fairy-tale-esque novel "Uprooted," which I just read with my book club.) The PCs are trying to get somewhere in a hurry; I call for a group Survival test, DC 15, which they fail.<br/><br/>This being early in the campaign, I now roll on my tables. I get "overwhelming / technological / place / shriek." They not only get lost, but they stumble into an ancient bunker made of pure metal, something the inhabitants of the forest made during their war against the evil trees. Furthermore, they trip the alarm, which does no damage, but emits a piercing wail, no doubt alerting everything evil or aggressive within miles.<br/><br/>Now, later in the campaign, once I've made a few of these rolls, I'll give myself permission to simply continue filling in what's already been established on future failed rolls, *and* start giving out information about this stuff on successful rolls, if the PCs seem interested in it.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458279/#Comment_458279" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-24T06:23:34+00:00" title="November 24, 2016  6:23AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see!
