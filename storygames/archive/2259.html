                    So, stop me if you've heard this one...<br/><br/>I had an idea the other day about using Flashbacks as a character advancement device. I'm working on a game, called <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shelterstories/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stories from the Shelter</a>, in which homeless and runaway teenage humans get recruited into a secret alien galactic police force. Obviously, its a space opera, with many influences that will be familiar to those participating in the Story Games forums. It is an RPG adaptation of the work of a friend of mine, Scott Milner, who long ago started creating his ideal TV series. We used to roleplay in this world as teens, and I thought "wouldn't it be neat to make a 'real' game out of it?" Well, that was three years ago, and I'm still chugging. I'm sure you can relate. <br/><br/>I mention the stuff about Scott's work for background. See, most of the five-season story arc Scott has worked out takes place during the training program for these recruited kids. To avoid the boredom of play sessions involving what classes everyone was attending that day, I decided to set the game just after graduation, so players could jump right into their roles as protectors of the galaxy. But, these characters are heavy with background experience from their lives on the streets, and from whatever interesting things might have happened during training. I have tried to accommodate these backgrounds with separate Abilities allocation during CharGen, but that can only go so far before it just gets tedious (and it may be too much so already).<br/><br/>So, it occurred to me, what about referring back to interesting stuff from the characters' pasts through flashback, in such a way that they either gain a bonus to some Ability check they are making, produce some heretofore unknown Ability proficiency, or perhaps some other benefit? Players could initiate a Flashback at an appropriate time by spending experience points, perhaps at an escalating cost depending on the effect they want. Then you take a few moments to have the player narrate the Flashback. To keep other players from getting up to go pee during this time, I would require some sort of story-interaction within the Flashback, rather than a pure narration, with the other players taking on temporary roles. I would even like the outcome of the Flashback to be somewhat in question from the beginning, such that the effectiveness of the Flashback for character advancement would depend upon the nature of that outcome. Think Fallout and the CharGen of Vincent Baker's <a href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/dogs.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dogs in the Vineyard</a>.<br/><br/>My question to y'all is, are there any other examples similar to what I have described and what Vincent worked out that you can point me to? Or do you have some really cool idea(s) that you'd like to mention? I really don't have a full grasp of what will be involved in this mechanic, or even if it will fit within the game as it stands (it tends to be a more 'traditional' RPG), but I liked the idea.<br/><br/>SlaintÃ¨,<br/>Q                </div>

                            Have you seen Interrorgation, by Annie Rush? It's a very good game about an interrogation, and it alternates between the interrogation itself and a series of flashbacks to show what happened leading up to it.<br/><br/>Also have a look at Gregor Hutton's <a href="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/index.html" rel="nofollow">3:16</a> which is all about soldiers fighting a brutal future war. When you narrate a new attribute or quality (or flaw) you do so via a flashback.<br/><br/>The premise of the game sounds very interesting, keep us posted as to how it goes!                        </div>
