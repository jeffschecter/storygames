I'm 16\u2026<br/><br/>The GM says everyone starts at effectively level 1 when you first join the group. Being an inexperienced roleplayer, I didn't understand what that meant. Everyone else was effectively 10th level or higher. Which meant I spent most of the time doing nothing or failing constantly. <br/><br/>So I bribed the GM to have 1 on 1 sessions where I could catch up with the other players. Then in a game involving time travel, I went back in time and stayed there after the rest of the players traveled back to the present. Everyone was like\u2026 dude, your character is unplayable now. <br/><br/>So I met with the GM and convinced him to let me use my knowledge of the present to invent the death star, become rich, and kept myself perpetually alive by turning into cyborg. I explained that logic demanded that by the time it was the present again, I should be level 20. The other players protested but the GM caved in! It was ridiculous. I was ridiculous. I was so annoyed that they wouldn't let me start at the same level as the rest of the group that I used time travel to become more powerful than everyone combined. <br/><br/>By that point I was mad with power and convinced the GM that if there is a Light and Dark side of the force\u2026 there should be a Grey side! And I wanted to be the first Grey Side Jedi! Which of course meant that I could have both Light and Dark side powers and to stay true to the Grey\u2026 I just had to balance every good act with an evil act. <br/><br/>Granted, I was 16\u2026 but I was ridiculous!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325165/#Comment_325165" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T14:14:19+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  2:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>but I was ridiculous!</blockquote>\nRidiculously <i>awesome.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325167/#Comment_325167" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T14:19:16+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  2:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what it is about Star Wars.

I'm 19\u2026<br/><br/>We just spent the last 2 years playing superhero games which was fun. The group decided they wanted to start a game they used to play when they were younger\u2026 Shadowrun. It sounded like we were going to play sociopaths who were willing to kill anyone for money. I was not into that at all. I liked playing good characters who made the world a better place. And it seemed everyone was fetishizing the Cannon Companion sourcebook. The game seemed like an excuse to revel in gun porn. Which I was not into. I should have just not played the game. It was clear everyone wanted what I didn't but I still desired to hang out with my friends. <br/><br/>So they let me play a hacker. Which meant I got to do nothing for 2 hours when combat started (and combat was sloooow\u2026 2 hours was probably 4 rounds of combat). And when it was my turn to do something cool, because the hacking rules were so confusing the GM ruled that I would resolve all hacking with a single roll. Which meant my spotlight time was 10 minutes while everyone else had fun for hours. So it became clear that violence in this game was the only way to have fun.<br/><br/>So I made a character that could fight but would only subdue his opponents. Of course that ended up meaning\u2026 I could engage in combat but I sucked. Eventually, someone just said, "dude, just play a normal character\u2026 stop trying to fight what the game is about." I should have stopped playing but instead\u2026<br/><br/>I embraced the carnage that is Shadowrun. But I went too far. I borrowed all the books I could find and made the most broken min maxed character I could. I figured if combat was why the game was fun, I'd make the most powerful character I could to ensure I would have the most fun. And on top of that, because I couldn't relate to my character, I made them a brainwashed amnesiac killing machine so I didn't have to bother with a character background that would never come into play anyway. <br/><br/>It was ridiculous. My character was so broken, I always went first, instantly killed almost anything in 1 action, and bullets bounced off of me. I was too effective and made combat unfun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325179/#Comment_325179" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T14:56:31+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  2:56PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe I'm about to write this\u2026<br/><br/>Captain Drawback!<br/><br/>I'm 17 and we're playing DC Super Heroes. The GM says, "you can play anything you want\u2026 imagine a character concept for a new superhero or just copy any of your favorite superheroes. Then make them with X build points." <br/><br/>So I'm like\u2026 I want to play Spiderman, Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wolverine, Professor X, or Magneto! Any of these characters would be awesome! <br/><br/>Then I try to make my character\u2026 and I couldn't do it. Nothing I did with those numbers came even close to making even a C list superhero. But I wasn't the only one. Everyone was having the same problem but the more experienced players were all taking something called\u2026 drawbacks. But they had to take a lot of drawbacks\u2026 a stupid amount\u2026 to make the characters they wanted. It seemed silly to me but I was growing frustrated so I decided to experiment. <br/><br/>I took almost every drawback in the book. It was ridiculous. I just went down the list and took every single thing I could. I needed an equally ridiculous character concept\u2026<br/><br/>Captain Drawback!<br/><br/>I can't remember why I did this\u2026 but I decided I was insane due to an accident during the shooting of a Frosted Flaked commercial. You know those commercials where adults are blacked out so that they could remain anonymous while they professed their love for Tony the Tiger and sugar crusted cornflakes? My character was one of those people except it was during a live benefit show\u2026 except something went wrong\u2026 seriously wrong!<br/><br/>The silhouette / blackout / anonymous feature didn't work and everyone saw my character's identity\u2026 everyone knew he was obsessed with frosted flakes. He snapped. And Captain Drawback was born!<br/><br/>Most of his drawbacks were related to tigers or powdered cereal. But strangely I made it work! I was able to buy so many powers that I could effectively negate the danger of the majority of my drawbacks. I lost most of my powers when within a 20 foot range of frosted flakes\u2026 no problem! My unaffected teleport power got me out of danger! And on and on and ridiculously on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325182/#Comment_325182" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T15:03:35+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  3:03PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Early on I was also a problematic GM.

I, however, was bored with the spoon fed storyline and the three hour planning sessions on how to approach a problem. So I, a gnome, went into a Dwarven inn. In this setting, Dwarves had capitulated to Human rule and thereby sold out the other non-human races. So I used ventriloquism (a skill any good gnome Illusionist has, of course) to "make" the dwarves say things like "I'm a stinking traitor!" I had fun with it, hoping to stir up trouble that was actually based on the setting and touched on issues I care about.

All my friends really enjoyed the mathy character optimization stuff and tactical combat, but I was notorious for making characters that were pretty much completely unplayable in the games we were doing, since I'd give them all kinds of "useless" skills and whatnot. When I finally discovered games that were a better fit for the kind of play that I wanted, I still stuck it out for much longer than I should have - my friends were very gracious, but I'm sure it was a drag for them to see me literally falling asleep during the lengthy combats that they were really enjoying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325235/#Comment_325235" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T18:49:03+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  6:49PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachlan</cite>DM ( my wife): "You hear a woman screaming for help."<br/>Me: "I ignore it."<br/></blockquote>\nLove it. <br/><br/>I've been a problem player in that I used to agree to play games I wasn't all that interested in; when they didn't do what I liked, I would grab the plot by the balls and kick it til it fell over.<br/>Case in point: I tried out 4e D&amp;D to indulge a friend (first mistake right there...) and I was treated to a classic GM-Plot - - my half-mad zealot-priest of the Hearth Goddess (Oberon setting, fyi) jumped right in the quest-giver's face and made some pretty sharp demands about the purpose of the mission into the Dead Zone (or whatever the obliterated nation is called). <br/>The GM stared at me like I was yelling at her personally. <br/>I scaled it way back, sheepishly sort of apologized, and then we went onto the next scene... where the party's Warforged (a steampunk robot) was harassed with racial epithets by a city guard. I yelled after the guy, demanding to know the name of his superior (my cleric's assistant was the Warforged in question), and our guide to the city informed us there was no point to following up; that was just The Way Things Are 'Round Here.<br/>I grumbled, and spent the rest of the scene bored as hell while various NPCs gently chatted up the party to create rapport and whatnot; a brief post-game discussion revealed the GM's intent to start the adventure-proper during session 2. <br/>I decided life was too short, and I didn't come back to see if the story was ever going to happen; I was getting way too tetchy over just a game.

I had no way of hiding my boredom because I would just literally be sitting there with my eyes closed. I know I upset a few GMs. Luckily I'm cured now! <br/><br/>My worst problem player moments... thinking about it now makes me embarrassed... is when I called out someone for constant blatant railroading when we all promised we wouldn't do that. This description can in no way do justice to that moment. It's not what I said but the way I said it. I so badly hurt his feelings, the GM didn't run another game for anyone for at least a year after that moment. I don't even regret that I did it. But I was just way too mean. It was a bad span of 3 months where I also called out 2 other GMs for in my opinion terrible abusive railroading (I called them out in less harmful ways). In all things I am way more tactful now. And generally I don't call out anyone in the middle of a game ever now unless there is a serious, serious social problem. And if I do, I will talk to someone privately during a break. In the last 5 years I've only slipped up once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325266/#Comment_325266" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T21:06:11+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  9:06PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2011 1:21PM by orklord.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was 17, had skipped my senior year of high school and ended up playing in a D&amp;D; game at an all girls college (I got rides from the DM, who was the only other guy in the group).

He was an undead huckster who'd been alive since the Wild West named, if I recall correctly, Ace Richter.  And for three weeks prior to the campaign beginning he went on, and on, and on about how overpowered and amazing his guy was.  So at the beginning of the game, I had him have amnesia, and we began without him having any of the magical powers he'd spent all that time getting excited about.  He got them back for the last session of the yearlong campaign.  In my defense, I did center most of the campaign around friends, enemies, and unfinished business from his forgotten history (there was only one other PC, so lots of spotlight time), but I was being a dick.  I definitely cringe to think about how I made crushing his fun my campaign design priority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325323/#Comment_325323" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T08:45:14+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  8:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Also, I remember when I learned about the Big Model and completely bought into the idea that it was the One Way Forward, emailing everybody the provisional glossary and evangelizing and acting like a dick.

I ran it over a 100 times and maybe had 2 bad games. It felt like magic. So we assumed that whatever theory this game was born out of must be some sort of special secret sauce. Granted, we had no idea what that theory was talking about but we knew the results were amazing so there must be something there. We started our own theory forum to try to understand it all which ended up alienating a bunch of people who loved playing D&amp;D or who believed rules don't matter, it is the GM that makes games great. Lots of friction occurred. I knew at least 2 gaming groups that broke apart over arguing what to play, Burning Wheel or D&amp;D.  It was especially bad because we knew something we experienced was amazing but didn't have the words to explain it and pointing to forge theory articles and forum posts just confused people and gave them even more ammunition not to play the games we were excited about. <br/><br/>I remember carrying Dogs in the Vineyard and a prepared town in my backpack for a year every time I visited my old gaming group hoping at some point they would try it. They did. 2 people commented\u2026 "this games actually makes you roleplay your character."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325333/#Comment_325333" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T10:04:50+00:00" title="May 19, 2011 10:04AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worst game I ever ran...  we played the module that came with Cyberpunk and it was awesome, but for the second session I invented my own, and it was a complete railroad, and not even cyberpunky.

That wasn't really something that we did in that group all too often, so the other players and I were stoked. All of the PCs in the party were Chaotic except for one who was True Neutral, and the first potion of the campaign involved us going to a logging camp where the loggers were striking. When we got there, we were told that we were to meet with management to find a way to force the loggers back to work. Now, this was one of those instances where real world politics got in the way of gameplay, but I'm a staunch lefty and labour supporter and my friend knew it, so when we got to the picket lines I told the DM flatly, "I'm not going to cross."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"I'm not going to cross the picket lines. I'm going to sit out here in solidarity with the loggers."<br/><br/>"But you have to go."<br/><br/>"No, I don't. I'm not helping management."<br/><br/>Then we stared at each other for a couple of minutes. I'm not sure how we got back on track after that, but we managed to work around that impasse. A session or so later, a company of the Duke's troops (who were Lawful Evil) stopped us on the road to wherever we were going and demanded our loot/equipment. Being a bunch of Chaotic smartmouths who weren't likely to hand over our hard-won treasure simply because we were being shaken down by a random encounter, we told the Lieutenant to go fuck himself. The DM mentioned that there was four of us and about 20 of them.<br/><br/>"So?" I asked.

It was a DC Heroes supers game, I was playing a Rorschach-style dude named Noire (the "e" is on purpose). The other two players had more established super heroes, and we were working seperate cases, both of which were supposed to lead to the same villain with us teaming up. <br/><br/>So my guy, in civilian clothes, is tailing this villain into his nightclub where he meets with the Big Boss Man. Meanwhile, upstairs, the other two characters break into his office and find a large case full of the evidence I need to clear my name. And they were like "Huh, this isn't what we are looking for. Let's torch it!"<br/><br/>So my whole storyline goes up in imaginary smoke cause my guy ain't in the room. Meanwhile I'm absolutely seething. So when it comes my turn again, my guy, in civies, walks up to the two major villains of the campaign and says "Hi. I'm Noire. I can't prove it, but I think you screwed over my life." And then I attacked, burning through all of my Hero Points and just destroying the two villains.<br/><br/>Everyone was just glaring at me. I didn't give a rat's ass. I pretty much single handedly took down the two villains and then ran off with the cops giving chase. We didn't play the campaign again after that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325416/#Comment_325416" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T22:05:03+00:00" title="May 19, 2011 10:05PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say, many of these examples of dickishness were pretty clearly in response to dickishness.

A new friend was trying out RPGs for the first time. We played Shadowrun. At some point we're standing outside an electrical fence. <br/><br/>I say "I push him into the fence!"<br/><br/>He's completely astounded, his character takes appropriate damage, I'm like "I have no idea why I did that". I still don't, really. Probably some social angst with a random panicky impulse I didn't control. <br/><br/>We became good friends later, though I don't think we ever played another RPG together.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This was when I was about 15, I think. I was the oldest player in the group, so I got to boss the others around a lot, I guess. The GM was the guy in the group with the lowest status, and he'd make up some really boring dungeons (sorry, but it's true) - long corridors with a zillion doors, and some humanoids behind each door with random amounts of treasure.<br/><br/>We start the scenario with the standard opening: "You're on a road going north!" We knew this would lead straight to the dungeon entrance, of course; dungeons are to the north, always.<br/><br/>So I say "We go south." Which we did.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Same group, same GM. My 18th level Magic-User, "Furious Anger", was so powerful I decided to retire him. In one of the first scenarios after that, our (new) party decides to attack a town - I forget why. We argue with the GM, come up with plans to break through every defence. Then the GM says: "There's an old magic-user who uses his last Wish spell to protect the city!"<br/><br/>I say "No he doesn't! Furious Anger won't let him!"<br/><br/>I think we actually got away with it, and took over the town. By sheer social contract fuckedupness, really. I think we gave that poor guy hell when he was GMing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325441/#Comment_325441" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T04:41:39+00:00" title="May 20, 2011  4:41AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of a wizard named Furious Anger.

This left the group drifting with no backup and resources, having burned our bridges with our former allies in a truly dickish fashion (initiated by me) and completely negated weeks of GM world building and plotting.<br/><br/>Worse party-hostile act:  During an ill-thought-out 12 player session of Marvel Super Heroes (the cool old Saga card driven one) it took 45 minutes of real time for my character to cross a room because two players were being spotlight hogs.  My PTSD-suffering Vietnam-Era Cybernetic Soldier decided to flashback and started wasting other members of the team, blew up the McGuffin and then fled to resume his previous career as a super villain called Flag Burner.  Being as I had the most twinked and combat focused character, I managed to whore out my telekinetic attacks into a combo (we were fighting under an ICBM, I ripped open the fuel tanks and detonated the resulting deluge) that killed two team members and crippled one, leaving us with ONE regular character (everyone else was visiting and playing walk-ons) and a pissed off player group.

The GM was incredibly heavily invested in his intricately designed world, with multiple branching continuities and weekly real-time news updates and stuff, it was actually a beautiful thing that he had meticulously constructed, and the game we were currently involved in was heading towards a big climax that was a nicely traditional superhero team arc, where we were about to break big-time. Without getting into minutia, he presented us with an offer that wasn't meant to be a choice, it was the next chapter of the story. My character turned it down, and talked the other PCs into going along with him. The GM was completely stunned, didn't see it coming, literally said "OK, well, you... broke the game. I'll need a few weeks to figure something out." and we quit in the middle of the session. I played only a few more games before he went 'on hiatus' with the game, eventually restarting it a few months later without letting me know. The argument can be made that I wasn't being a dick, but it was a situation where it was CLAR at the table that I was breaking hard against where the game was heading, and I took a probably needless stand 'on principle' when I should have trusted him to let me have character bits that worked into the new paradigm. When someone gets that upset, if you're empathetic, you don't just shrug and say 'welp, that's rough, but it's what my character'd do...' you try to work out a reasonable compromise, you talk out the issue. We didn't, really, and it wrecked what had been up until then a pretty cool game.<br/><br/>The other time was recently, when I got involved in a group (and a DM) whose play style was not really entirely compatible with mine. But this was at a time where I was JUST starting to do gaming outside the store after many years of concentrating almost solely on gaming to build the business, so I was bound and determined to stick with it, because I needed to 'get used' to gaming outside my 'comfort zone'. So I stubbornly stuck with it, even as I came home from games doing significantly more complaining than nerd-wanking to my wife afterwards. She was the one who convinced me to bow out, and I think the DM was happy he didn't have to ask me to stop coming because the style was not really a good fit for me. <br/><br/>Sometimes, it's not an attitude problem or even cluelessness, sometimes it's just the determination to have fun even if it makes you miserable trying.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325624/#Comment_325624" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-21T10:12:56+00:00" title="May 21, 2011 10:12AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scramble</cite>Chris' mercenary troop could have busted out of jail, maybe with help from the workers, and could have fought for REVOLUTION!

Actually, as I recollect, the initial robbing came after a demand from the Lieutenant to submit to his authoritah and do something or other. When we refused that, then they tried to rob us and almost killed us. It wasn't the case of the GM trying to provide desperate challenges for our party to overcome; it was the GM trying to get us to submit and do things against our characters wishes and then escalating when we wouldn't accede. Probably would have worked better if we were a lawful good party.
