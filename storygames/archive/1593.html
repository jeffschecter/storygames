                    So ... something I often say is that Misery Bubblegum isn't one of those dirty hippy games.  It has a GM, and the GM narrates the outcomes of conflicts.  Players have characters, and they're the ones in charge of those characters.  Get a haircut and a job, you freaks!<br/><br/>Well.<br/><br/>I've also got all these wonderfully juicy internal conflicts, like "Where do I belong?" and "Why do I hurt people?" and stuff like that.  And I <b>know</b> that they can sing, because I've seen them sing ... but here's the thing:  They only seem to sing when I break the rules I list above.<br/><br/>How do I know?  Here's my evidence:  In first games with people (where I'm serious about the "Let's not be dirty hippies!") internal conflicts often go unresolved from lack of interest, or resolve early in the game to make way for (usually) relationship conflicts.  In second games with the same people (when I forget that we're not hippies) internal conflicts resolve late in the game with high amounts of interest.<br/><br/>So here's my hypothesis, backed by that evidence and decades of anecdotal instinct:  Any conflict is only fun when everyone around the table has the tools to get involved in it.  Internal conflicts <b>require</b> hippy techniques in order to be fun for the whole table.<br/><br/>Specifically:  Imagine I'm playing Lenny, and Lenny has an internal conflict "Why don't I stand up for myself?"  We're not playing a dirty hippy game, and so I always get to decide whether Lenny stands up for himself or not.  I play Lenny, I get him into a conflict about whether he gets beaten up by bullies, we roll and I lose.  I decide not to have him stand up for himself, and he gets beaten up.<br/><br/>Nobody.  Else.  Cares.  Why?  Because they had no input.<br/><br/>Now, compare:  I'm playing Lenny, but we're dirty hippies.  If I lose this conflict then someone else gets to tell me what the character <i>feels</i>.  Not necessarily what he does, but what he feels.  I lose the conflict with the bullies.  I decide that Lenny will stick up for himself (even knowing that the bullies are destined to beat him down).  The winning player tells me that they beat Lenny into the dirt and furthermore that Lenny is filled with shame that he's not man enough to protect himself.  If he can't do that, how could he ever protect the girl he loves?  He couldn't!<br/><br/>Suddenly, everyone cares.  Why?  Because they had input.  They got to add specifics (in improv terms, <i>heighten</i> in both details and emotion) to the nature of Lenny's internal conflict.  They got to narrow down the arena in which it will play out.<br/><br/>So ... implications!<br/><br/>External conflicts don't need anyone to have input on anything other than what's happening.  They should be resolved at the furthest point from hippiedom ... GM narrates what happens, players play their characters, yadda yadda.<br/><br/>Relationship conflicts are more fun when people are able to modify the relationship in a meaningful way.  I <i>think</i> that means that when you win a conflict where someone else has relationship stakes you should be able to modify (read carefully now!) what <i>they</i> think the <i>other person</i> thinks <i>about them</i>.  Not what they think about themselves, or what they think about the other person, but what they think the other person thinks.  If I lose a conflict of "Lenny loves Mary" then Mary's player gets to tell me that Lenny thinks Mary thinks he's a weakling.<br/><br/>Internal conflicts are more fun when people are able to modify the internal stakes in a meaningful way.  I <i>think</i> that means that when you win a cnoflict where someone else has internal stakes you should be able to modify what they think about themselves.  Not what they do, not what they think about other people, but what they think about themselves.<br/><br/>It's a sliding scale of hippiedom, and it is established when you first offer those conflicts!  If you don't want somebody to tell you what your character thinks about himself then you simply do not offer forth an internal conflict.  You aren't comfortable with the techniques that are required in order to make it fun for other people.  That's cool.  You probably do a <b>rockin'</b> job with external conflicts, so go there!<br/><br/>Likewise, if you don't feel comfortable playing a character <i>without</i> that sort of group input then you don't offer external conflicts.  You aren't comfortable with the techniques needed to make that fun for other people, so you just don't do it.<br/><br/>So what do people think of this?  Do you think I'm right about what techniques are needed to make what types of conflicts sing?  Do you think it's sane to offer a sliding scale within the same game?  Do you think that the very idea is judgmental and arrogant, saying "Oh, well, if <i>all you can handle</i> is external conflicts I suppose we can find a minor role for you on the periphery of our great artistry"?                </div>

                            First off, I loved the quick M-B game I was in at Nerdly. But the point of this post is to sadly inform you, Tony, that your game is to my view 100% dirty hippie. How do I know? I know because I didn't have a character sheet - I had 2 awesome cards with paper clips on them in front of me.                        </div>

                            Nice.  You are definitely onto something here.  This makes so much sense and seems so natural that in retrospect, it seems like a "Well, duh!" sort of moment even though at the time it was anything but.<br/><br/>I think the observation that people can play the conflict types they are most comfortable with is very powerful.   Far from arrogant, it is the opposite.  People can do what works for them and offer appropriate input into other players' characters in terms of what each player is interested in.  This also discourages the kind of projection you see in games where people give the sort of input to other players in terms of what he or she would want instead of what the other player wants.<br/><br/>The only caveat is that you need the proper mix of issues on the table as a whole.  If everyone wants to do only external issues, for example, you have a problem.  Nothing can match up for conflicts.  The question is do you want to accept this as a limitation or change the rules to make it possible to match conflicts of similar type?<br/><br/>- Eric Sedlacek                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>Yes, I generally agree, but...<br/><br/>Firstly, is there really such a clear division between internal and external? What happens with conflicts like "Why do I always cry when threatened?" or "Why don't I frighten him so he runs away?".<br/><br/>Secondly - and here's the hippie bit - why wouldn't group input work with external conflicts too? I agree that, generally, external conflicts can be fun without group input, but they'd also be fun if, say, you got to say <i>how</i> I was hurt in a fight.<br/><br/>And on your specific questions...
<blockquote>Do you think I'm right about what techniques are needed to make what types of conflicts sing?</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>Do you think it's sane to offer a sliding scale within the same game?</blockquote>
Yes, except for some doubts as to whether some conficts are internal and external.
<blockquote>Do you think that the very idea is judgmental and arrogant, saying "Oh, well, if<i>all you can handle</i>is external conflicts I suppose we can find a minor role for you on the periphery of our great artistry"?</blockquote>
Not in the least. You're giving different tools and letting players choose which to use. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Kurly:  I'm still exhausted from Camp Nerdly, and I'm fuzzy-headed.  I think that's why I'm not understanding what you're saying.  Can you give a quick example?  Maybe if I can connect it to the events of play (even fictional play) I'll be better able to put two and two together.<br/><br/>Graham:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>What happens with conflicts like "Why do I always cry when threatened?" or "Why don't I frighten him so he runs away?".</blockquote>Misery Bubblegum doesn't really <i>have</i> those kinds of conflicts.  The conflicts are things that are going to run most of the (short) session, so they're more general.  Questions like "Why do I always cry when threatened?" come out in play when (for instance) you stake "Why don't I stick up for myself?" and the GM stakes "Your world is under attack" and the result is that you break down and flee combat (or whatever).<br/><br/>As for the group input on externals ... I think that I'm saying, <i>yeah</i>, winning the conflict gives you some authority over what happens even in an external conflict.  But it only gives you authority over the external things.  If you win a conflict about "A crime has been committed" then you can say that Lori is carted off to prison for her heinous crime, but you <b>cannot</b> say that (for instance) she thinks of herself as a bad person, because that's not an external stake.<br/><br/>And, like I said, fuzzy-headed.  So if I've missed your point, please be patient with me :-)                        </div>

                            Tony, are there any mechanical reinforcement/reward systems that encourage players to interact with each other regarding their internal conflicts?  Like, if you've got the "Why don't I stick up for myself?" is there anything in it for me to bully you or to make some crack about your lack of a spine, or to encourage you to stand up to the bullies next time?                        </div>

                            JBR:  Right now there are a lot of things which give <i>partial</i> motivation (it's dice-trading, so if you get me into a conflit then you get my dice, and some other stuff) but nothing that says "This is what you are <i>supposed to be doing</i> in this system."<br/><br/>That may be because I'm not sure it's always what the players are supposed to be doing.

                            Kurly:  Gotcha.  Okay.  You're talking about breaking the perceptual things from the external conflict.  But what about when the explicit stakes of the conflict are internal?<br/><br/>Like, in Misery Bubblegum, you'd probably be seeing Groo put up (say) "Relationship:  You don't respect me" and the GM (for the maiden) putting up (say) "External:  Your actions reflect on others" to represent Groo's folly and how it makes everyone think less of his companion, Rufferto.<br/><br/>If Groo loses that conflict, and blithely continues thinking that the maiden is totally enchanted by him then Amos has basically cheated the explicit stakes of the conflict.  He's taking the damage externally, but not internally.<br/><br/>So yeah, I do think we're probably talking about the same thing, but in a different way.  You're looking at resolving how people perceive things (the Reactions) through a parallel set of rules.  I'm looking at resolving those perceptions with the same rules, but with different switches flipped:  If you're resolving an External conflict you use the rules with some valves closed tight, but if it's an Internal conflict then you use the same rules but with those valves wide open.  But fundamentally, yeah ... same thing.<br/><br/>Thanks for clarifying!<br/><br/>I ... will have to think about the whole issue of Perceptual Accuracy.  It's a wierd term for what you're saying.  It seems to me that with a higher PA score the character's reactions are likely (in many cases) to be <b>less</b> accurate than otherwise.  If I, as a player, have the opportunity to throw my character into complete denial rather than have him face an uncomfortable defeat, why wouldn't I do that?  I would expect the other players to be winning conflicts purely in order to force my character to see the TRUTH, not to confuse him with lies.<br/><br/>But the idea of giving players the ability to hold the reins of character-control more or less tightly ... that's an idea I like.  I theorize (as above) that players whose characters have high PAs would <b>not</b> be able to tell stories about their character's internal turmoil in a way that would keep other players interested, whereas players whose characters have low PAs would be able to, simply because the other players would have more potential to be involved.  What do you think?                        </div>

                            Rules thought:  Right now, everybody in the game starts with the same number of their dice on the table, all (starting) in their own control.  Dice that go to other people indicate that the other people can later have emotional impact on that player's character.<br/><br/>What if you do this?<br/><br/>Each player starts with ... say ... nine dice in their color.<br/><br/>For each card that you add to the table (in prep-time) you dump some dice into a pool at the center of the table:<br/>  - External:  Add three dice of the GM's color.<br/>  - Relationship:  Add two dice of the color of the player who added the card, and one of the player of the other character in the relationship.<br/>  - Internal:  Add three dice of your color.<br/><br/>After all the cards are added, people take turns pulling a die from the pool to add to their own.  Maybe they'll steal back theirs.  Maybe they'll hunt the dice of other people.  Whatever they do, the dice will end up a <i>little bit</i> shaken up.  Maybe it would jumpstart the game.                        </div>

                            I think that would be a marvellous jumpstart, Tony.  Would you connect something in-fiction to the act of picking out dice from that center pool?  Stuff like "and my character saw you turn into a werewolf last full moon?"                        </div>

                            Hrm ... start each session with a "Last time on Misery Bubblegum" made from whole cloth?  That's a thought.<br/><br/>Or maybe make the picking out of dice into something that people do <i>during the game</i>.  Like, each player gets to pick out a die each scene, until the dice run out.                        </div>
