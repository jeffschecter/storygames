Should I try to encourage the GMs at my club to tweak their games (typically WoD and PF etc.) so they become more palatable to me (indifying my trad, or in this case other people's), or should I drastically revise down my expectations and change my preferred playstyle, i.e. learn to be less indy and more trad (tradify my indy)?

My partner is a trad gamer who basically refuses to play the way I play and the games I play. <br/><br/>I think you should offer to run something as has already been suggested but also prepare yourself for it not to work. I ran Monsterhearts for my partner's group a year and a bit ago and it fell flat. They refused to split up, refused to work against each other, and wouldn't take on any hook that didn't involve all of them at once. In hindsight, this game was a terrible choice even though it seemed on the surface to be very similar to World of Darkness. <br/><br/>MH and many other storygames require players to manufacture content. Many players will freeze when asked to do this and I've found that quite a few then whinge about an immersion break when they are forced to metagame or think out of character stance.<br/><br/>All you can do here is try. I'm tempted to recommend Fiasco. You can't play Fiasco with any trad style baggage and it is pick up and play which makes it IMO a useful barometer for further experimentation without much work on your part.  <br/><br/>Good luck! <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426501/#Comment_426501" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T17:31:32+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  5:31PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, I agree with Fiasco and Lady Blackbird.

I recommend being quite explicit about ways that things are different and to make an active effort to habit break as appropriate.<br/><br/>My Apocalypse World game fell a bit flat because the players felt like it was their job to cooperate with each other.  The monsterhearts game we ran right afterword worked better because players were in eachother's business and at eachother's throats.  It can be really helpful to say, quite explicitly, "I know you guys are used to having the party stick together.  But that's not what this game is about.  There is no party--you can act at cross purposes and it will make the game better, not worse"<br/><br/>With fiasco, the issue is pacing.  characters used to combat, skill checks, and long negotiations will have trouble with the scene pacing structure of games like fiasco.  Fiasco in particular because players are either supposed to shape the first half or the second half of the scene, but there's a subconcious tendency for everyone to shape a whole scene.  I recommend bringing a timer to your first game, and explicitly timing the setup and the results separately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426506/#Comment_426506" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T20:08:03+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  8:08PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience:<br/><br/>* Show, display, and demonstrate other styles of gaming, other games, other techniques, but without being pushy. It's not a conflict of "trad" vs. "indie", it's just you showing people what's out there, neither better nor worse.<br/><br/>You might offer to run a session (or more) of a particular game. You might say, "Hey, here's a cool technique I like to use as GM. What do you think of that?" You might relegate more authority for certain things to your players when GMing a trad game. You might bring a Fiasco playset and show it to some people, or the Lady Blackbird booklet, or whatever you're excited about, before or after the game (but without distracting from it). And so on.<br/><br/>One good technique is to say that you're running a bit of a more oddball game and invite everyone, then see who shows interest.<br/><br/>* Try to find what makes a particular game that's NOT in line with your preferences cool. Is there a set plot on rails, while the characters try to have cool accents and be badass? Then ask yourself: "Can I accept what I cannot change, and find the fun or the challenge in this other thing?" Join that game, accept that the plot is something you will experience passively, and put your character-acting skills to the test!<br/><br/>If the game is all about clever character builds, then ask your fellow gamers what they're excited about and what their tricks are, then make it a challenge for yourself to come up with a better one, a more badass, optimized character.<br/><br/>If the game is about crazy risks and just trying to survive, adopt that mindset and jump into the fray.<br/><br/>If you still can't enjoy the game, have a chat with the GM and/or group (depending on the game and play culture) and ask whether they're open to adding something or taking something away. If they resist, gracefully say that it was nice playing with them, but this game is not quite what you were looking for, and bow out.<br/><br/>But don't try to force people to change, and don't play a game while secretly (or openly) grumbling that you wish it was something else.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426507/#Comment_426507" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T20:09:28+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  8:09PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My strategy for this has been to run semi-regular one-offs of various indie games, and inviting a mix of my regular players and other friends (this doubles as a great way to introduce curious newbies to RPGs in general). Some go better than others, but they're always fun and low pressure, and the influence of indie/hippie/story-game styles of play have definitely trickled into my trad groups, one of which was super excited to do a whole chapter of our PF campaign using Dungeon World, and another of which has wholesale converted from Heavy Gear to Chris Perrin's Mecha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426513/#Comment_426513" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T23:40:04+00:00" title="January  2, 2014 11:40PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2014 11:41PM by Rickard.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about playing neotradional games, that has influence from indie gaming but still stands in traditional ground of playing? That's usually how I "convert" people into dirty hippie games.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of games that has a game master but has a high level of player influence. Games like <b>Feng Shui</b>, <b>InSpectres</b>, <b>Lady Blackbird</b> and I guess (without having read any of the *W games) <b>Dungeon World</b>. The thing is, if you take a game like Feng Shui, you can probably push some more techniques into that game without it being part of the game.

Given those options, I would suggest a mix of both.  <br/><br/>1a) Pitch an indie game to a GM.  I would recommend an easy-to-learn 1-shot.  <i>Fiasco</i> qualifies, but is also a radical departure from traditional resolution, so <i>Lady Blackbird</i> might be an easier change of pace.  Something tightly constrained, like <i>Penny For My Thoughts</i> with its narration prompts, might also be a nice alternative.  If the group likes more crunch and rules traction, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is an option, though you'd need a more hard-working GM.<br/><br/>1b) If your club GMs don't want to run weird new games, then you can instead suggest your favorite indie techniques be ported into trad games.  Fanmail, metagame Fate/Hero/Story points for rerolls, flashback/recoup scenes, tracking relationships and folding them into rolls, giving players moments of authority over specific chunks of world/plot/backstory -- all of these can easily be tacked onto most trad games.  I have a friend who runs an entire track of "D&amp;D with a little indie" at cons.  All you need to do is identify an overlap between the stuff you like and the stuff that'll sound good to the GM.  <br/><br/>I recall folks telling me that the GM technique of "I need to do a thing to the story or your character now, but here are some points in return, which you can later use for important stuff" has been an easy sell.<br/><br/>2) Trad games often contain multitudes, so see if you can find an aspect within them that you like, and if so, push for play to emphasize that.  As a player, I've certainly turned dungeon crawls with a side of intrigue into intrigue with a side of dungeon crawling.  This is extremely dependent on the group, though, so if you and the other players have completely different taste, it might be a lost cause.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426522/#Comment_426522" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-03T07:09:50+00:00" title="January  3, 2014  7:09AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your responses guys- all good stuff.

When you're playing a trad game, be the best player you can be at the table by your groups standards, and pick and choose the times to make your pitches for "indieness." <br/><br/>I think you may find it more productive to just eliminate the phrase "trad games"  from the dialogue here, World of Darkness and Pathfinder don't have much in common actually and a fan of either could be a bit miffed to have them lumped together willy nilly. <br/><br/>Think about what they like about trad games and pick indie games that provide that. Running is probably the best approach (or picking a GMless game and facillitating). Offering games like Fiasco or Microscope as options for pickup gaming can also be a useful tactic.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426529/#Comment_426529" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-03T07:46:30+00:00" title="January  3, 2014  7:46AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco is what I had the most sucess with myself.

Something tightly constrained, like <i>Penny For My Thoughts</i> with its narration prompts, might also be a nice alternative.  If the group likes more crunch and rules traction, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is an option, though you'd need a more hard-working GM.</blockquote>Fiasco and Lady Blackbird are both great games, but neither is one I would suggest handing to someone else and asking them to run it.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird's rules are one page long, so they don't spend much time telling the GM what to do.  I facilitated Fiasco "cold", but the only reason I was able to do that is because I'm a (half) trained screenwriter.  I knew what to look for in terms of pacing and story escalation.  If someone's only previous GMing experience is Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there's a solid chance that the game will get long and rambley.<br/><br/>I'd say MonsterHearts and Apocalypse World are both pretty great at teaching the GM to run with no previous playing experience.

Trad games are usually very open for different kinds of playstyles within the group. You can have the tactical person and the immersive one playing the same game, but experiences different kinds of fun while doing it.<br/><br/>The only thing that trad is doing less well, is how it is restrictive on the players' influence. There are ways to go around this, by talking to your game master to make your character more a part of the story or by optimizing the character in such a way that you, in a way, can treat that area of expertise as your domain in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426582/#Comment_426582" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-03T17:38:06+00:00" title="January  3, 2014  5:38PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            catty_big,<br/><br/>It's a pretty natural place to be in, and we've all been there. (In the city where I live, there's a huge gaming community organized through Meetup.com, and I've given up on interacting with them because they have a very specific approach to gaming I don't like. For example, I've had people tell me, "It's an indie game! That means the rules don't matter!" So I do very little gaming. I'd rather play and have fun occasionally than waste lots of time playing games and feeling unsatisfied, and that's OK by me. Quality over quantity.)<br/><br/>You should keep in mind that you expecting a bunch of gamers somewhere to be familiar with certain games or styles of play isn't entirely reasonable. It doesn't reflect on them as people in either case. They may be awesome gamers and good friends, or not, either way.<br/><br/>Here, I'll try to offer practical advice!<br/><br/>Things which have worked for me:<br/><br/>1. Only run games, don't play them. <br/><br/>There are lots of games which have cool "indie" stuff in them but it's not strictly "visible" to the players. You can play something like Apocalypse World or The Shadow of Yesterday (or even Dogs in the Vineyard) with 'trad' players who don't realize they're doing anything different. (On a sidenote, while there are fanatics on both/all sides, most people just think of games as games and don't see these lines at all. They just play a game and they like it or they don't! No point trying to make them take sides by labeling it as belonging in one camp but not another.)<br/><br/>A simple example: play D&amp;D, but ask the players to set important goals for their characters, and tell them that it's a major source of XP in your game. When the player says, "I want to kill the Duke of Westerness!", you say, "Cool, that's worth 5000 XP. Pull it off, and you get 5,000 XPs." To the players, it will feel like D&amp;D. To the GM, it feels very different: you're not writing a "plot" anymore, but prepping in reaction to the players' ideas.<br/><br/>Another example: <br/><br/>I sometimes prep for games as a GM by setting myself a challenge. It goes like this:<br/><br/>I don't get to do any prep (beyond a basic outline of premise/setting) until the characters have been made, including not just stats but also as much as I can get - backgrounds, histories, beliefs, relationships, etc.<br/><br/>Now, I can start to do some prep. But! I'm not allowed to create *anything* that's not coming directly from, or closely related to, something a player came up with. I can't create new material of my own -- that's not allowed!<br/><br/>So, for instance, I don't have a villain in mind, I don't create one. I wait for the players to describe their characters. If someone writes a backstory where they were abandoned by their stepfather when the war broke out... now I have a potential bad guy, and something about a war (I can ask for more details: "Whose side was your stepfather on? Are they still around?"). Then I use those elements to create something - this is now the direction for the campaign.<br/><br/>2. When you play games, find the fun in games which are not normally to your liking. Embrace the fun of min-maxing or dungeon crawling or railroading (or whatever), and play with that. Just like you wouldn't sit down to a game of Chess expecting a dramatic masterpiece with a plot reversal... know what you're in for and play that when you feel like it. Appreciate it for what it is, and don't bring in other expectations! Leave those for other games or other groups.<br/><br/>3. Find ways to see which players share some interests with you. Invite them to play something unusual, see who shows up. Start a bi-weekly "experiments in gaming" club, where you take turns running one-shots. Host a dinner party where you try out a new game. And so on. Chat with people about what they liked and what they didn't, what excites them, that kind of thing. You'll see who's interested and who's not.<br/><br/>You won't get as much by talking or debating - people get riled up about terms like "trad" and "indie" - but just play a game with them and you'll see their actual reaction, instead of some ingrained response.<br/><br/>4. Some of my best experiences have been playing with non-gamers. No like-minded gamers around? Then find like-minded people first, then see if they're potentially interested in some games.<br/><br/>I game with people whose company I enjoy, and who are friends, creative, and fun. I start them with something easy and light which excites them, without too much explanation. "Hey, you guys want to try an unusual kind of game on Friday night? I'll make some snacks, come over at 8pm."<br/><br/>Keep it simple and short, and you'll see if they want more. Eventually you'll have your own gaming scene.<br/><br/>5. More and more people are playing online. If your local crowd is completely unsatisfying for you, post here (or wherever, G+ is good for this, for example) and find some people who want to play these games over Skype or Hangouts. There are lots! You could easily find people to play a game a week or something similar. There used to be something called "Play Now!" on Story Games... it might be still around, or over on G+.<br/><br/>6. You could also try online gaming communities, like Meetups or conventions, gaming clubs, game stores, local Universities (which often have a gamer's club), game design groups, G+ groups, and so on. They'll help you hook up with someone in your area.<br/><br/>Just posting, "Hey, I live in such-and-such-a-place. Is there anyone here in this area?", can be really helpful. Try it here on S-G, try it on any other forum/site/social media thing, and you'll probably find someone with similar interests.<br/><br/>These are not in order of preference; just a bunch of things you can try! <br/><br/>Good luck in any case, and let us know how it goes! I used to entertain my friends in New York by sending them e-mail accounts of horrible gaming experiences I had in the place where I live now. It made it a little more fun: instead of just being frustrating, it turned into a funny journal kind of experience and gave me an excuse to explore my own preferences and to stay in touch with friends!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426599/#Comment_426599" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T09:37:54+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  9:37AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I propose you adopt the term "trippy" to describe whatever solution you find. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>\nThis.\n<blockquote>Just say "hey, I want to play this game, who is interested and who can make it on Wednesday at 7?"

Your mileage may vary, of course - if your group is used to games being quite player-led and not relying on the GM to come up with all the ideas or push them towards the plot then you'll probably do better than we would have done. <br/><br/>The game we made the transition with was <i>Always/Never/Now</i>, which ironically is a hack of LB, but does a couple of things in a much more trad-familiar way. There's a nice big rule book for the GM, explaining the same system in more detail, and with a small extra rule surrounding assigning difficulties to take down opponents that made my . It's got a largely set plot and predetermined things that can happen so the players don't need to come up with everything, but they choose the order they run the scenes in and all of them are open ended, so it's effectively got a very transparent railroad that doesn't remove player agency. It's also got a bit more attention paid to numerical balance between characters, which was vital to appease the rules lawyers in my trad-y group. <br/><br/>If you're going to try to convince someone else to run something for you to play in, A/N/N might be an easier sell, and I definitely felt more comfortable with it as a brand new story game GM than I would have with LB.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426680/#Comment_426680" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T13:36:01+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  1:36PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2014 7:30PM by catty_big.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, here are my thoughts following the posts so far (warning: text-heavy).<br/><br/>First of all, if you don\u2019t see the problem, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re lucky enough not to have experienced it, in which case I can\u2019t explain it any more or better than I have here. <br/><br/>Speaking to some specific comments: \n<blockquote>I propose you adopt the term "trippy" to describe whatever solution you find. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>Lol! \n<blockquote>I ran Monsterhearts for my partner's group a year and a bit ago and it fell flat. They refused to split up, refused to work against each other, and wouldn't take on any hook that didn't involve all of them at once. In hindsight, this game was a terrible choice even though it seemed on the surface to be very similar to World of Darkness. <br/><br/>MH and many other storygames require players to manufacture content. Many players will freeze when asked to do this and I've found that quite a few then whinge about an immersion break when they are forced to metagame or think out of character stance.</blockquote>\nI think you\u2019ve nailed the biggest problem here, which is that of differing playstyles and player expectations. If they\u2019re used to trad player parties then something like MH is unlikely to work.<br/><br/>To the solution of weaning them with game x, y or z, I think the best option is some sort of \u2018trindie\u2019 game, i.e. one which at least nods to traditional stats, and has player party elements, of which the most obvious candidate would be something FATE-based, probably Dresden Files, as it has both supernatural and investigative elements likely to appeal to a trad audience.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Horn_head_o">@Horn_head_o</a> and others who have suggested games like Lady Blackbird, which has enough of a party dynamic but pushes the envelope, and yet not in a scary way, yes, I agree, likewise Feng Shui and almost anything run off PDQ. I think jumping into the deep end with GMless games like Fiasco would carry an enormous risk: it would <i>either</i>blow their minds and totally convert them at a stroke (even if they end up having one!) <i>or</i> so put them off such games that they never try any ever again.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> Yes, Dungeon World is also an obvious choice, although I would slightly worry about being accused of bad faith by players signing up on the basis of the game being a standard \u2018kill them, take their stuff\u2019-style dungeon bash then finding that it was more like \u2018hippy weirdassery\u2019, and to illustrate this problem, and the extent of my club\u2019s overall tradness, here\u2019s an anecdote. Last year I was playing in a game of, I can\u2019t remember, Dragon Age maybe? For a while we were having a good solid chunk of what I call ICR (in-character roleplaying, i.e. where the PCs interact with each other and develop their character through roleplaying, with no little or no combat.) when I heard one of the players on the other side of the table whispering to his neighbour \u2018All this roleplaying\u2019s all very well, but I want to kill things.\u2019 \n<blockquote>The opening post claims the two options are to (1) encourage GMs or (2) adjust preferences.  Given those options, I would suggest a mix of both.  <br/><br/>1b) If your club GMs don't want to run weird new games, then you can instead suggest your favorite indie techniques be ported into trad games.  Fanmail, metagame Fate/Hero/Story points for rerolls, flashback/recoup scenes, tracking relationships and folding them into rolls, giving players moments of authority over specific chunks of world/plot/backstory -- all of these can easily be tacked onto most trad games.  I have a friend who runs an entire track of "D&amp;D with a little indie" at cons.  All you need to do is identify an overlap between the stuff you like and the stuff that'll sound good to the GM.  <br/><br/>2) Trad games often contain multitudes, so see if you can find an aspect within them that you like, and if so, push for play to emphasize that.  As a player, I've certainly turned dungeon crawls with a side of intrigue into intrigue with a side of dungeon crawling.  This is extremely dependent on the group, though, so if you and the other players have completely different taste, it might be a lost cause.</blockquote>\nI like the idea of \u2018D&amp;D with a little indie\u2019: I think this could be a good way of weaning, as opposed to converting the unfaithful with the shock and awe of games like Penny which, trust me, would ensure that I never got any sign-ups ever again.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the games I could most see myself doing this however would be not D&amp;D but WoD (specifically Changeling, Mage and Wraith). Surprised? Don\u2019t be. Storyteller was originally supposed to be like d20 but with a more narrative flavour, but most GMs these days treat it as just another combat system, rendering it utterly pointless. Forex, last year I was in C:tL three-weeker, and I was really looking forward to some hippy style introspection about what it meant to be a Changeling, especially after escaping Arcadia, but sadly the GM used it as just another opportunity to do his repertoire of quirky NPCs (complete with funny voices) and have us prepare for a big player party vs Big Bad combat scene. Uh.  <br/><br/>So yeah, I\u2019d take something like C:tL and make it into more of a storygame, while keeping most of the dice rolling ad having at least <i>some</i> combat (without which I \u2018d end up with the no sign-ups ever again scenario as above).<br/><br/>In like vein, this from Paul_T:\n<blockquote> Show, display, and demonstrate other styles of gaming, other games, other techniques, but without being pushy. It's not a conflict of "trad" vs. "indie", it's just you showing people what's out there, neither better nor worse.</blockquote>\nAnd within that is a point which probably casts me in a bad light: all through this discussion I\u2019ve been talking about trad vs indie/hippy, which is bad because a) it suggests there is a black and white, Manichaean \u2018Good\u2019 vs \u2018Bad\u2019 dichotomy in gameplay and game design- which is clearly not the case- and b) I\u2019m \u2018right\u2019 and they\u2019re \u2018wrong\u2019 (no need to spell out what\u2019s bad about that).<br/><br/>More from Paul_T:\n<blockquote>Try to find what makes a particular game that's NOT in line with your preferences cool. Is there a set plot on rails, while the characters try to have cool accents and be badass? Then ask yourself: "Can I accept what I cannot change, and find the fun or the challenge in this other thing?" Join that game, accept that the plot is something you will experience passively, and put your character-acting skills to the test!<br/><br/>If the game is all about clever character builds, then ask your fellow gamers what they're excited about and what their tricks are, then make it a challenge for yourself to come up with a better one, a more badass, optimized character.<br/><br/>If the game is about crazy risks and just trying to survive, adopt that mindset and jump into the fray.</blockquote>\nThis is the third option, the \u2018And do I want to?\u2019 of the OP. i.e don\u2019t try to change what I cannot change, but make the best of a bad job, and\u2026\n<blockquote>don't play a game while secretly (or openly) grumbling that you wish it was something else.</blockquote>\u2026don\u2019t be ungracious about it.<br/><br/>Also:\n<blockquote>There are lots of games which have cool "indie" stuff in them but it's not strictly "visible" to the players. <i>snip</i>A simple example: play D&amp;D, but ask the players to set important goals for their characters, and tell them that it's a major source of XP in your game. When the player says, "I want to kill the Duke of Westerness!", you say, "Cool, that's worth 5000 XP. Pull it off, and you get 5,000 XPs." </blockquote>\nGood idea, but:\n<blockquote>To the players, it will feel like D&amp;D. To the GM, it feels very different: you're not writing a "plot" anymore, but prepping in reaction to the players' ideas.</blockquote>I dunno. I get what you\u2019re saying, but that strikes me as being a tad hypocritical.

Because D&amp;D doesn't really speak about any of its expectations.<br/><br/>But it can be as simple as just telling the players "hey, this works differently", and reinforcing it once or twice as it comes up in play.  With MonsterHearts, be straight up.  Say "we're not on the same team.  In fact, some of us might be playing badguys.  It's okay to get into an argument with each other.  It's okay to get into a fistfight.  It's okay to try and cut each other's heads off if that's what seems appropriate at the time."  It also helps if your game has other people who are sometimes GMs as players--people who are naturally inclined to play characters that act at cross purposes to those played by other players.<br/><br/>The reason I recommend Lady Blackbird is the "Hey, that works differently" is built right in.  When the players look to the GM and ask what happens next, the GM looks back and says "I don't know.  What does happen?"  Not every player is going to be okay with this, but they'll find out one way or another in the first five minutes of the game.  The only way they can play it wrong is if the GM lets them--Unlike MonsterHearts where its easy to play wrong and not realize until things get boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426689/#Comment_426689" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T14:47:12+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  2:47PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> Yes, Dungeon World is also an obvious choice, although I would slightly worry about being accused of bad faith by players signing up on the basis of the game being a standard \u2018kill them, take their stuff\u2019-style dungeon bash then finding that it was more like \u2018hippy weirdassery\u2019, </blockquote>\nDoes it matter?

And this could be important! Why does that sound like hypocrisy to you? <br/><br/>I find that, as a GM, I can get most of the "story game" goodness just by carefully building up thematic story material from the players' contributions. It doesn't have to be a secret, but it's not in the players' face, either - if they want the maternal comforts of pretending they're playing "the same way the always have", they have the freedom to do that.<br/><br/>I can give more examples of this, if you'd like me to. But first tell me why it sounds strange or bad to you!<br/><br/>My recommendations would be to go with games that have strong familiar RPG elements but give you traction for some more interesting "story" stuff.

Are you in?"<br/><br/>* Apocalypse World<br/>* Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>* The Shadow of Yesterday (aka Solar System)<br/><br/>Dogs' Traits could give some of your players conniptions, but otherwise it's very "trad" (a "party" enters a pre-defined situation - the Town - and works together to face its challenges).<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird could also work, but I don't find it as robust as those three.<br/><br/>The trouble with completely off-the-wall games (e.g. Fiasco) is that people can play them and enjoy them, but then discard them as "not RPGs".

D&amp;D next week?"</blockquote>\nYes, you're right, this is a major stumbling block, and is IMO a function of the fact that many if not most 'dirty hippie games' are short-form ones, which is why if it were possible to wean trad players with games like MH and AW, then so much the better.<br/><br/>In the case of Dogs, I think the trad players would be totally down with being part of a religious sect, and going to a town and attempting to convert or otherwise interact with potentially hostile NPCs, and they'd be sure to like all the dice rolling; where I suspect they'd have greater difficulty is the emotional aspect of Dogs, and with this I smell another thread coming on: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19118/what-do-trad-players-and-indie-players-dirty-hippy-or-otherwise-wantexpect-from-a-game#Item_1" rel="nofollow">what do trad players and indie players expect from a game?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426706/#Comment_426706" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T17:17:30+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  5:17PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2014 5:23PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call on White Wolf.

"Tricking" people into playing a different type of game than they signed up for is probably a recipe for disaster, and dishonest. <br/><br/>But, if you're running a game as the GM, aren't you allowed to use whatever techniques you like? That's the way it's worked in every trad gaming group I've seen. It's considered the GM's purview to adopt whatever techniques he or she wishes to adopt.<br/><br/>For instance, there are all kinds of subtle ways to change your GMing into a more player-driven mode, like the XP goals I outlined above. Here's one of my favourite ways:<br/><br/>You want the players to frame scenes, not you. You can have a huge conversation about the concept of "scene framing", and see how it goes over. (And it might go over well! But it might not, as well.)<br/><br/>Or you can do this:<br/><br/>--"Ok, Lucy, what is your character doing next?"<br/>--"Uh, I don't know."<br/>--"Well, you said earlier that you were looking for the treasure map."<br/>--"Oh, right! I need to get that map!"<br/>--"Who do you think might have it?"<br/>--"I suspect the Duke knows something. I'd like to go have a talk with him!"<br/>--"Ok, great. Where do you think you can find the Duke right now?"<br/>--"Last time he was in a tent, on a hunting expedition. Maybe he's out in the woods, still, waiting to catch the boar?"<br/>--"So, how or when will you approach him?"<br/>--"I'll try to show up when he's having dinner, after the day of hunting. He's more likely to be at the camp then."<br/>--"Ok, perfect: so, you ride up to the camp around nightfall. The soldiers are heating up pots of soup over the fires, and you can smell some fragrant spiced food from the Duke's tent. He's there, having dinner. Uh, who do you think the Duke has dinner with?"<br/>--"Uh, probably his advisors. Oh, and didn't he have a young page, as well, the one where we didn't know if he was a young boy or a girl posing as a page?"<br/>--"Perfect, so you walk into the tent. The Duke is sitting at his oak table, which probably took eleven men to lift and several horses to drag, surrounded by his advisors. The young page greets you. What do you say?"<br/><br/>I like this approach. There's nothing un-trad about it, but who's framed this scene? Effectively, it's the player. The GM hasn't really contributed anything here, except some colourful description: the player is the one who came up with the scene.<br/><br/>I love doing this in "trad" games. The game flows effortlessly, since everyone around the table is effectively contributing to scene framing.<br/><br/>I like Dave's last question, above, and look forward to your answer!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426709/#Comment_426709" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T17:26:43+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  5:26PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>where I suspect they'd have greater difficulty is the emotional aspect of Dogs</blockquote>\nThis is hard to predict!

One thing that springs to mind though is what Paul_T mentions- scene framing. IMO the most difficult hurdle for a trad player to vault is going from 'the GM narrates what happens' to 'the players can say what happens', so an intro to scene-framing probably wouldn't be a bad place to start. Or just saying to the player occasionally 'What do think should happen?' The idea that the GM has control over what happens in the game is an ingrained habit that's hard to shift folks away from, but not impossible. \n<blockquote>As for Dogs, I don't see the problem being with the players, but rather with the GM.

Yes, indeed, it looks like the GM framed the scene, but in reality it was the player.

Also, it's not that they don't want to play one particular game, in general they show a marked reluctance to engage with whole types of games. And yes JD, you're right, if they don't want to play indie games they don't want to play those games, but my problem, as I stated in the OP (but perhaps not clearly enough) is that I now want to play indie games more or less all the time, but if the club where I play every Thursday, and the home group where I play on a Wednesday, only want to play trad games, what do I do? I can't afford to go to cons multiple times a year, although I make a decent fist of attending as many of them as I can. The only other alternative locally is the London Indie RPG meetup (AKA Indiemeet) that you've probably heard me and others talking about on this forum, but that happens only once a month, and I'm generally unable to attend more than one in three of those. That's the problem. <br/><br/>Someone upthread mentioned online gaming and in fact, much as I <i>vastly </i>prefer f2f- who, really, if they're honest, doesn't?- with that in mind I asked for (and received) a mike and cans set for Xmas. I'm now going to spend the next few weeks trying to get to grips with G+Hangouts and online gaming in general, which from my pov is un unsatisfactory solution that nevertheless appears to be the only one.

I also bridle at the suggestion that I\u2019m being manipulative. My problem overall though, as I explained in my reply to JD just now, is that, apart from online (to which see previous post), there\u2019s virtually nowhere else I can play the types of games I prefer. I get the impression that most of the folks on this forum are lucky enough to have local gaming groups that are happy and willing to play indie games (otherwise, how would there end up being so much discussion about them here?) but I don\u2019t and it\u2019s driving me frantic.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426775/#Comment_426775" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T08:45:45+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  8:45AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2014 8:48AM by Paul88.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            agree Catty just trying some alternative games out for the fun of how they work or don't, would be such a relief, it does drive one frantic.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426783/#Comment_426783" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T09:58:36+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  9:58AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Catty,<br/>  Yeah, the trick is going to really come down to: if they have participated in the Internet phenomenon of Indie vs trad gaming. I have found that players who have not read/posted about this topic are very open-minded and willing to try most things.<br/>  But, if thy are aware of this false dichotomy, then they will be resistant to any attempts at subverting their perceived, preferred style. I have seen this on both sides of the fence. I have a pair of friends that I love playing with and who love playing with me and when I say D20, they literally shut down. They ask me to get back to them when I am not paying a trad game. And I know trad gamers that are the opposite as well.<br/><br/>  The best techniques to reach open minds is show, don't tell. Be the change you want to see. Run the games you like and you will find a group of players with similar interests. Once you get some regulars, you guys can take turns GM'ng/MC'ing/facilitating/etc.<br/><br/>  As to playing in other people's games, let them know if there is something that is a deal breaker and then play the game with the group. They can't give you somehting they don't know you need. But you can't expect the whole group to subvert their game to cater to your play style. It will be a compromise for sure. Many so-caled Trad GMs drift into indy territory naturally when they need to be creative or do something that is not covered by the rules. The main barrier to making this work is making sure the introduction of new rules/techniques are not abused as a way to create a "win button" for the traditional encounters. Show the GM the trust you want to receive, and you will get trust back. This will translate into being open-minded about requests for better support for your play style.<br/><br/>  I have mostly just built my own group from non-gamers/ex-gamers rather than try and integrate with existing groups, so I have not had to deal with this as much. You might want to try that instead of trying to change the group you have found.<br/><br/>  Good luck, sounds like a tough row to ho...<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426784/#Comment_426784" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T10:19:06+00:00" title="January  7, 2014 10:19AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If they are allready familiar with Changeling or other White Wolf games as a setting and you think it just was the GM who made his game in that structure it is still something you can get back to.
