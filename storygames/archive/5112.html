I was going to post this link in the December "Things to Watch" thread, but I'd really like to discuss some of the implications, especially as they relate to roleplaying and small press publishing.  I'd actually prefer that we not argue over whether Anderson is correct or not, but focus on discussing what the implications would be if he is correct.<br/><br/>Some of Anderson's main points are:\n<ul>\n<li>Mass media and appealing to the lowest common denominator will be less dominanant, thanks to a shift towards millions of very specific products appealing to minority audiences.  This is a restatement of the Long Tail thesis, basically.</li>\n<li>"Democratize technology [put it into the hands of everyone] and people will show you what it's actually capable of."</li>\n<li>"Where we [human beings] are different is where we are most passionate about who we are and what we like."</li>\n<li>"We used to think we had to pay people to get them to do things.  Now we know they will do them for free."</li>\n</ul>\nFor me, this put a lot of the discussion that happened in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4928" rel="nofollow">this monster thread on market dilution</a> into a new perspective.  Some specific question it raised for me:\n<ul>\n<li>How will things continue to change as printing and distribution costs become closer to zero?  For example, imagine that Lulu printed and shipped books for free.</li>\n<li>How can roleplaying better take advantage of the alternative sales models that Anderson puts forward if and when the core product is free (cross-subsidy, ad-supported, freemium, digital commerce, marketing, gift economy)?</li></ul>\nI'd love to discuss other aspects of his substantial talk as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115422/#Comment_115422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T15:15:35+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  3:15PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Freemium model has worked wonders for Fate and Contenders, and scores of other RPGs. I've got no beef with dropping 50 bucks on Keith's handmade Untitled RPG book as a way of saying "Thank you for this amazing, free experience." If the rules are free online, at the core anyway, the corebook stops being a necessity and starts being an Artifact of Recognition, a reverse-trophy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115539/#Comment_115539" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T09:45:36+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  9:45AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lemme recontextualize some of Anderson's main points through the lens of Fate:<br/><br/>* Marketing specifically to folks who read RPG forums and are fans of Fudge definitely worked.<br/><br/>* We respond to our fans in ways that encourage them to take our games and make them their own; we treat them as peers.  This has <i>definitely</i> lead to Fate's fans showing us what the thing's capable of -- one of them even became the "Third Hat" author, Lenny Balsera.   This is one of those things that I think Fudge as a <i>philosophy</i>, let alone a system, has always had going for it -- an attached community that's <i>very</i> (even abnormally) empowered to take ownership of what they're given.<br/><br/>* The big thing about Anderson's third point -- humans are most different where they are most passionate about who they are and what they like -- goes to the idea of creating an <i>identity</i> for fans to adopt.  Fate has its fanatics and true believers.  The "indie" label is used both to say "I am" and "I am not".  Asserting identity through your gaming choices is a <i>big deal</i> in game-marketing.  The trick is to foster this where it's positive, and to defuse it where it's negative.  I'm a fan of empowering my true believers and bringing them into the "army" and using that army for good effect (both in terms of sales and community support of the product).  But I try to cut the legs out from under any debate about the legitimacy of applying the indie label to a game or any efforts to use it as a divisive force.  Define your identity all you like, and form alliances around those common points, but don't *club* people with it.<br/><br/>* The Fudge community has been "doing it for free" for well over a decade.  This hasn't really been harnessed to great effect until much more recently, if you ask me.  There are a lot of points to make here, but I think the one I most want to make right now is: Sincere advertising is hard.  But when you make it easy for folks to share what's awesome about your game (SOTC has an SRD out in the public -- which was created *by our fans* for free) you enable them to word-of-mouth sincerely advertise your product *for you*.  Look at the bullet point just before this one: if you let someone fly their "fan flag", they will; if you give them a really cool public flag to wave around, they'll do it even more so. For other examples, consider the "Go Play" symbol-phenomenon the next time you look at all the poster-icons on RPG.net.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>How will things continue to change as printing and distribution costs become closer to zero?  For example, imagine that Lulu printed and shipped books for free.</blockquote>\nIt'll change the value of paper.  I'm not saying that books intrinsically filter out the bad stuff, but they do act as a filter: you've got to put some serious effort and/or risk into getting a book out into the world.  The cheaper this is to do (and we're already seeing the effects of this), the fatter the "paper pipe" will be.  Once you have a fatter pipe, you've got an even bigger signal-to-noise issue than before; I think we're just starting to edge onto what this means for the small publishing RPG community (and I think we've definitely seen it happen to some extent in the PDF market).  <br/><br/>The challenge of tomorrow won't be "can I get my book into print?" -- the challenge will be "how can I get noticed when as an individual publisher I am a steadily shrinking component of the overall market?"  Services will need to exist which not only consolidate (as IPR, Key20, RPGNow, etc do) but effectively filter the vast selection down to something managable for the consumer (there's a reason that I started establishing the Recommendations category on IPR; consumers need help finding the good stuff, and if you want to counterbalance a constant "What's New"-ism, it's absolutely vital).  See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060005696/iagonet" rel="nofollow">The Paradox of Choice</a> to explore some of the implications of fattening the paper/ebook-pipe.  Reviewers will become important when they can master the intersection of integrity, sincerity, and information-filtering; word of mouth, already a strong sales force for the small guy, will become even more central.  Alliance publication/promotional setups like Collective Endeavour, Evil Hat, and some of what we've seen with the "Forge satellite booths" will be important, too, and will need to consider how to form themselves around easily identified "identity flags", even if those identity flags are things like "I dig Vincent Baker's designs and taste in games".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>How can roleplaying better take advantage of the alternative sales models that Anderson puts forward if and when the core product is free (cross-subsidy, ad-supported, freemium, digital commerce, marketing, gift economy)?</blockquote>\nAs a community I think we've already got the leg up in terms of making direct connections with our fans.  The small press designers I know are still very approachable; they might have that "I am a creator of something awesome" aura about them, but they step right across the divide that that can create between them and their fans and make connections.  This is potent, powerful stuff.  It creates fans, and enough fans can become that "army" that I was talking about earlier -- the ambient, seemingly ubiquitous base that drives word of mouth sales and system adoption.   Now, I don't think these proto-armies are getting used quite as deliberately as they could be (though that has to be done carefully), but the nice thing about fans is that there are a few self-starters among them.  Look at what Carl Rigney's doing for Dogs in the Vineyard every day.   If I was going to sum up my perspective on this into directives, I'd say things like "Explicitly Validate Enthusiasm!" and "When You See Talent In A Fan, Deputize That Fan!" but I'm sure there's more that can and should be said, there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115649/#Comment_115649" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T13:42:44+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  1:42PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred speaks a wall of truth, as is his wont, so I'm just going to toss in one riff.

If nothing else, it's interesting to see that this issue is one that comes up in virtually every hobby that produces permanent goods. If you want to see the discussion get violent, then check out the crafting communities.  There is a lot of professional rage at the people who knit or sew or whatnot for fun, and only charge enough to recoup their costs, and thus drive down the expectation for prices.  Books aren't the only thing it's easier to get made these days, and there's something of a long tail of production that balances the one of distribution.<br/><br/>What it calls out to me is a weird contradiction in RPGs.  This is a hobby whose materials _don't_ build on one another, except in the most high-level of ways.  If I think Dune and Vampire are awesome, I am getting virtually no benefit from buying both - they're basically contradictory resources.  Sure, if I have reached a certain comfort level, I might be able to pull from one to the other (or just pull both into some abstract third), but in terms of using them as intended? That way lies madness.<br/><br/>Which is weird.  I mean, as much as I dig open content, it only helps so much without any kind of open framework, and you'll find that kind fo framework in most other hobbies, if only in terms of the tools they use.  As I think about it, it's been a long time since I've seen a game with conversion rules for playing with another game.  Some hindbrain part of me recalls that this is because someone (white wolf?) threw their weight around to squash such things and interoperability has gone down the crapper ever since.  When we talk about being open and free, I wonder if the hobby could use a step back from content to look at this overarching layer.<br/><br/>Dammit.
