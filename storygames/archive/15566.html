Instead of this, each PC have mixed motivation (ie "good" AND "bad") . I'm not sure it would work as well as with antagonists drives.<br/><br/>- <b>Drives should be differents but i can't see clearly where's the border between Traits and Drives</b>. For exemple, "Patriotism" should be a Drive in this context, but it's usually a Trait<br/><br/>There are some more important modifications i'd want to add in order  to give to the player more tools to build a story, a skeleton.<br/><br/><b>a) Meta-plots: <br/></b><br/><br/>pre-made meta-plot could be the equivalent to a scenario: a set of "thematic directions": non-human characters, that could be used by all the players during all the game (but it's not clear how it would be introduced) are some ideas : <br/><br/>- the where/who/when (etc...) of the scene would have to be created throught non-human characters sheets<br/>- When opening a new scene, some of these Non-human Characters would have to be re-used to give a sense of continuity<br/>- Players could have to pay a tax (or earn a gain) depending if they introduce the same / close / independant element. The more there are scene, the higher the would be the cost.<br/><br/><br/><b>b) "solids" consequences<br/></b><br/>Let's say you win the goal "Take Paris" or "Kill the Kaiser". In CAPES, you will narrate this a fact. In this case, it's easy to figure out. But sometimes it can be tricky to define where are the limits for the narrator about what he can state. There is also an another problem: a lot of event produce a lot of consequences:<br/><br/>- not easy to remember<br/>- and that could lead to others consequences.<br/><br/>When a goal/event is over, players have to create the consequences as a non-human character. The "winner" would have more control on this process, the the other players should be able to create minor consequences.<br/><br/>The consequences are "remanent" and can have effect during various pages or scene (some traits can be more remanent than others). During the game, the player could also "feed" the consequences", or let them loose strenght.<br/><br/>For exemple, "fall of Paris" is an important event, that should have consequences during at least the next pages. To ensure that, we create a "consequences non-human character". The winner give a 6 to "Chaos and disorder", a 5 to "temptation for surrender", etc...<br/><br/>During the next pages, this Non-human PC is still there, and every player can use it anytime. during the next page, all the Traits are loosing 1 point (unless someone have feeded one of them winning a related event)<br/><br/>As usual, sorry for my english &amp; welcome to your ideas...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352905/#Comment_352905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-01T10:26:52+00:00" title="January  1, 2012 10:26AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consequence characters appear similar in function to inspirations.

The idea of Consequences is not to give a narrative advantage but to help players establish a more structured story. So every players could be allowed to make consequences and use them.<br/><br/>Regarding Drives, i never tried to mix them, but if you say you did, it seems that it's not a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353118/#Comment_353118" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T09:44:57+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  9:44AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure the rules actually say that you can choose any of the Drives without regard to their lighter or darker nature.<br/><br/>Also consider that the Drives as written are pretty broad.  You don't necessarily need a "Patriotism" Drive, as "Patriotism" is easily covered by "Duty", or perhaps "Obsession" or "Pride".<br/><br/>You could also just go with undifferentiated Debt (Overdrawn at 6, only three Debt on a Conflict).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354222/#Comment_354222" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T05:14:32+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  5:14AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yes, it would work almost the same, you're right.
