                    Back in a thread I posted on rpg.net, someone observed that if the most misused words associated with a theory are the ones *in the theory's name*, there's something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The problem of course, is that Gamist/Narrativist/Simulationist are all adjectives and while meant to define only play, end up defining lots of different stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It's of course too late to do anything about this, given the terms' sheer saturation in theory-culture.  But I thought: what if there was a way to adapt the words to a context where the usage is clearer?<br/>
<br/>
So here's my random idea: Instead of *-ism, you have *-play.<br/>
<br/>
Gamism, is therefore GamePlay.  Narrativism is NarPlay (I'd prefer DramaPlay, but people know what Narrativism and Nar are.)  Simulationism is SimPlay.<br/>
<br/>
And people's creative-agenda preferences?  *-player.  GamePlayer, NarPlayer, SimPlayer (because people aren't gamists, narrativists or simulationists!)<br/>
<br/>
A games innate leaning towards one creative-agenda or another?  *-playability.  GamePlayabiliyt, NarPlayability, SimPlayability.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine most people who knew about GNS who saw these phrases without previous context would know what I was talking about (someone with no GNS experience would probably still be clueless, but that's not the point), making it better than pulling out entirely new words out of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?                </div>

                            I think that a theory where "GamePlay" means something totally different from "Playing a game" may prove not to be as crystal clear as you'd hoped.<br/><br/>But then, maybe I've just been in one too many "Yes, this is a game in which you play roles, but that obviously doesn't make it a <i>roleplaying game</i>" discussions :-)                        </div>

                            Y'know, a long time ago I was talking to this other kid about our favorite Nintendo games. He said his favorite kind were "roleplaying games," and I went "Yeah," thinking Final Fantasy and the like. He then went on to say "like Super Mario, Mega Man. . ." and when I prostested that those aren't (C)RPGs, he replied: "Sure they are. You <i>play</i> the <i>role</i> of Mario."<br/><br/>Anyway, Willow, I'm a bit unclear on what the renaming of player preferences is supposed to accomplish. If you're working from the principle that "players aren't Simulationists, Narrativists, etc," then how is it different to call someone a "NArPlayer" rather than a Narrativist? It's still labeling a given player as an adherent to one style, and thus still outside the bounds of Forgespeak. It doesn't go a mote further toward getting rid of the "Personality profiling" stigma of the terms.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

This is the most awesome thing I've heard on Storygames in at least a month.                        </div>

                            I think someone playing Mario in a video game is JUST AS MUCH playing the role as someone playing "The Fighter" in <i>some</i> dungeons and dragons games.                        </div>
