I'd played Morningstar's Venetian Tragedy the day before and was generally interested in having a better look at Archipelago II based games.<br/><br/>A group of us met today to give it a try at a cafe in midtown Manhattan.  <br/><br/>The book is short and well presented.  Thankfully, the printable material is available online.  I'd shipped the pdf off to my wife to print out a few days in advance.<br/><br/>The book suggests to try a warm-up round.  There were some new players at the table and the game itself was new to everyone.  With that in mind, we took the structure and the prompts and went around the table with a familiar movie to hack.  I picked Star Wars (IV) because it's a fairly universal point of reference.  It was a useful template to get everyone warmed up on the tools and to introduce how communal the scene material could be.  Highly recommended.<br/><br/>After a quick break, we sat down and selected characters:<br/><br/>Princess, Skuld (Liz)<br/>Knight, Harald (Steve)<br/>Earl, Einar (Ben)<br/>King, Yngvar (Laura)<br/>Seidkona, Gunna (Eric)<br/><br/>1.<br/><br/>The materials are excellently set up and represented for the characters to have something to refer to.<br/><br/>That said, the book really needs a serious grammatical editing pass if it gets a reprint.  Something two of the players mentioned in casual reading. [and fwiw, the tent card for the Seidkona has a "T" typo in the themes section that should be corrected for the dl pdf and eventually the original.]<br/><br/>2.<br/>some things that weren't clear from our play:<br/><br/>- the setting cards: we laid them out and flipped them over after the first use.  it helped us keep track of what settings had been picked.  i'm not sure this was mentioned in the RAW but it was a useful practice at the table.<br/><br/>- information sharing: the RAW says to read out loud the communal text from the character sheets of "The Kingdom is steeped\u2026".  The players asked that i reread the opening page of "The King has no male heir\u2026" and found that most useful.  <br/><br/>Also, it's not clear if you're supposed the share the character synopsis that's printed at the very end of the book.  We read it and found that giving the players at the table some scope of what everyone's problems and issues were helped them to not feel isolated in the cards and instructions they were given.<br/><br/>- Guides vs. Cards vs. Freewill.  As first timers, it was unclear about how much authority to share between the guides and cards.  The main Player has selected a location and may say they want a scene about x.  The Event Guide can add color to the setting but how far can the color travel before it becomes conflict?  And then the Theme guide is shares an uneasy space here.<br/><br/>We negotiated this between the players.  And thankfully the game is loose enough that it prompts this kind of discussion.  But because there are sort of specific rules about setting up these relationships about how to dress the scene with setting and conflict it was often a bit of a stumbling point for us.<br/><br/>3.<br/>What we liked\u2026 it seems like it's always too easy to gloss over the good the stuff because it's self evident.  The location cards and the setting they invoke and the beats on the reverse of the card were a godsend to the players.  Everyone loved how much material there was to work with and how it was very open to interpretation.  <br/><br/>The relationships all worked well, though we had to work a bit to get the werewolf to be relevant to our particular spiral.<br/><br/>Our game was probably about 3 hours long.  We made it two revolutions around the relationships.  It could easily have gone around again if we'd had time and rushed to fit things in on the second pass.  Three revolutions is probably about right.<br/><br/>4.<br/>The game.<br/><br/>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0 has a built in conflict tree the the players are trying to tease out the particulars of.  from that\u2026<br/><br/>The Princess learned from the ghost of her dead mother that the King wasn't actually her father. It's really the Earl. The roaming Knight encounters the dead queen's body in the swamp.  A ghostly visage of the Seidkona informs the Knight that she wears his teethmarks and it is he who is at fault for her demise.<br/><br/>We see the aged King sitting on his throne, consulting a portrait of his relative.  His mortality is heavy on his mind and the Knight has not been able to find out information about the disappearance of the Queen.  He asks the Princess to use her magic to find out what the Knight really knows.  And the Knight's murderous ways are unfolded before all.<br/><br/>The Knight learns from the demented Earl that the King's men are responsible for his frail sister's death.  A small lie perhaps?  But enough that the Knight rages and from that wolfish teeth snap at the air and he throws the large table aside and scampers off to find the King to sate his need for revenge.<br/><br/>In a more tender moment, the nubile and enticing Gunna, the Seidkona, seduces the Earl.  Her magic beds the Earl and she steals away into the night with his seed cupped in her hand.<br/><br/>The King seeks consultation with his ancestors.  The spirits of Yesterday and Tomorrow fill him.  But wait, The Princess\u2026 Skuld, she is not in that song.  Nowhere to be mentioned.  She is not his blood.  His rage mounts but he is set upon but a raving werewolf.  They battle but the werewolf is dispatched.<br/><br/>The Seidkona meets the Princess at her mother's new grave in the private garden.  The Princess wants nothing more than to rebel against the king, avenge her mother and remain a Princess.  The Seidkona tells her that all of that can be accomplished quite easily.  She has created a magic salve taken from the spirit of the Queen and the seed of the Earl.  From that the Princess is impregnated with her own unborn mother.<br/><br/>The kingdom is in tatters.  All the men are dead or scattered.  The Princess has become a recluse with her young\u2026 son?  The Queen has been born a boy.  And when this boy is old enough, the Seidkona comes to take the young man.  She installs him as the rightful heir to the throne and she marries him, becoming Queen.<br/><br/>5.<br/>Aftermath.<br/><br/>There's nothing like the joy of leaving a heavy and quiet table after a game of murder and incest.  <br/><br/>Everyone had a very good time.  Again, the system and presentation seem to really reward the type of play it's trying to engender.  Despite the hardwired archetypes and relationships, it seems to have plenty of replay.  <br/><br/>A side note about rules light games, i'm not sure if this hypothesis is correct: but i seem to find myself enjoying players in these games that are good GMs.  Being a good player is a fair reward around the table.  But i wonder if there's a meta level of story awareness that is more endemic of game control that isn't where loose games really have their secret sauce?  I don't know.  But it's something I found myself thinking about after this session and a quick look at Fiasco games I've played would suggest so.<br/><br/>Thanks for a really enjoyable game Matthijs and Jason!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325509/#Comment_325509" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T11:08:00+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 11:08AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Double King</cite>There's nothing like the joy of leaving a heavy and quiet table after a game of murder and incest.</blockquote>\nThank you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
