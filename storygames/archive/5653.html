Keep in mind this is my conclusion based on running these games and games like them for years.  <br/><br/>Don't play up the investigation and mystery stuff too much.  It too easily gets tedious and boring for the players.  I know it is central to the fiction of these game types, but that shit don't work in play.<br/><br/>Amp up the action.  In DG, Con X, &amp; HB/BPRD action is the jones of the material.  Hellboy isn't sifting through notebooks.  His ass is smashing Nazis and Lovecrafting horrors with whatever improvisational weapon he can find.<br/><br/>Open up the door for the improvisation.  A mainstay of the action horror genre is the protag having the right item when the chips are down, be it a grenade or the right sprig of whatever-the-fuck bane that scares the monster.<br/><br/>Keep everyone involved in the scene/situation.  I know that a mainstay of horror is the whole personal, oh no I know too much and am going crazy... That nonsense don't work in a group setting in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>If the game is going to end badly for the protags, always give the players the chance to do the "fuck you" to the big bads.  It sucks when you die without that one last little fuck you.  Think Constantine flicking off the devil in the movie as he makes his way to heaven.  That shit is always satisfying to players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128002/#Comment_128002" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T10:07:19+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 10:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with ya, Keith.

Use a system where death isn't a mechanical requirement of resolution. Because there's nothing more draining to tension than to have that FU button on hand. That is, death should only be on the line if/when the players think that it would be a cool and fitting end to their character to die right then and there. <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise make the conflicts about something else. Is that Cthulonian Nightmare (TM) about to stomp on the PC? Does death look like it's on the line? How about, instead, the creature absorbs the PC, if he loses the conflict, and then the other PCs have to figure out how to get him back out alive again somehow? Meanwhile the player gets to play out an inserted dream reality where his character has to suffer through his deepest fears put in there by the monstie's pseudopods drilling into his brain. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetter than death as a result, no? While not letting the character off the hook somehow. <br/>\n<br/>\nWushu could work I suppose. Just focus on coming up with entertaining failure outcomes, and most any system that won't conflict with this should work. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've always thought that Sorcerer would work well for DG. Very X-files, this. Like Mulder wants to find out the Truth that's out there, but his resources all come from a government organization that's corrupted by the very forces he's seeking out (or at least from covering up the truth about them). So here's the one-sheet:<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral Premise: What would you give to know the truth? <br/>\n<br/>\nDemons: the organization that sponsors the character, or for some, the mythos beings themselves. The powers the character gets are either just mundane abilites translated, or high-tech equipment and such, or even "alien" tech that they've aquired from the organization - or perhaps they can actually summon a byakhee! For mundane resources these, of course, can be shut down at any time by the demon (devices are "chipped") organization, if the Sorcerer isn't staying in line with their mandates. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorcerers: agents who have made the mind-boggling leap to understanding that reality isn't what most people think it is. And understand that they have to use the resources either of the mythos, or of the corrupted government in order to find out more and potentially save humanity. What other way is there?<br/>\n<br/>\nHumanity: integrity to one's own view of the truth. When writing up the report, do you say that you think that the apparently walking dead folks were the result of hallucinations due to spores? Or do you stand by your belief that there actually were walking corpses, and that the spores caused it!!! At humanity zero, the character succumbs to the lies and madness of the mythos, and becomes part of the conspiracy. <br/>\n<br/>\nLore: Understanding the government's buearocracy, and/or the mythos, such that one can manipulate them. Sorcery risks loss of humanity because, of course, you have to deal with the impersonal government in it's impersonal way, or, worse, you have to deal directly with the insanity and delusion of the mythos beings. <br/>\n<br/>\nSetting: The modern DG setting. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you work for the FBI as a demon, it'll have a Need for Reports, perhaps, and a Desire to Close Cases. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Big question... are you using pregens? Or will there be character generation? The answer will determine what sort of prep you need to do in terms of "scenario."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128037/#Comment_128037" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T11:09:05+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 11:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 11:09AM by Mark_Causey.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great ideas, Mike, truly.

This is the number one cause of crappy sessions, IME. The GM "knows" that the big showdown can't happen until hour 4 of the session, so fuck you players! Twiddle your thumbs between now and then because it's not happening early. Feh.<br/><br/>Instead, run the badness like a town in Dogs. There's a thing that is all wrong and fucked up, and when the team arrives, a bunch of NPCs dump weird shit in their laps and then start begging for favors, ordering the PCs around, lying to their faces, trying to kill them, etc. There's no big mystery to uncover. Or rather, there is, but the situation is setup to be <b>revealed</b> to the players (quickly!), not to be obscured.<br/><br/>At one hour into the session, the PCs should have five good ideas for what to do about the problem, and are likely arguing about the right solution while someone is building a flamethrower. They shouldn't still be wondering what the hell is even going on.<br/><br/>If the team rolls in, talks to two people, and decides to dynamite the old mine and to hell with the consequences, then yeah, they do that. Maybe some nasty monsters try to stop them, with killing. But they do it, the mine caves in (or they fail and everyone dies or whatever) and the situation is resolved. Case closed, motherfucker! NEXT.<br/><br/>Then they're off to Nepal. But maybe destroying the mine didn't really fix things, you say. Maybe not. But hold off on that. Send them to Nepal, and present them with the case of the demon-possessed cannibals who are preying on the monastery. After that, yeah, maybe HQ sits them down and gives them shit about their blowing up the mine and killing a bunch of civilians and there's STILL some squicky thing eating babies over there so go back and do it right this time!<br/><br/>Anyway, you get the idea. Don't manage how things need to turn out to have a big climax at the end of the session. Let the PCs act with authority and power, and let their actions matter, immediately. The players will probably be flabbergasted the first time this happens. Like, "We did it? That's it?" And you can be the zen master Dogs GM and just look at them blankly like, "I don't know. Are you done with the case now? HQ has more work for you."<br/><br/>Like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128389/#Comment_128389" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T06:06:57+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:06AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>What's a good formula for a Delta Green one-shot?</blockquote>\nBug Hunt and Haunted House are the Go-To formulas for DG.  Bug Hunts are all about finding out enough about the creature to get a step ahead of it and destroy it.  Haunted Houses are all about <br/><br/>Here's a easy idea: A Delta Green research facility got its hands on a collection of pre-war Ahnenerbe audio and visual recordings from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnenerbe#Karelia" rel="nofollow">Karelia</a>, including the footage of Miron-Aku.  Except it's the real deal, and it works.  On tape.  Just like in "Evil Dead" when Ash plays the recordings of the passages of the Necronomicon, when the AV tech at this facility plays this footage, it summons evil spirits of the dead, who proceed to posses everyone at the facility and turn them into demon-zombie-asshats.  But not before a call for help is made. To further complicate things, this particular facility stores enough evil mojo'd magick items and awful books to fuel the demonic equivalent of a nuke.  The demons can't get into the vaults...yet.  But it's only a matter of time.<br/><br/>Enter the PCs.<br/><br/><i>Should it start with a tangential gun-fight or be a slow build to climactic battle?</i><br/><br/>You start Action! with a Bang!, you start Horror! with a Shock!, so you have to decide what kind of scenario you want.  Personally, I think Action! sort of misses the boat with DG, and the real juice is in the horror potential, so I'd start with a Shock!  Usually that means a body, or crazy supernatural event.  Something awful for the players to react to, something that says "It is only going to get freakier from here on out!"<br/><br/>If you wanted to start with a bit of a Bang!Shock! start for the above adventure as the PCs are getting out of their car at the facility, with a security guard running across the lot towards them.  Let them assume the guard is rushing to greet them, and then spring "As he closes, you see his face is twisted in a feral snarl and his hands are twisted into claws.  Flecks of foams gather at the corners of his mouth, and his eyes are full of madness and hate as he leaps at you screaming!" on them.  POW, they shoot him dead, but now they are tense.<br/><br/><i>What do I need to mix in to optimize the fun? What kind of scenes should show up?</i><br/><br/>Horror is all about building, sustaining, and releasing tension.  False scares are great early in the adventure.  I ran a party through an adventure in an abandoned asylum, and totally got them with a raccoon running around in an air duct.   They totally thought swarms of rats or evil bugs or hideous insects from some crack in reality were going to feast on them.<br/><br/>Toss a few NPCs into the party, give them personality, make them useful, and then have them just disappear at random.  Don't explain it.  Maybe, later, if you're feeling nice, have a body show up.  All of the NPCs should be dead right as you're getting to the climax, so that the PCs start thinking "Uh oh, we're next?"<br/><br/><i>What have you done in the past to make a good game? What has happened in a bad game?</i><br/><br/>Good game: stay in genre, resist the urge to crack jokes, <i>NEVER MAKE FUN OF THE PRETEXT</i>, interrupt player levity with creepy, spooky shit.  Know when to pull back and let player's catch their breath.  <b>Less is more.</b> <i>Hint, don't show.</i>  Player's imaginations are their own worst enemy, use it against them.  Leave blanks, let them fill in what's going on and it'll freak them out more.  Be evasive, and focus on weird, mundane things like doors creaking and strange thuds or groans.<br/><br/>Bad game: having monsters standing around out in the open or sitting in rooms (too D&amp;D), referring to monsters by name (always call it "it" or "the thing" or "the creature"), and being overly descriptive takes the power to imagine the creature from the player, and again, players scare themselves more than you can..  Don't describe it, describe parts of it, never let your players "see" all of it. Letting jokes get out of hand or making fun of the genre/pretext, confusing gross with spooky, all of that spoils the tension.<br/><br/>And I really have to disagree with John above.  Delta Green is not Dogs in the Vineyard, and shouldn't be run like Dogs.  That misses the whole point of Delta Green.  It's <i>horror</i>.  It's not about escalating conflict, it's about escalating <i>tension</i>, and tension needs time to build, to stew.  Conflict relieves tension, and that's why conflict should be held off as long as possible.   If you just hand everything to the players right off the bat, then there's no tension, there's just conflicts to be resolved.   Then you end up with monsters that aren't actually scary, they're just squicky.  They're just rubber monsters that eat babies, and your players never get the opportunity to really get freaked out by the fear of the unknown.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128543/#Comment_128543" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T09:45:51+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John: You've got me seriously considering DitV as the system for this.

Not to be offensive, but what you have there *does* sound like D&amp;D-ized DG. And in all CoC play that I've ever seen, nothing destroys the horror more than the play just being about research and destroy. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr... rather.. maybe you and I are actually on the same page. Maybe I'd just rephrase it differently. That is, when you say that Haper is wrong about the escallating conflict, and say it's about rising tension, I'm seeing the same things. I'd actually agree that DitV might not be the best system for this. But one thing I think is true is that leaking bits of information isn't at all an increase in tension. That even tends to include body count. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I asked if there were going to be pre-gens. What's important to rising tension is that the stakes rise for the characters. This is what's missing in most CoC play. The characters don't really have anything at stake... perhaps a fee to do the investigation, or just "whatever will happen if we don't intervene, though we're not sure what that is, because we don't understand the problem yet!" These are weak, and formed out of the classic "toss characters into a party" structure of play. Where you have to create generic reasons for characters to be in a group and on a particular mission. In much CoC play, there's never any real good explanation given ("you get a note from a friend asking you to investigate...")<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are positives and negatives to pregens. On one downside, and it's a whopper, is that you have to pray that the players get into the character you make. And there's simply no more garuntee of this than an author has that people will like the characters in their novels. Unless you are an awesome author, don't expect that people will just take to your characters just because they're archtypal in the game. If they don't take to the PCs, then all is lost from the beginning. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe upside of pregens, fortunately, allows you a fighting chance to combat the downside. And that is that you can prepare the scenario in detail to be all about the pregen characters. Note that this is the problem with most published scenario materials that they do not know who the characters are, and (as I've said above) cannot tailor the scenario to the characters in any but the most gross of manners. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is this important? Because if you do tailor the scenario to the characters then you can accomplish two things: <br/>\n1. You can make the characters more interesting. Many characters in fiction are interesting, in fact, solely because of the situations into which they are put. See Alfred Hitchcock. Even if the players have lackluster interest in the characters because they didn't have a hand in designing them, they may grow into a character that is put into an interesting situation as they help to craft the character in his responses to this situation. <br/>\n2. You allow for that all-important increase in tension over time. Why? Because you can give the character things that they value, and slowly threaten them one by one. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is key. When the immediate threat is to life and limb, then everything has been put on the table immediately. How can you go up from there? Well, in fact you can, in that you can threaten the character's family and such, too. But I think that good horror starts with smaller threats, and works its way up. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow... does that mean that it's horrific if the character has to face the loss of his job, for instance? Well... not terribly. These early threats are not actually all about creating the horror, truth be told. They're about creating empathy (or at least sympathy) for the character. "Ah, he's one of us, with foibles and daily trials and tribulations." Because it's only once we value the character as somebody like us that we can truely feel afraid for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's key. If the characters is some super-spy that we can't possibly truely empathize with, then we're just not going to feel scared when the character is threatened. This is, again, Hitchcock's genius that he puts not superheroes in his stories, but the "common man." That's not to say that the characters can't be admirably talented. It's just that they have to be very human to us. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe irony that makes InSpectres funny, rather than horrific, is the fact that the "rising" tension of supernatural horrors never becomes greater than that of paying the phone bill. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo this way you have more material, too. You don't have to have the scenario be all shooting, all the time, and have that become boring fast. You have more to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as an example of what I'm talking about, I'm advocating that you do a full-on relationship-map design for the situation. Make characters who have real lives, and things in which they're invested. Make this mechanically true, if at all possible (I hesitate to mention using Hero Quest, because I always do, but it would do this part well, at least). Then have your action built as bangs that deal with rising threats to the character's world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have pregenerated characters this is very easy to do, to make them the center of the scenario. Yeah, sure, there's a situation going on that's to do with discovering some dark mythos secret or something. But that's just what we use as a pretense to stress the character's values and how he deals with those threats. The fact that it's DG means we get to be very creative with these threats. But not that we should make the threats themselves the center of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I'm not against starting the game with a shoot-out or something. But I think that it would be best if it's with mundanes who may have clues, and not with something worse. And then after that, drop back down into the personal lives of the characters, before rising up again to deal with the threat from beyond or whatever. Done right, this can be a good part of the overall rising tension. An easily handled fight early on contrasts against the fight with the baddy from below which is much harder. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, now you've done it... I have to go and post an entire example.

First we'll use Miles' nifty idea for the adversary side of things. And then we'll throw in a R-map and characters and see what we can come up with for bangs. <br/>\n<br/>\n(As always, ten bonus points for the first person to identify from whence I ripped off the r-map. No, it's not X-Files.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPC Characters - <br/>\nReginald Murphy - brand new CIA agent, and computer genius. A "golden child" prodigy of the FBI academy (from where he was recruited by the CIA) who is seen by his superiors as the potentially the means by which they can convince their superiors that they're going to one day get the terrorists. On the other hand, many in the intelligence distrust Reg because he's been very open about his belief in certain paranormal phenomena. Those who don't believe it (or who are, perhaps, part of the conspiracy) demonize Reg as a crackpot. Reg's beliefs stem from certain first-person confrontation with some Ahnenerbe residual cultists who he has since learned were somehow involved in his parent's deaths when he was a child. This is when Col. Miller recruited Reg and his freinds for Delta Green. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobert "Red" Georgios - Reg's good friend from the FBI academy, Red doesn't always buy into all of Reg's theories, in part because he wants to keep his nose clean in the organization. His family worked hard to get him where he is (they, too, are members of the FBI), and he doesn't want to jeopardize that. Or, worse, make his appointment to the academy look like nepotism. This said, Red and Reg have been through some odd situations together, and Red knows that Reg is probably right about more than he'd like to admit. Whereas Reg provided the technical know-how in their tandem, Red is the heart of the team. <br/>\n<br/>\nRosa Batista - Rosa is the third leg of the team that includes Reg and Red, graduating from the same class as the other two. Rosa is a crackerjack analyst, a veritable font of data on everything related to intelligence gathering. In fact her support of Reg is probably much of the reason for his success. The fact that she's quiet, and working in a male-dominated profession, has kept people from realizing that she is the real brains behind the team. Or at least from giving her any recognition of this fact. Most other agents think that her focus on facts makes her myopic to other factors in the intelligence community. There is probably some slight merit to this, but Rosa is usually smart enough to make up for her overly analytical personality, despite perceptions. Rosa and Red are very different in personality, but this has lead to a tension between the two as it's obvious they are interested in each other. Opposites attract. <br/>\n<br/>\nDiana Georgios - Robert's sister, just a year behind him at the academy. Diana has always had a crush on the "Golden Boy" Reg. For his part, Reg is interested in her, too, but his friendship with Red has made pursuing any relationship between the two of them a bit awkward. Red tends to be very protective of the person he still sees as his "little sister." Diana is anything but helpless, however, and quite a dynamic agent. In fact since her graduation last year, she has gone out of her way to prove just how bold she can be. This probably to impress Reg, who she holds on a pedestal as a paragon of righteousness. <br/>\n<br/>\nNPCs - <br/>\nTaylor Georgios - Father of Red and Diana Georgios, Taylor is a once field operative who now holds down a high-level administrative position in the bureau. He loves his children, but his paternalism tends to take the form of driving them to do what he thinks is best at times. Taylor was tangentially involved with the events that followed from the Innsmouth event, and so has some inklings of the conspiracy (and is even somewhat idealistic about finding the truth). But he also believes in protocol and keeping out of classified business that isn't on assignment. Especially if doing otherwise threatens his family in some way. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegina Georgios - wife of Red, Regina is a doting mother (sometimes to a smothering degree), who wonders if its right to have gotten her children into the same field of work as herself and her husband. She has unofficially adopted Reg, too, her son's good friend, and dotes on him just as much as the others. Her administrative position often makes it possible for her to deliver creature comforts to her children (and Reg), which they find embarrassingly nepotistic, despite it being well intentioned. Regina simply cannot stop herself from taking what action she can for her children, even if they are adults now. <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila Marsten - Shiela is another CIA operative who Works on some of the same intelligence operations as Reg. Her main asset is her physical beauty, and personal charm - but that's not to say she's unintelligent. Just that she knows what her assets are and how to use them. As such, she's often the point person on under-cover work, such as missions devised by Reg. Reg and Shiela have a physical relationship, but it's actually quite superficial, Sheila being mostly attracted to Reg's celebrity. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Croyden - Frank is another agent recently recruited by the CIA, who often works the same intelligence analysis duties as Reg. While generally not as good as Reg, he is far more politic, and his adherence to the party line makes him quite a lot more popular with the intelligence factions that demonize Reg. Frank is quite sexist, and thinks that the female agents that Reg works with are incompetent. Especially Rosa, as he's also quite racist (he'd say that Rosa got into the academy based on unfair quotas). When after all, it's more likely that Frank's popularity as an agent comes mostly from those toadying up to his father. <br/>\n<br/>\nThomas Croyden - Frank Croyden's father, and a member of the NSA. Definitely part of the conspiracy (Majestic?), Thomas does what he can to eliminate ideologues like Reg from the US intelligence community before they find the truth. Instead promoting the careers of agents like his son who unquestioningly follow orders from above. <br/>\n<br/>\nColonel William Miller - ex-army intelligence officer Bill Miller is now the head of CIA recruiting, and a high-ranking member of Delta Green. He knows more than most DG operatives, but keeps most of what he knows close to the vest. Understanding to some extent that dangers of the conspiracy that they're up against, he feels that it's best to let agents slowly assimilate to understanding the nature of the conspiracy. He's seen too many operatives either get swallowed up by the enemy, or go batty trying to deal with it. He, himself, dances on the edge of madness at times, knowing as much as he does. But an extremely strong moral core keeps him centered on what must be done. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSituation \u2013 <br/>\nSomething is going wrong at CIA station X-Ray in New York. Taylor Georgios gets a call to send in the most local agents he has to deal with whatever is going on from Thomas Croyden. Croyden knowing that the only agents on hand are Reg and his pals. This may solve all his problems if the Ahnenerbe curse manages to get them all killed off. Col Miller has gotten wind of this, however, and suspects that something is up, and has told Taylor to have the kids proceed with extreme caution. He will be arriving as soon as possible himself to lend a hand. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext up, Bangs!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128787/#Comment_128787" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T15:20:21+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  3:20PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did NOT say to run DG with the Dogs system.

Frame the first scene like so:<br/>\n<br/>\nReg was called by Taylor Georgios at 0300 hours today who asked him to check out a non-responsive security reporting station at a CIA facility known as Station X-Ray. Taylor did this knowing full well that Reg would call on Red, Rosa, Diana, and Shiela to help. Reg has done so, in fact, and the group of agents asssembled at a coffee shop in a small town in upstate New York to get a quick debreifing from Reg at 0600 hours (it took everyone a couple of hours to drive up here). Each agent arrived via his own automobile, and after the debriefing from Reg, everyone proceeded on to facility. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a bitter cold 20 degrees F outside, and the wind chill makes it feel like 5 degrees. The roads were not terrible driving, but it looks like it might snow. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe facility is about ten minutes outside of the small town. It is hidden in an old Wollastonite (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollastonite) mine that was tapped out a long time ago. The operation still maintains the pretext of being a mine, but it was refitted 10 years ago as a research facility for the CIA, purportedly to work on determining what sort of biological warfare capacity was available to terrorits organizations. The staff of the facility is supposed to be 30 individuals. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe security station at the facility is supposed to report into CIA central command every hour, and has failed to report since 1600 hours last night. This is the sort of black operations site that cannot draw attention to itself, so the decision was made not to send in a special weapons team or the like, so as not to draw any attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr so Thomas Croyden claimed when talking to Taylor Georgios. Taylor has relayed his concerns on to Reg that he thinks that the whole thing stinks, and that he and whoever he brings along should take special care with this assignment. In fact Taylor is also pretty sure that the claim that the facility does bio-weapons research is bunk, too. He's not sure exactly what does go on there, however. <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore he left, Reg printed out a layout of the place sent to him by Taylor. It shows the security station located in the offices on the lot above the actual mine. Below are supposedly various labs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBang the First - Randal - <br/>\nAs everyone gets out of their cars in the lot of the facility at 0620 hours, they note a few things. First, there are lots of cars here, enough for the full day staff. But they aren't scheduled to all be here until later today. Then they note somebody walking towards one of the cars. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis individual is one Randal Fredricks, AKA Khalid Fredricks. He is a cacuasian convert to Islam, who has been recruited by radical Islamic extremists. They give him assignments that involve watching US government installations and the like. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes Randal feel important. Randal otherwise has low self-esteem. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe came here today beause the terrorists have been monitoring the communications patterns coming out of this installation. They cannot break the encryption, so they have no idea precisely what goes on at this location. But they did note the break in commo last night, and wanted to ascertain if the facility was being shut down. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo they sent Randal in posing as a local looking for a job at the mine - simply to see if the front was still operating. Randal arrived, and, finding nobody in the offices, decided to look around. He's startlingly nervous, as the lack of people here (despite the facility obviously still being in use) is unsettling to him. Add this to the fact that he really is in no way a trained agent, and he's really on the edge. He has a concealed nine millimeter automatic in his winter coat pocket, and his hand hasn't left it since he arrived. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf questioned, he will be evasive, and simply try to get into his car to leave. He may mumble something about coming to look for a job, and that nobody is around. If pressed, especially if he's prevented from getting into his car, he'll panic and pull his gun on the the team. He'll then tell them to move a good distance away, and attempt to flee in his car. He's not in any way a trained combatant, and should not be difficult to deal with if the PCs choose to take him on (doesn't make a gun waved in your face any less stressful). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is disarmed somehow, and questioned, he will stonewall only for a short while. Then he will suddenly start spouting Islamic propaganda as a defense mechanism. That won't last long, either, and careful questioning will reveal that he is a spotter for a Terrorist organization. But it will also reveal that he's probably telling the truth about him being the only one on assignment here. It should become an open question whether or not the problem here has been caused by terrorists. And precisely what should be done with Randal as well. If given an opportunity, he will flee to his car, even if he knows that his eventual escape is unlikely with his identity unknown. He simply doesn't have any other plan. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf kept around he will whine about his rights as an American citizen, while simultaneously breaking out into occasional rants about US worldwide tyranny, and the inevitable rise of Islam. He should be as annoying as possible, both in being relatively harmless, and yet in trying to make himself as obnoxious as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n(As Miles says, don't play this for commic effect - make it sickening instead, a clear case of somebody who has been badly socialized, and is being taken advantage of by people with a distinct lack of morals). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Offices Bang - <br/>\nIf the characters investigate the offices (note: not "when," "if" - if they decide to go off on an entirely different tangent that's fine), they'll find that the front is not manned. Everything looks like it was abandoned yesterday. A TV is on in the break room. Newspaper left on desk. Coffee machine still heating evaporated contents. On reaching a back boiler room, however, they discover the corpse of a canine secuirity dog (german sheppard) laying slain with several knife wounds in it. Blood is all over. This dog detected the evil spirit in it's guard handler, and attacked him, chasing the guard into the boiler room. The guard had grabbed a knife from the break room to defend himself (his weapon got locked in the security room), and used it to kill the dog here. There is, therefore, a ton of blood in the room, not just the dog's, but the guard's as well. This should be apparent from the volume and placement (there's blood on the dog's mouth, but no wound there). <br/>\n<br/>\nFinding a corpse is not the most character-specific of bangs, but it does ask questions like how the characters handle guesome situations. And it's all part of the escallation here. They're risking small bits of sanity at this point in order to get information from the scene. That sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore coming...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129035/#Comment_129035" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T08:26:46+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  8:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 8:30AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Security Station Bang - <br/>\nThey can get access to the security station remotely by calling the right people, in theory. But, in this case, the "right people" means going through Thomas Croyden. Croyden will demand an update on what's going on, and demand assurances that he will be kept in the loop on this mission before giving out the access to the security room. Make accepting his demands as galling as possible so that it's a real choice for the PCs about whether or not to take Croyden's help. <br/>\n<br/>\nInside the station there's not much to find, actually. It was abandoned when the guards here were taken over by spirits, and failsafes locked the room, and the logs, etc. The logs and such will show that the guards simply stopped making entries at 1600 yesterday. The security camera tapes, however, do have one clue. They show the guard who killed the dog being chased down the hall with a knife heading for the boiler room. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Croyden Arrives Bang - <br/>\nFrank has gotten wind of this mission, and wonders why his father didn't give him the assignment (not understanding the danger involved), given that he is actually just as close as Reg to the site. So he has taken it on himself to find out from his contacts the basics of the mission, and has driven to the site himself intent on upstaging the others. When he arrives he will try to bully the others into either leaving, or staying only if they follow his orders. He really has no authority here, but he'll imply that his father sent him, and possibly make other lies to gain credibility. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrank has with him one "Agent Mackowski," who is a big tough silent type obviously wearing a bulletproof vest under his suit, and obviously packing. This agent will normally answer only to Frank. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo they follow Frank's lead? If not, do they investigate separately? Do they confront him?

Enough for some good misunderstandings to potentially form. <br/>\n<br/>\nSubsequent Continuing Complications Bang - <br/>\nIf Diana gets involved at all in the conversation, and it gets more awkward, ramp it way up by having Red enter the room just then, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nMom Calls Bang - <br/>\nRegina Georgios calls on her cell phone. She's heard that Reg and her kids are out on assignment, and she figured that they might be hungry. So she's already on the road half-way there, bringing lunch.

We don't really even have to know what happened to them, though it can be fun to have the PCs find the body later. A good candidate for this is "Mackowski," Croyden's crony. It's reusable, however, and later can include Sheila, and/or Regina. At some point Croyden should disappear, too. But...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding Croyden Bang - <br/>\nThe bad guys decided to tie Croyden up (unfortunately!). And the PCs find him like this. Do they rescue him? Now? Or maybe he's fine all tied up?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding a Body - <br/>\nAgain at some point finding the "red shirt" Mackowski dead is a good idea. He's a tough guy, so whatever took him out must be badass. Right? Mackowski is found hanging from a fan, too. What could have gotten him up there? Note that finding a Red Shirt dead is probably less of an escallation than finding somebody you care about tied up... Play it by ear. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinding a Hostage - <br/>\nAt some point either Shiela or Regina (heck, maybe both!) are discovered tied up, too. This time, however, as the good guys rush to save them, one of the baddies steps forward with a strange ornamental sword held up to her neck. They ask the group to disarm themselves, and will tie them up, too, if allowed to do so. Do the PCs risk the hostages with derring do? Or do they submit?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA Note on the Baddies: per Miles' description, these guys are effectively undead. They don't have the memories or knowledge of the bodies that they inhabit, but they do control the body, and can make it function past what would normally kill a person. Only badly dismembering the corpse, or special exorcism rites can stop them from making the body do their will. So while the body is still living, they do not at all appear to be "undead." They look like normal lab techs or other facility staff who just seem to have gone stark raving bonkers. Croyden will conclude that all that's going on is that some psychedelic compond was released from one of the labs or something. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Zombie Spirit Demons act, in fact, like crazed Finns, as that's what they are, essentially. Dead folks who have been brought back, and who are not quite sane from it. They're tying people up to have bodies ready for when the Boss summons more of his dead Finnish buddies...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an awesome set-up, because every demon-zombie that's harmed means that somebody's body is being damaged or destroyed. Somebody who could be restored in theory. So in every case it's like, "Do you do the expedient thing defending yourself? Or do you try to capture them all? Or?" Every fight is a bang. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote on Locale: it's quite possible that the PCs decide not to conduct their own investigation of the mine site. If this happens, then the zombies move on, and the PCs encounter these bangs down the road as the Zombies and Thomas Croyden become collaborators in silencing the PCs. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129115/#Comment_129115" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T10:19:51+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 10:19AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Big Lie Bang -<br/>\n<br/>\nIf investigating the mine portion of the facility, the PCs will discover that it's not a bio-weapons tech lab, but that there are lots of odd artifacts about involved in strange experiments. Once they understand that it's something supernatural... who do they tell? If anyone? If they don't investigate, then the zombies will have artifacts on them when they attack later. Either way the truth about the operation should become clear at some point. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tape Bang -<br/>\nEither in investigating the facility, or obtained off of some liutenant zombie, they find the tape. When viewing its contents, they get the gist of what it implies, and have to ask themselves... is this for real? The question becomes more compelling when one of the viewers is mentally attacked by the tape. If they succumb, they will become a zombie, and try to get in contact with the other zombies. Then their friends have to decide how to handle their strange behavior. The tape does hold the secret to exorcism, too, as it happens, and if watched far enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo somebody can be dezombified by being forced to watch the ritual. But the spirit inside won't sit still for it, and may threaten to harm or kill themselves if somebody tries. Remember this doesn't really hurt them all that much, but would effectively kill the character affected. They can only be restored if their body is alive when the attempt is made. The zombies would prefer to keep the bodies alive so as to be less detectable. But they may well kill their body if they need to in order to stay in the living world. <br/>\n<br/>\nSelect a character to be affected that will tweak the PCs social problems. If Reg is falling hard for one of the girls, then have her - or maybe better yet, the other - get hit with the curse. <br/>\n<br/>\nTreat the tape as a "Tome of Forbidden Knowledge"... that is viewing it is sanity shattering, potentially. Worse, a character can, if they wish, try to "understand" what's going on. If they do, they can learn both the zombification, and anti-zombification rituals and don't need the tape to do them. But at what cost? If neccessary, decide that the tape can't be used for dezombification purposes, and the only way to do it is to learn it from the tape. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Possession Bang - <br/>\nFor kicks, as I say above, if the cursed character is a PC, have them stuck in their body, but unable to do anything with it, and constantly tormented by nightmarish visions. They don't know what's real and what's not. At times they feel that they're back in control of their bodies, but they are not. During these times the most horrific stuff will happen to them. Bangs like:<br/>\n<br/>\nReg: Diana and Shiela are both about to be killed by demons, the result of him missing some intelligence analysis, and the demons being able to get to them because of it. He can only try to save one. Which does he attempt to help? How does he respond to what seems to him to be the death of the other?<br/>\n<br/>\nRed: He comes in on Reg standing over the body of his dead sister, the killing blade in Reg's hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nRosa: She walks in on Red in bed with Shiela. <br/>\n<br/>\nDiana: She has gotten scared by something, and in her hesitation Reg has been captured. As she finds him, he's being hung, but still wriggling, apparently alive. Of course to save him, she'll have to walk through the acid-bath that's knee deep below Reg...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ritual Site Bang - <br/>\nAll of the ancestor spirits that could be summoned by the tape have been (except for the one above). As such, the boss, the spirit of Miron-Aku himself, is working on creating a site where he can summon more spirits. At this point, having been summoned himself, he does not need the tape, of course. As the site is discovered, Miron is not present, but a tied-up victim is being "infected." Do they attack that individual? Do they wait to see if the ritual finishes? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Boss Bang - <br/>\nEventually there's a showdown with Miron-aku. Make sure one important PC or NPC is dead at this point. Have Miron offer to bring them back from the dead, if they'll just let him go. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129123/#Comment_129123" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T10:34:27+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 10:34AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool Mike, except Miron-Aku is a woman.

He's now officially off the case. Does he stay on anyhow, despite the potential legal consequences? Does he take revenge? How does he deal with his parents' probable disappointment? <br/>\n<br/>\nReg Finds Out that the Ahnenerbe Are Involved - <br/>\nEither with the tape, or with some documentation somewhere, Reg finds out that this is all an Ahnenerbe plot. Further he finds out a name of a suspected modern-day member of the cult. Does he run off to deal with that? Or does he push down his own feelings in order to finish up the primary investigation. Could lead to whole new plot directions. <br/>\n<br/>\nRosa Gets A Gift Bang - <br/>\nRosa has been seeing a suave Saudi intelligence operative. She's smart enough not to get suckered into giving out any secrets - and really isn't that into him anyhow, truth be told (remember she holds a torch for Reg). But during play she gets an extravagant gift, a dazzling set of huge diamond earrings. If play centers around the facility, have her remember that she forgot to open the package in her coat that she picked up in the mail on the way out the door early this morning. If at all possible, have somebody notice her opening it. Then later the operative calls her, wondering where his thank you is (tactfully), if she doesn't call him immediately. This spikes the tension between Rosa and Red, and focuses on Rosa's lack of social facility. Does she handle the gift well? Does she (or others) see it as a bribe of some sort? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiana Is Called Away - <br/>\nDiana gets a call from her superior that she needs to deal with an exciting drug bust in downtown Manhattan against some high-profile gangsters. Does she go? As it happens, it's actually a distraction sent by the conspiracy to break up the team. So even if the player decides to have her go, she'll be back as soon as is dramatically neccessary. But if she does go, how do the others feel about it? Or does she put her career at risk, give up a golden opportunity for accolades, and decide to stay on with Reg and gang? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCol Bill Bang - <br/>\nThe Colonel, not one to let his operatives fight alone, arrives just as things are getting hairy. He might even be used as a Deus Ex Machina to save the day, if need be (if all PCs are captured, for instance). But then as soon as he sees the next strange thing (tape, maybe), this is the straw that breaks the camels' back. He goes all mythos on the PCs, wide-eyed about the universe, and must be dealt with. How do you deal with your mentor if/when he tells you to come join him on the dark side? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129128/#Comment_129128" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T10:43:05+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 10:43AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And that's about enough.

I need stuff to work off of. Sans what's above, if I run a game of DG, it's going to suck... badly. I'd like to think that I'm the norm, but if you want to paint me as disabled, go ahead. I rather think that people like yourself are unusually gifted. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that, compared to the amount of prep I used to do for D&amp;D or Champions or something, this was nothing. I think of the above as relatively light prep. So as an example, I think that it's pretty appropriate. Exactly the sort of thing that I'd take to run a convention game. <br/>\n<br/>\nWeeel... I take that back. For myself I write in shorthand notes. So it might be a lot shorter. But this was for somebody else to see, so I explicated things more than I might have otherwise. So it's exactly the sort of thing that I'd write up to be a convention demo for other people to run. In fact I can show you lots of examples of such demos like this that I've written. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure Mark's will be precisely as long as he needs it to be. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, with player participation, character creation takes care of itself. So the work is about half. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody guessed where I got the r-map from?
