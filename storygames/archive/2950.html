The rules as they are now are more focused on exploring a challenge and its intricacies to come up with all sorts of different solutions, and I think that if you're going to play something more like a shooter video game, the first thing to change is to make the negotiation much quicker.  Here's my suggested conversion system.<br/><br/>First, right at the beginning of a challenge, the Challenger determines the size of adversity.  She places a number of beads on the table that represent the adversity points in this challenge (up to the Limit as usual) and declares what the threat is that the character is facing.  It could be a bunch of assault robots, a virus in the system, a section of the space station breaking down rapidly, etc.<br/><br/>The Hunter asks a few question and describes what the character is doing.<br/><br/>The Challenger's options now are:<br/>a) describe how far that works, introduce a complication, and slide one bead over to the Hunter;<br/>b) accept the solution and give the Hunter <i>half</i> of the remaining beads, with the rest going back to the Pool; or<br/>c) go to Conflict Resolution with the beads that are left.<br/><br/>Repeat a) until you choose b) or c) or run out of beads for this challenge.<br/><br/>Adversity cost is never multiplied in this system, further streamlining the move to Conflict Resolution.  Whatever beads are left when you go to CR are spent directly on the adversity.  Once the Hunter wins CR, those beads go directly into reward points.<br/><br/>Going through negotiation represents the normal running around, taking down easy enemies left and right, and making your way through the level.  Going to CR represents the "oh shit" moment when you're flanked or surrounded, encounter a bunch of harder enemies, or otherwise need to really work on surviving.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66893/#Comment_66893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T09:28:19+00:00" title="May  4, 2007  9:28AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it looks fine to me.<br/>\nRetains the very narrativist feel you have in BH<br/>\nWithout reading those conversions I dont know how many beads we are talking, how powerful the opposition is postulated to be, what the special powers or powerups (ie Tattoos) are like, whether they can like in the middle of the battle a big bright P floats through and the challenger can refresh the pool or what.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo taking that into consideration, it looks like a nice speedup of the core mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66899/#Comment_66899" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T09:50:21+00:00" title="May  4, 2007  9:50AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting, Christian. Without the multipliers, though, it seems like the Challenger has a good reason to go to CR immediately, while they still have lots of beads to build a good fight. Maybe that's okay, but that was what jumped out at me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66953/#Comment_66953" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T13:34:49+00:00" title="May  4, 2007  1:34PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, that's a good point.  Since the Challenger is supposed to honestly evaluate whether the action is good enough to overcome the current complication, at least there's some soft pressure there to hand over a bead when appropriate.  After all, the Challenger is supposed to challenge the Hunter, not defeat them at any cost.<br/><br/>If we really wanted to make this an issue, we could have all the handed-over beads flow into a separate pool (after being counted as reward points) out of which the boss at the end of the level can buy a couple of extra things.  Now that I think about it, that's not a bad solution, because it would allow the Challenger to strategize about how many beads to funnel into that pool versus trying to damage the Hunter with CR on the way.  Easy level?  Baaaadass boss.<br/><br/>Another thing: trait activations.  Here's what I'm thinking.<br/><br/>For the Hunter: One trait can, but doesn't have to, be activated whenever the Hunter describes a response to the initial threat or a complication.  If the Challenger goes to CR without the Hunter having taken a chance at activating a trait, tough luck.<br/><br/>The Challenger gets to start with an active trait if she handed over at least half the beads for complications. That gave the opposition some time to get worked up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66962/#Comment_66962" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T15:43:47+00:00" title="May  4, 2007  3:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent.
