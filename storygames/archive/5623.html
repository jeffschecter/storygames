I want to put it out here for folks to look at, steal, and comment on.<br/><br/>When a player rolls dice in a conflict situation, they have the option of posing or invoking a question about the setting. The questions are abstract yes/no questions relevant to the setting and the current storyline. Examples:\n<ul><li>Is there judgement after death?</li>\n<li>Does Venice deserve its dark fate?</li>\n<li>Is pride a virtue?</li></ul>\nEach question also has a "foil", which is a person, place, or thing in the game that is somehow involved with that question. These can include PCs and NPCs, institutions, and so on.<br/><br/>When a character invokes a question, they get a bonus die for the roll. When a character succeeds at a roll where they invoked a question, they get to write their name on the yes or no side of one of the questions in play. This must be a question that someone invoked in the current conflict.<br/><br/>At the end of an adventure, the yes and no side roll off against one another to see how the question will be answered by making a fudge roll with a bonus die for each name on that side of the question. This determines the answer to that question in the setting. The players with names on the winning side also get to narrate how that answer is shown in the fate they narrate for the foil of that question. If one player's name appears more times, they get primary control. Everyone else on that side gets concessions.<br/><br/>If the roll is a tie, the answer is ambiguous and everyone gets input.<br/><br/>That's the essence of it. I think it's probably pretty portable to other games, though it definitely wound <i>not</i> work in some games.<br/><br/>I've also posted the relevant chapter of my game in PDF form here: <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/War_of_Ideas.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://planet-thirteen.com/War_of_Ideas.pdf</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
