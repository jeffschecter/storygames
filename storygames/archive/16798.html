I'm designing a game with this now, and I'm wondering whether I'm just reinventing the wheel, and/or whether there are significant problems with this idea that I'm missing. <br/><br/>To consider an example: In my game (with a tarot resolution mechanic), characters start with five traits (and no other stats or attributes). Traits can be used for only one thing at a time in any given action. The standard uses are to add +1 to chances of success, or to draw a card when a trait forces a player to fail an action or play a card to succeed. A player may opt to use a trait for anything else that seems logical, though. Take the <i>Itchy Trigger Finger</i> trait, for instance:\n<blockquote>Carmine and his partner meet some shady dudes to hand off some stolen goods. When Carmine realizes it's a setup, he tells the GM he wants to get a shot off before anybody else, using Itchy Trigger Finger to circumvent the normal rules for initiative. The GM reminds Carmine that he'll get no other bonuses, but Carmine's cool with it. He gets to shoot first.<br/><br/>Everybody else gets a turn next, and when it comes back to Carmine's turn, he announces that he's going to take shots at two different people. Technically, anybody can do this, but the GM tells Carmine that his Itchy Trigger Finger will let him ignore the usual -1 penalty to Ability for taking a second action. Carmine happily makes a mental note to use his trait for this again later.<br/><br/>The firefight continues, and when it next comes to Carmine's turn, he announces that he just wants to shoot a guy, so Itchy Trigger Finger adds a straightforward +1 Ability. <br/><br/>Finally, Carmine's partner takes a hit in the leg, so Carmine must choose between continuing to shoot and helping his buddy to safety. He chooses the latter, taking -1 to Ability because the desire to exercise that Itchy Trigger Finger is pretty distracting. Carmine has no other traits that would help in this situation, so he needs to play a card to succeed at this action. Because the penalty from Itchy Trigger Finger made things tougher on Carmine, he gets to draw a card after the action.</blockquote>\nThe most obvious issues with this, as I see it, are potential player abuse and arguments with the GM, but I'm hoping these things can be avoided through open lines of communication. (The GM should help word traits pretty specifically before the game starts, and should generally just give the players the benefit of the doubt when they want to do something wacky, at least until after a scene has ended.) <br/><br/>Am I missing other issues? Have you encountered problems with this in similar games I don't yet know about? <br/><br/>(And apologies if I should be posting this in Praxis, but I figured it might fit here okay thanks to the open invitation to talk about other games as well.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383440/#Comment_383440" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T11:55:02+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 11:55AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, this generally works out.

But just a bit. You see, usually the players will create most of their traits taking other games traits as a base and add something they like from any fictional source. That not only ensures that everybody understands how the trait works, it also creates a sort of balance as a side effect. On top of that, players that are prone to exploit other games "bugs" will probably get a blank page syndrome trying to find a crack in rules... that aren't there to begin with.<br/><br/>So the problem of players taking advantage of the freedom to define their traits doesn't actually happen too much, except when somebody goes serious about having their own fun at the expense on the other players, trying to breake the game on purpose. My take would be to simply offer a long enough list of interesting traits (better if these are playtested ones) and add in small letters that players can come up with their own traits as long as they discuss it with the GM. <br/><br/>Heck, If any Fudge game included a really good and long enough list of aspects I wouldn't play anything else...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383481/#Comment_383481" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T16:52:46+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  4:52PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/>  FATE does this with Aspects, DITV does this with Traits, Wushu was already mentioned and HeroQuest does this as well,<br/>  I have played a ton of all of these and I don't find too many issues with scope or balance.<br/>  The one issue I have seen repeatedly is Trait grubbing. Meaning people using nad over-using Traits for bonuses. Systems like Fate mitigate this by attaching a cost to Traits. While other systems such as Wushu encourage this behavior.<br/>  So, it really is a design decision, how do you want traits to affect play. If you put a cost on them, they will be de-emphasized as grubbing is less effective, if you encourage grubbing, then the traits become an even more central mechanic.<br/>  Neither decision is wrong, but the decision will impact the players' experiences at the table.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383482/#Comment_383482" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T16:56:17+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  4:56PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird does this, too, and it works well (although it sometimes takes new players a while to shed their D&amp;D habits and embrace it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383494/#Comment_383494" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T18:00:38+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  6:00PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I'm a dope \u2013 totally missed that Aspects can work this way in FATE.

Although curiously, I've never actually seen someone take a trait that was too big ("Master of All Combat Situations Ever"): the problem is usually someone taking a trait that they think sounds interesting and fun but is in fact so tangential to what they actually do in the game and so narrowly defined that it's basically like they took nothing at all. Seriously, figuring out what's a good player-defined trait is tricky as hell, we've yet to play a game where everyone got it right in the first session. Most of the time, at least half of the group has screwed up at least one trait choice very badly.<br/><br/>As a result, we've agreed to go with "If you're not using it, go ahead and lose it" as our general rule of thumb for those situations. Basically, if you've got anything on your character sheet that you thought would be cool and relevant but turned out to be a disappointing waste of your time, just say so, and then swap it out for something that will actually make the game fun. It's totally free and there's no time limit, even in games where the rules say otherwise. Generally, the only thing you need to establish is that what you've currently got on your sheet isn't right for you (mostly by saying "I hate this"), and then clear the very, very low bar of coming up with something better.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384085/#Comment_384085" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T02:16:44+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  2:16AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First game I encountered that worked this way was <i>Over the Edge</i>, which just had its 20th birthday.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384144/#Comment_384144" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T15:33:17+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  3:33PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think they screw up balance big time. It doesn't even have to be intentional: in a Rhisus game my character had Womanizing Bachelor 4 and Military Man 2. Military Man saw much more use, and I really felt like wasting my points. And a trait like Sharpshooter would have been worse than Military Man, as there was no penalty for extremely broad traits.<br/><br/>If the game isn't challenge-oriented and losing challenges isn't punished (as in most trad games), balance isn't an issue. However, I see "closed" traits as a great way to focus the game, so I don't usually like open-ended traits much. I don't want freedom, I want pre-made choices of which the designer takes full responsibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
