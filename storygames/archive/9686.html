It quickly jumped from three guys to eight, which is unsurprisingly too many; I volunteered to run for half if John would take the other half and also step in to help me out.  I had not actually played, run or read Danger Patrol at this point.<br/><br/>Despite that handicap, the game worked out pretty well.  I ran for Kingston, Daniel and Mike.  Kingston created Vladimir Fury, the Robotic (?) Explorer with a gravity beam and z-ray vision; he was a brooding Camus fan who mourned the wild animals of the galaxy even as he hunted them down.  Daniel was The Shadow of Malakan, a Mystic Daredevil and ladies' man; he was often surrounded by black-and-purple mists and had dark connections to the Stygian Adepts of Pluto in his past.  Mike was Hostile Takeover, a Psychic Detective who was so classy he had to wear a three-piece suit over his Danger Patrol costume.  He was a reformed supervillain and provided much of the inspiration for the story with his arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarto.<br/><br/>We found out all of the above character stuff through a "previously on Danger Patrol" segment, where each character got a quick establishing one-shot.  After that, to get a handle on how the game ran, we watched John run through the opening of Episode 11:  Attack of the Crimson Apes! with Johnzo, Jackson and Joe.  He described the Patrol flying through rocketcar traffic in downtown Rocket City when suddenly the aforementioned apes started leaping onto them and going berserk, causing mayhem with the traffic control system.  The players' tokens were placed on their rocketcar in the middle, and then each threat (Ape 1, Ape 2, Falling Car, Traffic Overload!, etc) was written out on a card and placed elsewhere.<br/><br/>The players took turns in whatever order they liked, tossing in their "action chip" to mark when they'd gone; sometimes they'd move from one location to another to engage a threat, other times they'd tackle a threat directly.  The way they approached the action determined which stat would be used to roll for it--acrobatic stunts used your Daredevil die, gunplay used the Commando die, and so on.  Each die might be anywhere from a d4 to a d10, depending on how you'd chosen stats at the beginning of the game, or a d12 if it matched your chosen role.<br/><br/>Then, depending on how risky the described action was, the player could pick up one to three six-sided Danger Dice.  They could ask for even more dice from the GM or players, who would give them 1 or 2 more and describe something even more dangerous happening simultaneously.  Since the only way to overcome threats was to use successes or "hits" (4+ on the dice), and each failure (1-3) increased the character's peril, adding said Danger Dice basically accelerated the game while also making it (appropriately) less safe.<br/><br/>So, having a cheat sheet from John and a vague idea of how that system worked, we returned to our own table and ran our own version of the opening of Attack of the Crimson Apes!  I changed things up slightly so that the big threat was a bomb attached to the Rocket City dam.  While the Shadow of Malakan teleported through the mists to deal with that, Vladimir Fury used his instinct for simian communication to talk one of the Crimson Apes out of his rampage.  (Meanwhile, Hostile Takeover rocketed the car over toward the dam and got accidentally hit in the face by a hovering stop-sign carrier.)<br/><br/>Have I mentioned that threats don't actually get a turn in Danger Patrol?  Everything the GM does is a reaction, and expends the Danger accumulated by a PC's roll.  One of the ways the GM spends Danger is on "threat moves," things which change the description of a threat to something even worse without actually giving it more hit points.  It's the cheapest thing to buy, and the guys spent the whole game rolling absurdly well, so I did a lot of these!  One of them included giving a Crimson Ape control of a moving wrecking ball; another was to make the small bomb on top of the dam just a detonator to the much larger bomb sunk in the water behind it.  Vladimir Fury had to shoot the wrecking-ball ape with his laser blunderbuss, causing the talked-down ape to leap off the back of the rocketcar in despair.  (The brooding hunter shed a single tear at his suicide.)  The Shadow of Malakan ripped off the smaller bomb, but was to late to prevent its activating the large bomb's detonation sequence, so he put a knife in his teeth and dove into the water.  His initial Danger Dice came from slashing at electrical wires connected to a bomb underwater.  Kingston (I think) added more to indicate that the reservoir was full of carnivorous squid.  And I contributed the final two to add that since this was a Martian reservoir, it was of course boiling hot.<br/><br/>The Patrol defeated the threats pretty handily, and spent their next "refreshment" scene following up on the clues they'd found.  The biotechnological beetles controlling the apes turned out to have arrived on Mars by way of Pluto, so they headed off to the Plutonian section of the rocketport to investigate.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215178/#Comment_215178" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T18:12:04+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  6:12PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was the first scene for which I came up with all the threats and their (secret) ratings myself, and once again the PCs blew through it--they accumulated a lot of danger, but rarely more than 2 or 3 per roll, which meant I could only inflict minor hits and fictional threat escalations.  They also accumulated an insane amount of extra actions and power tokens (which you get as your danger increases along the track).  I think I was a little too passive on my narration; when the characters did get hit, I'd usually have it as a direct result of something they did, rather than a more active counterattack by the Plutonians.<br/><br/>They waltzed through Martian security at the port, but were blocked by the Plutonians in their sinister robes, who wanted no part of the Danger Patrol on their territory.  The Shadow teleported right past their security gate, of course, and the guards scrambled around trying to set off alarms--although Vladimir and Takeover quickly subdued them and blasted the klaxon control panel.<br/><br/>John had said at the beginning of the game that a lot of the burden would be resting on the GM, but starting here, I found that not to be the case at all--the players were coming up with new ideas for how the threats manifested much faster than I was, and I just went with it.  Most Plutonian technology, it transpired, was sort of biodemonic in nature, including a sleek red-eyed rocket (with the evidence they needed on board) and a control center computer with one vast eye and a control port ringed with teeth.  While the Shadow poofed onto the skin of the rocket and waltzed in like he owned the place (flashback--turns out he's an exiled Plutonian prince!), Vladimir and Takeover rushed in to lock down its escape launch sequence on the computer.  This involved Vladimir smoking a bowl of some sinister future opiate to achieve the proper mental state and sticking his whole hand into that fanged orifice to take control of it.  It fought back, of course, and Hostile Takeover had to psychically interface with it to help out.  This led to one of the great lines of the session, from Kingston:  "You're mind-melding with a hostile demon computer, and you're not even high!"'<br/><br/>The Patrol eventually got out with a whole cage full of biotech beetles (labelled "For Ape Use Only") and used some trace evidence to track down their next target.  This was a pretty neat interlude scene, even though I think none of the players chose to refresh, since they wanted to keep their danger high and accumulate more actions and power tokens.  The Shadow of Malakan went out with his mysterious lady friend/attempted stabber, Sibyl, and we intercut scenes of their veiled verbal sparring with the other two brushing dust from Olympus Mons off a beetle's leg.  The (ludicrous) Plutonian plan, it turned out, was instrumented by the nefarious Professor Moriarto.  He intended to blow up Rocket City's geothermal power plant, making a sham of Martian security and forcing them to hire Mafia-like Plutonian security forces instead!  They headed for the plant at top speed.<br/><br/>I tried to ramp up the difficulty a bit more here, but I still didn't have a great handle on how and where threat hits should be applied, so they blew through it almost as fast as the initial scene.  They'd also saved up a spectacular amount of extra actions and power tokens, and continued to roll a lot of high numbers, so I barely got to knock even one number off the "Geothermal Pressure!" countdown threat before they had it vented.  (We were running out of time for the last slot of the con anyway, so it worked out okay.)<br/><br/>Plutonian shark/squid/jetfighters were tailing the Danger Car as soon as they approached the plant, of course, but Vladimir and the Shadow leapt onto them and sent them hurtling into a mesa and a steam vent in short order.  I did get my one Disaster (five danger in one roll) of the game in this scene--I had the mesa explode, freeing a lava fountain that, naturally, swept downhill.  Toward a bus full of schoolkids.  Wearing Danger Patrol t-shirts.<br/><br/>While Vladimir desperately stood between the lava and the bus and used his mighty Gravity Beam to force it back, Hostile Takeover jammed some leftover Plutonian explosive from the dam bomb into a stuck pressure valve and sprinted away, dodging laser fire from beetle-hypnotized guards.  The bomb relieved the pressure (I think the Shadow vented the rest), the Patrol signed autographs from the awed children, and they made some terrible pun and laughed as the screen faded to black.<br/><br/>Next time on Danger Patrol:  Sibyl draws her knife on the Shadow, hissing "I've been waiting a long time for this, Prince Malakos!"  Hostile Takeover confronts Moriartos (I think)!  And Vladimir Fury battles Martian squid at the bottom of the sea--where he discovers his lost copy of <i>L'Etranger!</i><br/><br/>Thanks a lot to John for putting up with our many questions, and to Kingston, Daniel and Mike for coming up with so much great stuff and making the best of my hastily improvised and contradictory mechanical implementations.  I can't wait to actually read Danger Patrol someday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC" title="KingstonC"><img alt="KingstonC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC">KingstonC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215217/#Comment_215217" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T21:24:48+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  9:24PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 9:25PM by KingstonC.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game was genius.

But then again, I thought it was finished two years ago -- and the new version is clearly better -- so maybe John knows what he is doing after all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan</cite>The Shadow of Malakan ripped off the smaller bomb, but was to late to prevent its activating the large bomb's detonation sequence, so he put a knife in his teeth and dove into the water.</blockquote>\nJust to clarify, it was actually Vladimir Fury, Atomic Explorer who dove into the water and ultimately saved the day. The Shadow of Malakar, despite being a Mystic Daredevil, had failed to accumulate more than a single point of Danger, while his companions had extra action tokens to burn. I guess that's the problem with being an escaped Plutonian prince-assassin, trained in the netherdemonic arts and attuned to the Black Mists of Malakar: swinging from Ape-infested rocket cars with your magna-grapple barely even registers on the Dangerometer.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan</cite>Next time on Danger Patrol:  Sibyl draws her <del>knife</del> pistol on the Shadow, hissing "I've been waiting a long time for this, Prince Malakos!"</blockquote>\nOh Sibyl, you heartbreaker -- didn't anyone explain to you that in the Plutonian Courts, "treachery" is just another word for "love"?<br/><br/>I do think that the "Last Time On Danger Patrol" remains my single favourite bit about this game -- especially how there never actually has to have been a "last time." I do kind of miss the 'cliffhanger/peril' element from the previous version of the game (the Last Time... narration had to involve your character in some sort of mortal peril, which you then resolved as the new episode began.) <br/><br/>Actually the "Cargo cult" thread title reminded me how, after I got back from the first GPNW, I very seriously considered reverse engineering a playable ruleset of the game from my character sheet(s) and memories of the game. It really is impressive how extremely, transparently straightforward the basic mechanics of the game are -- and the new version feels even simpler than the previous fudge-based game. If it wasn't for all the different Powers I am confident I could run a kick-ass session of Danger Patrol tomorrow. And I've only played it once!<br/><br/>None of this takes away from Brendan's display of GMitudinal bravery, mind you -- it was a shame that he was rewarded by our crushing victory over any and all obstacles. I do kind of wonder about the intended "balance" of the game; we certainly rolled above average, but even so it wasn't clear what real opposition would have looked like. It's interesting that my first impression was that your Danger meter never went down -- I was a bit disappointed to hear that we got to just have all these refresh scenes whenever (though the scenes themselves were much fun.) In fact my character never even needed to reduce his Danger (I did so anyways to gratuitously grab an extra free action, going from 3 danger to 0 and then back up) -- though Kingston &amp; Michael were certainly racking it up at a fairly impressive clip.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216006/#Comment_216006" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T10:41:20+00:00" title="July  2, 2009 10:41AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Daniel: Here's the no-powers version of Danger Patrol, just in case you do want to run it tomorrow.<br/><br/>When you spend a power token, say how you're using one of your Style's special abilities (which you make up right now). Then, do one of these:<br/>- Do 3 hits to a threat<br/>- Do something supernatural (teleport, flying robot head, mind-reading, etc.) and take a bonus d10 to an associated action<br/>- Negate a hit and take a bonus d10 to your next move<br/>- Negate a hit and do a hit to your attacker<br/><br/>That should get you going. You lose the unique flavor of the Styles, but hey... at least you can play right now. :-)<br/><br/>Question: Maybe this got lost in my quick setup explanation (or maybe you guys really did roll that well): You were taking danger from each die that rolled 1-3, not just from danger dice, right?<br/><br/>Also, you're right about the cliffhanger/peril thing for Previously On. You can narrate your character in peril as part of your set-up shot, and take 1-3 danger before the game starts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216086/#Comment_216086" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T15:52:54+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  3:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Question: Maybe this got lost in my quick setup explanation (or maybe you guys really did roll that well): You were taking danger from each die that rolled 1-3, not just from danger dice, right?</blockquote>\nCorrect. We really were rolling well overall, and in my case it was a combination of that (I rolled all successes at some point, and all but one several times) and the fact that I did a lot of 'movement/bonus to other people' rolls, which naturally don't require you to stack up on Danger in order to succeed. (Not that this always stopped me.)<br/><br/>I think we forgot to take the extra Danger from a dangerous Previously On -- or at least I did. Is there advice for GMs about how often to have refreshment scenes? It seems like, ideally, most games should involve at least one PC approaching 'vaporized' territory by the final battle -- especially because of how advancement works. (It's understandable that this didn't happen in a con game, of course.) The ability to 'help' effectively with low-danger rolls lets players manage their own Danger progression fairly well overall, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216234/#Comment_216234" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T11:14:50+00:00" title="July  3, 2009 11:14AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2009 11:16AM by John_Harper.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did you guys do helping rolls?

We actually vaporized someone in our game on Sunday, but that's because the players at our table pretty much rolled all the danger you guys weren't rolling.

This seemed in keeping with the fact that the 'helper' powers mostly gave <i>everyone</i> else a Bonus Die (and by the way it wasn't clear whether you had to roll to activate those; for example, the Daredevil's 'everyone shoot at me' power.)<br/><br/>Since you only need one hit and there is a ceiling of Bonus Dice you can get (one), you don't generally need to take Danger Dice gratuitously -- especially if you can pull in a + from your Style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
