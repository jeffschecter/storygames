They do some neat things to keep the skill lists manageable, and the combat tweaks support something more like a real firefight, with suppressive fire and use of cover and stuff. The downside is that real firefights often take a long time, and that can happen here, too. The skills are a good way of doing skills in BRP, though.<br/><br/>That said, if you don't like BRP, you will probably say something like "1982 called and it wants its system back."<br/><br/>There IS something kind of like pillars of sanity from Trail of Cthulhu, so if you like that idea but don't like Gumshoe (and do like BRP), this might be your thing.<br/><br/>(Personally, I didn't have a bad time playing it, but I wouldn't want to run it. I also don't really like skills in normal CoC, though. I mean, you can just roll under your stat for stuff your character would know how to do right? Let's get to the insanity and murder by cultists, that's what everybody showed up for.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439504/#Comment_439504" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-16T19:24:52+00:00" title="October 16, 2014  7:24PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the first thing in the readme file: "This manuscript is confidential and under copyright.

I got curious about the presence of the files in a public Dropbox folder, but apparently <a href="http://www.delta-green.com/2014/10/beta-playtesting-opens-for-delta-green-the-roleplaying-game/" rel="nofollow">this is an "open playtest"</a> despite the verbiage in the readme file, and they're expecting the material to be distributed like this.<br/><br/>At quick perusal it is indeed BRP with minor tweaking of the sort I assume everybody does after playing it for more than one session. No solution to my personal difficulties with CoC or Delta Green, but I'm sure that it's a fit answer for the core audience of people who're actually on-board with prior editions. It would have been a strange choice indeed to throw those preferences away after the long and gloried history CoC has in supporting and maintaining that hardcore audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gnomadology" title="Gnomadology"><img alt="Gnomadology" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gnomadology">Gnomadology</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439505/#Comment_439505" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-16T19:38:08+00:00" title="October 16, 2014  7:38PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My impressions so far (qua rules) are disappointing.

I, for example, am intensely interested in the fluff of Delta Green, but it's basically a pipe dream to think that I'd be able to playtest this; if I haven't succeeded with BRP+horror through the last 20 years, it's not likely to start happening now. The right type of playtester for this kind of thing is the sort of person who can appreciate the minor fine-tuning because they actually use and understand BRP.

I seem to remember a discussion about what to roll when throwing a grenade, and I think the GM went with DEX times 5. So I don't remember there being a "throw skill," per se. Although if you wanted to pitch a rock at somebody you could say you played baseball in college and use your Athletics skill. That sort of thing.<br/><br/>Like there's one Firearms skill. I think my character's specialty was that he served with the marines after high school, so of course he knew how to use the assault rifle he had when we got ambushed and had a firefight.<br/><br/>It's a good idea. But like I said above, distributing skill points in chargen isn't really appropriate in the kind of CoC games I like. Of course, Delta Green is more about highly-skilled people doing their jobs and doing them well until finally faced with cosmic horror, so I assume they are going for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NathanHill" title="NathanHill"><img alt="NathanHill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/917/nAZLTLHXP58YO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NathanHill">NathanHill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439643/#Comment_439643" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-23T15:16:27+00:00" title="October 23, 2014  3:16PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the link.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the Delta Green source material and some of the basic chances they did to make it more natural for heroes to gather together for a mission/quest/etc. Really fun stuff. Glad they are looking to update it.<br/><br/>BRP has worked for me, but I tend to not read the full rules and keep things pretty darn simple with a few percentile rolls here and there mostly to escape danger. In truth, I've barely even used the most lauded mechanic, Sanity, from CoC, largely because my players have seemed so overwhelmed by it.
