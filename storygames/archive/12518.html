If you happen to live in Brisbane and haven't heard about it, you should look <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://stockade.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you were there, you should post in this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuick summary: There were five games played and a bunch more on offer. The games actually run were Siege, A Penny For My Thoughts, The Beast of Limfjord, Devil Die, and Happy Birthday Robot. Games on offer but without enough players to be run were Amber, Archipelago II, and Don't Rest Your Head, with copies of Bliss Stage, Inspectres, and Shock: floating around the place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly, we seem to mostly do playtests, but I suppose that reflects the large number of people designing stuff and most of it's pretty far along, so it's all good. Every game seemed to go well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf-arsed recap over (feel free to use the thread for reminiscing and feedback on them though). Let us speak of the Future.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. GenCon Oz was cancelled yesterday. AndyIndieCon* is in the works to take its timeslot - what new and exciting things shall we be doing for that? Or shall we just go for another Go Play?<br/>\n<br/>\n* May not be final name.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Once every six months seems like a fairly long time between gaming, seeing that I got the strong impression that most of us don't have a regular indie games group. We should really trade some contact information or something and organise games.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get us started - my email is aikynaro at the gmail dot com. I was the person offering Archipelago.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Also: Gavin (I think your name was ... the guy playing Hatchet) - I was wracking my brains on the train home trying to work out how I know you from elsewhere, because I'm sure I do. You're a NaNoer, right?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281231/#Comment_281231" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T02:40:58+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  2:40AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good to see the cane-toads getting organised, even with this year's demise of Gencon Oz.<br><br>Now if only I could get a few more cockroaches motivated down here in Sydney.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281441/#Comment_281441" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T10:06:48+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 10:06AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see the story that the Robot players created, if someone has it around to scan or take a picture of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281482/#Comment_281482" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T13:38:25+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  1:38PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There were other awesome games on offer and I almost felt a little guilty for taking people away from them with my game, Devil Die.
