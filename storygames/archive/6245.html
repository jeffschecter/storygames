And, as I often do when I find some sort of tool like this, my thought was automatically, "that would have some advantages as a tool for use with Universalis."<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like you're discovering those advantages. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe've long used Wikis as a tool for Uni recording, and it works alright, especially if you tool it up well. Sharepoint looks like it would have some automatic advantages over the Wikis we've used. But I'm not sure about how tailorable it is. Can you comment on that? <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at what's there, it looks like you guys have a ton of gimmicks ready. That's really interesting.

If you're a non developer looking for some basic features, this is pretty easy.<br/><br/>Deep customization is possible, but I've always found it a bit painful. For reference, I'm a mid-level developer. It's not my job, but I do a project or two every year just to keep my skills up. <br/><br/>I don't have any Wiki customization experience, and I'd love to hear from some who does. <a href="http://blognomic.com/" rel="nofollow">Blognomic</a> uses a custom wiki to support their online gnomic game. It's got some similarities to Universalis. They use a wiki to track their ever-changing ruleset and to store an ever-changing array of facts and resources related to playing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140030/#Comment_140030" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T11:19:37+00:00" title="April 16, 2008 11:19AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The expert for Wiki customization for us was Travis Martin. He had it so that pages marked as being components would do the math on the current importance of the component and such, and linked who had spent what. So that, in the end, your coin total was tracked automatically. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt actually turned out to be somewhat difficult to use correctly, but not at all due to Travis' heroic efforts (more due to me trying to get the perfect set-up). It was extremely cool... in theory...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm wondering if Sharepoint can accomplish the same goals, but better.
