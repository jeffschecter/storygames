If you know anyone who will be posting blog posts, announcing news on websites or twitter that would be great!  While Gencon isn't quite the place it once was for game announcements, it's great to read peoples reflections about games they've tried, seminars they attend and pictures they take of all the goings ons at Gencon.  Thanks everyone!  I'll try and keep this thread updated with anything good I find as well.  <br/><br/>Here's a some links to some places for news that I've found so far:<br/><br/><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/153611/gen-con-2013-preview" rel="nofollow">Boardgamegeek</a> has a list of all the new boardgames releasing at Gencon this year.<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/TJIGenCon" rel="nofollow">This Just in from GenCon</a> has some great interviews with people, designers and publishers at Gencon each year.  They've already started posting interviews. <br/><br/>Thanks everyone! <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jcfiala" title="jcfiala"><img alt="jcfiala" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jcfiala">jcfiala</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420169/#Comment_420169" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T20:47:01+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  8:47PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't find the webpage for 'This Just in', and they haven't posted since July.  I suspect they're defunct this year, which is a shame.<br/><br/>The RPG Site has a good thread each here where Zach (and other contributors) share news, stories, and photographs from the convention.
