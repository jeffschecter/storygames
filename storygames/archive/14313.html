Miss!"<br/>GM: *consulting his prep, there's a trap... mmmm announce future bad stuff* "As you move into the chamber to get a better look, you feel the ground shift beneath your feet, and a quick clicking sound start to emanate from the walls! What do you do?"<br/><br/>But, you're saying it's ok for the GM to plant traps that weren't in the prep on a missed roll.<br/><br/>Thief: "I want to look for traps." *rolling trap expert* "Crap! Miss!"<br/>GM: *consulting his prep, there's no trap... mmmm separate them* "As you move into the chamber, the floor opens up and you momentarily become weightless before your stomach lurches up into your throat. You hit the chute hard as you fall and slide, slide, slide! It happens so fast there's no time to react."<br/><br/>Hmmm. Not sure how I feel about that. There's a part of me that wants to say, "if it's not in the prep I shouldn't add stuff, but use stuff already there for badness".<br/><br/>Taking this to a new thread, so Jason's awesome can keep going.<br/><br/>Your prep establishes things, yes. However, when its time to make a move, you have to make a move, and that move always represents something in the fiction, which can establish new facts (so long as they don't contradict old ones).<br/><br/>That isn't to say it's entirely separate from your fronts. In my example, I figure the sewers or the goblins are probably already a front, so of course they have traps. This isn't all that different from them failing a roll and you thinking "oh, there's probably a sewer monster about, how about if it finds them?"<br/><br/>That isn't to say don't prep! Prep, in the form of fronts, is key. But you can also improvise. Your prep is your fallback, not something you're bound to. Until the players know about it, it's still up for grabs.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325077/#Comment_325077" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T07:58:49+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  7:58AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one more thought: if you have something prepped, that fits, use it!

Jason's example of switching <i>which</i> person was going to be there with the leech and horseflies makes sense to me. There was an event happening in the dungeon, he just switched up the minor details to make it more compelling. <br/><br/>Maybe it's just my old habits. But, prepping wandering monsters for missed rolls just seems to make more "sense" to me, than what we could term "wandering traps" I guess. <br/><br/>So, during my prep I might make a list of monsters that inhabit an area... "Oh, there's some trolls that live in this area and some goblins who fear the trolls who live down here..." And, when a PC misses a roll, I can look to that prep and be like, "Well, maybe this goblin squad went too far over here and that's the random encounter..." or whatever. <br/><br/>Traps feel stationary to me. They are in specific places for specific purposes. But, I suppose you could be like, "These are the sort of traps in this dungeon (goblin traps, pits, spear gauntlets, etc...), and a missed roll means there might be one of these things lurking."<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I guess another part of me that harkens back to the "old school" mentality is the existence of this environment that's been constructed and we're here to overcome the environment as it stood and not as it's popping into existence because of snowballing of moves. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that approach is wrong! So, please don't misinterpret me. I can see how random traps popping into existence is totally exhilarating and makes the game more intense. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> And, maybe I should try it out and see how it plays out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325084/#Comment_325084" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T08:32:41+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  8:32AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kind of imagined all DW/AW pregame prep as writing down little thematically linked ideas that you could later pull into the narrative on the fly.

If you want only stationary traps, I don't think that really misses anything or messes with your principles. You've got the gist of it, improvisation and all that, so if your traps stay in one place no big deal.<br/><br/>One thing I have been thinking on a lot recently is that the Trap Sense questions can actually be prompts to bring traps into play. It's like a reminder to the GM - someone's always asking you about traps, so you should probably say yes at some point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325100/#Comment_325100" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T10:09:52+00:00" title="May 18, 2011 10:09AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2011 10:31AM by John_Harper.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My prep is: "The cave goblins set crude traps to catch the unwary."<br/><br/>My move is: "You see a desiccated body here, half-buried under stones that seem to have fallen from a plastered-over hole in the ceiling." (announce future badness)<br/><br/>My hard move is: "You lunge at the goblin, and it seems to suddenly vanish in the gloom. But then you're falling and crashing against stone in the dark and you realize the creature must have lured you forward into a hidden pit."<br/><br/>So, the traps are prep. But they're not like, "pit trap at location 3C" prep. If I'm feeling clever, I might make a custom move, "When you run afoul of a goblin trap," or something.<br/><br/>I think it's really important to always look at the fiction (as if you're standing there, looking around) to determine the content of your moves as GM. You don't have to <i>make up</i> a pit trap when a PC misses a roll. What you do, instead, is situate the PCs in a dangerous situation (as informed by your prep), and paint the picture as evocatively as you can. Then, when it's time for you to make a hard move, it's easy: you just <i>follow through</i> on the dangers as established. Some of those dangers might not be fully known to the PCs yet, but they're still there, in your fictional world, and you (the GM) can see them clearly when you look around. Nothing has to be improvised right then, after the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>Uh, maybe that's what Marshall said. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325104/#Comment_325104" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T10:53:08+00:00" title="May 18, 2011 10:53AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I kinda think about it, riffing off the way Harm works, as "inflict MC moves (as established)."  You use prep and barfing forth (or the DW equivalent) to establish the context of the surroundings and the potential dangers that might be there.  Then, we you have to make a move, you make one based on the situation that you've set up, not just some random one that doesn't fit what's going on or the part of the dungeon you're in.  If you're in a room that doesn't seem like it would have traps, then don't make a trap-related move; pick something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325105/#Comment_325105" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T10:55:55+00:00" title="May 18, 2011 10:55AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I dig it.

I'm always been of the understanding that old school gaming was largely a test of player savvy and using your wit to allow your character to survive. Does some of that go out of the window when we're just coming up with stuff on the fly? It feels like cheating in a way. <br/><br/>And, another thought: does this playstyle encourage players to make moves. "I know a trap won't come into play unless I fail a roll... so, let's not roll. I don't use my Trap Expert..." It seems disingenuous for a DM to make a move then doesn't it? Like: "Well, since you're not searching for traps, well, that's a golden opportunity to PUT a trap!" <br/><br/>Something about that doesn't sit right with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325109/#Comment_325109" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T11:26:25+00:00" title="May 18, 2011 11:26AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2011 11:28AM by sage.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael, remember that moves don't just come into play on failures. Like John's non-hard move above, you can make that any time everyone looks to you to find out what happens. Since the trap's pretty crude, that's not much of a threat once announced, but consider: "You see a desiccated body here, stiff, with it's hands frozen clawing at it's throat." Sounds like a gas trap to me...<br/><br/>Not searching for traps is a golden opportunity, yeah. But you could also hit them with something else. Not searching for traps doesn't mean there are traps, it means you have some freedom to make traps, as appropriate, carry weight. Instead of John's non-hard example, you hit them with John's hard example.<br/><br/>John's reminding us of the principle "begin and end with the fiction." A trap is never just a move, it's a fictional thing.<br/><br/>As far as prep and locations, John's prep ("The cave goblins set crude traps to catch the unwary.") is what I would expect before my example ("oh yeah, there's probably some sewer goblin traps around, maybe that can be my move"). I'm certainly not suggesting that traps get placed whenever you feel like making them up. But if the players are in a trap-infested area, they haven't checked for traps, and it's your time to make a move... I'd think about using a trap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325110/#Comment_325110" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T11:30:05+00:00" title="May 18, 2011 11:30AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael,<br/><br/>If the left fork has an awesome scenario, and the right fork bypasses it completely, would you feel bad changing the location of the awesome scenario for the fun of the group? I'm not speaking to why you'd have that choice in the first place, but I think that this is what it all speaks to.<br/><br/>In my mind, just because you've written it down, drawn the map, created a diorama of it with affixed miniatures but placed it where the group isn't going doesn't affix the room to the spot on the map.<br/><br/>I used to have (what I consider to be) the problem you're having. "But! It wasn't there five minutes ago. This isn't a fixed world, but a chaotic cloud surrounding the characters and entertaining the players!" For me, it was realizing that the fiction establishes the existence of things, but the fun only comes in the full exploration of things. The only time I'd leave something cool behind was if the players via their characters made a conscious choice to leave altogether, and even then if they left in a manner consistent to pre-established fiction.<br/><br/>Then, I'd reskin it and use it later if I liked it a lot. I don't know about you, but my creativity is a valuable thing to me.<br/><br/>I haven't read the entire thread.

At least on the margins of the fiction.  That it was definitely more "cool ass adventure" than "overcome the pre-set dungeon."  We actually joked to the Thief about his looking for traps brining them into existence.  I see that as more of a feature than a bug.  Someone picks the Thief because they think traps are interesting challenges.  If their rolls cause more traps to show up, or cause the GM to put some traps in as hard moves so the Thief can spend their hold, that seems like the desired outcome.  Player votes for traps being cool causes more traps.<br/><br/>I'd say Trap expert is less like a classic search for traps, and more like taking out trap insurance.  Because it's hold, you could end up finding a trap anywhere, or using it to disable a trap the GM has introduced with a move.  I almost want there to be a hold choice that lets you take back triggering a trap.  But I suppose if the GM has announced it correctly, you should have had a chance to use a hold to find it.<br/><br/>More generally, I think a lot of the moves in DW/AW can fall into the same potential trap you're talking about, Michael.  If the players know the GM will "only" make a hard move if they fail, they might try to avoid making rolls, which means less hard moves, and the whole thing can kind of sputter out.  The players/characters have to push ahead and act.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325128/#Comment_325128" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T12:14:05+00:00" title="May 18, 2011 12:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>If the left fork has an awesome scenario, and the right fork bypasses it completely, would you feel bad changing the location of the awesome scenario for the fun of the group?</blockquote>\nMaybe. <br/><br/>If by awesome scenario you mean "wicked deadly trap or lair" and by fork you mean "the players making an informed decision", then yes, maybe. <br/><br/>So, I guess I'm of the notion that maybe dungeons are designed to be passageways with clever traps and deadly inhabitants that protect the loot and by getting at the loot and extracting it alive, the players are overcoming the challenge. <br/><br/>If you're winging the entire dungeon, it makes total sense to wing everything. But, unlike John Harper, my prep would look far more in-depth I guess. <br/><br/>I might have "zones" with particular monsters roaming about with goals or behaviors, and the "hard move" or "random table" simply gives me an indication of what type of monster is moving through that particular place at that particular time. <br/><br/>So, taking the "cave goblin" example: <br/><br/>John said: <i>My prep is: "The cave goblins set crude traps to catch the unwary."</i><br/><br/>My prep would be: "The cave goblins have set crude spear gauntlets at the mouth of the cave to keep larger trespassers out. They use the hidden cave entrance behind the waterfall for entry. There's a narrow ledge at one point in the cave where the goblins can easily cross, but they've fashioned spikes at the bottom of the pit below the ledge and each of them carry small vials of slippery liquid that they'll toss down onto the ledge behind them if they are chased across." <br/><br/>My move and hard move doesn't change much from what's there. An "announce future badness" kind of move, that gives the PCs a clue as to a possible trap and then a hard move if the PCs fall into the trap or whatever. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cy</cite>We actually joked to the Thief about his looking for traps brining them into existence.  I see that as more of a feature than a bug.  Someone picks the Thief because they think traps are interesting challenges.</blockquote>\nAnd, this is a totally viable playstyle! Oh yeah! Don't get me wrong. <br/><br/>I was just under the impression all this time that Dungeon World was meant to emulate Old School B/X D&amp;D, and this is sounding more like it's emulating a "Story Now" cool ass adventure generator... Which is also fun as hell! Just different than my expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325131/#Comment_325131" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T12:21:24+00:00" title="May 18, 2011 12:21PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the players are avoiding rolls, I have two things to say:<br/><br/>1. There's probably something up with the social contract. Who showed up to NOT play badass adventurers doing stuff?<br/><br/>2. Avoiding taking action leads to golden opportunities leads to hard moves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My prep is mostly in John's mold, maybe with a bit more pre-mapping (I love taking a Tony Dowler map and just taking a few notes on it). That said, I think pre-placed traps can work. I'd be careful to stay flexible around them, since you don't know when you'll be making moves, but you can totally mark your map "ARROW TRAP HERE." You just have to realize that how the trap is sprung depends on how hard a move you're making when you bring it into play. If the players just walk into it, its a soft move. The easy choice being to announce impending doom: "you hear a THUNK as tiny arrow holes slide open in the walls..." If, on the other hand, they fail a move around it, you might make a harder move: "Thadius, as you're bearing down on the orc chieftan who's crawling towards his axe on the floor, you notice that arrow holes have just slid open on the walls. Are you staying standing to take out the orc, or dropping to the floor to avoid the arrows?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325144/#Comment_325144" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T13:07:49+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  1:07PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>That said, I think pre-placed traps can work.

That's great stuff. I sometimes go into that much detail, too. My cave goblins line was shorthand for one small part, not meant to be the <i>entirety</i> of my prep. (Although, to be honest, I've run games with less)<br/><br/>You can definitely do it by placing things ahead of time (even drawing out a specific dungeon with secret doors, traps, monsters and everything) Totally viable for DW. When I say that you should "look around at the fiction" to see what your move should be, you might be 1) looking around in your imagination of the fictional scene, 2) looking at the map of the fictional space, 3) looking at your specific prep about exactly what's there in that room, or 4) any combo of the above.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's all <b>fiction first</b>. That's where the old-skool "figure out the challenge" stuff comes in. There's no way in DW to "roll to beat the challenge" or anything like that. When confronted with weird and dangerous stuff, the players have to get in there and examine the fiction, and then say what the characters actually do. <i>Then</i>, the moves are triggered, or not, completely in the context of the precise fictional details. In that way, DW is a lot like classic OSR-style play (what Eero calls challenge-based play -- though there are some differences).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325208/#Comment_325208" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T16:57:57+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  4:57PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2011 12:44AM by John_Harper.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [ I revised my comment, and it turned into a blog post. ]<br/><br/><a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2011/05/apocalypse-world-guide-to-hard-moves.html" rel="nofollow">http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2011/05/apocalypse-world-guide-to-hard-moves.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325295/#Comment_325295" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T05:33:44+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  5:33AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on!
