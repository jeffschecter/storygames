I've been anticipating it, and fearing it. But my fears were unfounded.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13287.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13287.phtml</a><br/><br/>Here are 7 facts about the new edition of Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium.<br/><br/>1. The guy with the MP5 SD6 (silenced submachine gun) on page 129 is yours truly. Originally, it was a picture of me with a CETME rifle, but because this picture was taken as part of a discarded Ubisoft marketing campaign, I decided not to use it. Even though Ubisoft didn't do anything with it, it was still theirs. So I had my picture taken in my airsoft urban camo with the MP5 instead.<br/><br/>2. I wrote the Lovecraftian gangster rap on page 265. I was seriously considering a foray into nerdcore at the time. But in the end, I reconsidered. The lyrics were perfect for Dread, though. Gruesome, yet funny.<br/><br/>3. The ECG on page 10 is mine. Long story.<br/><br/>4. The book was supposed to come out on Valentine's Day. But there was a problem. I didn't know much about Photoshop, and was having trouble with the wraparound cover design. So I turned to someone I know, a guy who does book covers professionally. He quoted me an extremely reasonable price, and said that he could get it done by January. He delivered it several weeks late, and charged me <b>ten times</b> what we'd agreed to. I explained that this was unacceptable, and talked him down to something more reasonable. Frankly, I should have just told him to take a walk, considering how late he was, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Then he sent the invoice, which was more than we'd agreed to. I was furious, but I ground my teeth and I paid it. Bitter admission: because I knew the guy personally, I agreed when he said that a contract wasn't necessary. STUPID MISTAKE.<br/><br/>5. The cover design fiasco was a stroke of luck. Because of the delays that it caused, I hooked up with Adwen Creative, two friends of mine who had decided to start their own graphic design studio. They took my incredibly ugly two-column layout and turned it into something that's really cool to look at. Then they added all kinds of interior illustrations and created new cover art for me. So it all worked out okay. And I wound up not using the cover design created by the guy in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.<br/><br/>6. The first edition of Dread (Pandemonium) was published in 2002. The printer that I used charged me $1300 to print 100 copies, which I sold through my web site (mostly using PayPal). In the end, because of all the costs associated with the project, I just barely broke even. This time around, I'm using Lulu.com, so all of the costs are related to artwork or marketing. The upshot is, I was able to spend more on art and marketing, since printing costs were nil. This resuled in a higher-quality book.<br/><br/>7. I waited five years between editions mainly because my day job was pretty intense. After I quit my job and went freelance in 2006, I started thinking about the new edition of Dread. I'd been playtesting it for a while, coming up with new ideas and refinements. This, coupled with a development cycle of over a year (for the new edition), resulted in a better game overall. I think.<br/><br/>Okay, so there you go. My lessons learned.<br/><br/>Questions or comments are welcome!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96328/#Comment_96328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T10:39:19+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 10:39AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, like fine wine and cheeses, aging and playtesting<sup>1</sup> are key to properly developing RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd before you panic, yes I am working on my supplement right now.

I nearly released a new version of Dread a few years back, but life got too crazy, so I continued to just mull it over and keep refining it.<br><br>A lot of the material that's going to appear in later Books of Pandemonium is stuff that was actually scheduled for publication in the new edition of Dread, but then I realized that it would have kicked the page count up to 500+. Which is why there are going to be at least two more Books.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
