Both because it is awesome, and because it is perfectly-suited to my current gaming schedule (gaming with two different groups, neither on a regular basis, both with shifting members from session to session).<br/><br/>Some hard-earned wisdom:<br/><br/><b>Four players is the best number of players. </b>With three, you don't quite have enough going on to have the separate but overlapping schemes that lead to a true fiasco. With five, it's hard to keep every character's story pointed at the central mess. <br/><br/><b>Too many flashbacks/flash-forwards make for chaos.</b> A friend of mine who loves Fiasco (playing it was his birthday request), really digs jumping around in the timeframe, so much so that this has become our default mode of play. <br/><br/>At times, this is a great technique, and is super fun. Like, if we establish a scene with the policewoman and the pot dealer, who haven't been in a scene together yet, suddenly, two days later, confronting the crime boss about something that either of them were involved with so far, carrying another character's sack of money, figuring out HOW ON EARTH this happened is challenging and funny.<br/><br/>But if you do that a lot, scenes get too constrained by the needs of continuity. ("Well, we know that Frankie will be in the courtroom in an hours, hallucinating from snake venom, so I guess he has to run across some snakes in this scene..."). Because if you ignore continuity, you lose the power of the developing fiasco, and you're just playing "Crazy Collection of Unrelated Wacky Scenes".<br/><br/><b>Continuity is king.</b> The game's best moments, for me, often come from call-backs. Like with NPCs ... if Edward plays the trucker's wife as being obsessed with daytime TV, and paying little attention to her husband, and then I play her as a homicidal maniac for no apparent reason, that's much less funny than if I play her true to form, even if she's a minor walk-on character, and bring up her daytime TV fixation.<br/><br/><b>Recurring NPCs are fun.</b> Especially if you limit it to just a couple, and they come into contact with all the characters, so that different players have to pick them up from scene to scene, building on how previous players have handled them.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>These are probably pretty obvious, maybe too obvious to be worth sharing. Since <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13599" rel="nofollow">we all love Fiasco</a>, people must have similar, probably wiser, observations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309396/#Comment_309396" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T17:06:25+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  5:06PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes on all four points.

Now it's a couple of days later. You're tied to the chair in the hotel room, I've got the shotgun, and she's begging me to spare you. GO!" We play out that scene, and then spend a few scenes figuring out how it happened. That solves the biggest problem with GM-less games for us, that with so few constraints on your contribution, you get analysis paralysis, and go deer-in-the-headlights.<br/><br/>Also, we'll sometimes do scenes where one of the players isn't really satisfied with what happened, and they'll say, "OK, I don't really know why we were on opposite sides of the issue there. So let's go back, maybe a week before the first scene, and figure out our motivation. Why are we so upset at each other?"<br/><br/>Finally, in one game, we wound up playing a triple-cross heist kind of story. We played out a violent conflict early, left the outcome hanging, and then spent most of the game jumping around showing how one of the characters had tried to work both sides against the middle, but gotten outmaneuvered by one of the guys she was playing because she had underestimated his greed and capacity for brutality. Going back in time let us show the planning of the various con games, and let us spend enough time in establishing the motivations of the player that the Aftermath could be genuinely heartbreaking. It was the best Fiasco I've ever played, maybe the best RPG session I've ever played, in terms of the resulting fiction especially.<br/><br/>So - your mileage may vary, side effects may include CONfidence and Lucky Number Slevin, but I love playing the scenes anachronically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309569/#Comment_309569" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T13:48:20+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  1:48PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I prefer 5 players to 4.

With my anime convention playset I've found that people who've never been to an anime con really don't have enough of a hook to really get it, even if they're big time anime fans. Stuff like the Suburbia playset from the book is pretty universal, but there does seem to be a point where unfamiliarity hurts the game. So for example I'd be very hesitant to try <a href="http://dicemonkey.net/2010/10/06/toil-trouble-a-fiasco-playset/" rel="nofollow">that nifty-looking Harry Potter style playset</a> without a group that's reasonably familiar with the source material.<br/><br/><b>You can't be afraid to twist the knife.</b> While having one player be a sort of straight man can help the game, you really need to be willing to get a little twisted.

Making a few serious early commitments empowers everyone at the table, especially when it comes to establishing the characters. Waiting around to see if (e.g.) your guy is a badass or not, means we may never find out, and he may be flat and undeveloped for a long time. Go ahead and initiate a scene right away where the die color will tell you whether he's all talk, or a monster, and honor the result. If you do that in scene 2, then you've got almost the whole game for it to inform additional contributions to the fiction, which is a lot more helpful than delaying it until scene 10.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309598/#Comment_309598" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T17:59:22+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  5:59PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite><b>A certain kind of familiarity with the playset's subject material is necessary or at least desirable.</b></blockquote>\nSo I'm playing in my first game right now, we're using the Transatlantic playset.

I'm tempted to try six if people had the time but I feel it might get too complicated then. With five players there tends to be a lot more plot going on and people enjoy the sudden scenes where there are two ships passing each other in the night that will later end up at each other's throats.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllowing people to 'edit' scenes in order to create drama/problems is okay. The "What if I had been there in the background and overheard/recorded that" type of things. People don't usually think of them at the time, but later it comes up and everyone agrees that it would've been possible and cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nRandomly generating everything doesn't always work--sometimes it's better to pick things that would add to the game. I have played some awesome randomly generated games, and a couple that we struggled with. Now I usually do a mix with the game--the beginning is randomly generated, and towards the end people want to see the list to see what would make it even more insane. Then people start spending their die by choosing something. This has worked out really well and as I'm introducing a story game to normally mainstream players, they get really involved when they have just a bit more control over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the things I've learned with Fiasco is getting mainstream players into story gaming without being too frustrated in the process. Fiasco, I find, is great for that. The beginning takes a bit to draw them out, and once they notice the freedom of the game, they can go overboard. Trying to display a mid-ground to that is always good. As a result, though, I have lots of people that walk away wanting to play more story games.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have received complaints about: The playsets. I know they're awesome, and I know there are some fantastic ones. I have a lot of females at my table at any given time that automatically aren't interested in a lot of the historical settings just due to gender issues in those days. As a result, there are a bunch I've never played because people have the right to veto playsets based on what makes them comfortable. I've had one First Nations girl veto Boomtown (which I've loved and played) because the old west makes her uncomfortable due to the history of First Nations relations with settlers. A lot of men that come to the table are interested in the war-time ones. A lot of women that come to the table are interested in The Ice and the Rock Band Tour. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if anyone else has found this amongst their gaming experiences, but I find, more than most games I've played, that Fiasco is really affected by what genders are at the table. I'm not trying to polarize the genders into "Boys like war and girls don't" but it's what I keep coming across. I get a lot of "I wouldn't be comfortable playing a female in that era because it was so oppressive" and those type of details. I realize my friends are a lot of hardcore activists and such, but it wasn't a problem I was expecting to find with such an awesome game. That being said, they still love Fiasco, just not all the playsets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309981/#Comment_309981" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T18:49:16+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  6:49PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm not surprised that people prefer the longer, more complicated game with five players.

That was definitely a design goal! I'm really enjoying lurking in this thread and seeing what you all have observed.<br/><br/>Kate, I'm not surprised that some people are not excited about specific playsets. Some are edgier than others, but there's some uncomfortable stuff in all of them, I think. Honestly, there should be. If there are very specific elements someone is uncomfortable with, I think it'd be fine to call it out and not allow those elements to be chosen in the setup, but if it is the whole era or whatever, yeah, that's not going to work. <br/><br/>What is it about The Ice and Touring Rock Band that you think women are drawn to?  Those are both really popular playsets with everybody, and I'm not sure why (particularly for The Ice). Is it that they are contemporary? Removed from "normal" society? Extra gonzo?

People always get really excited about Antarctica when I read it out loud. The other one that gets a lot of play from my more male dominated games is Boom Town, because who doesn't enjoy the old west? After that, I'd say Gangsters of London is the third most popular, and that's mostly because people like British accents and there's just something about gangsters that's hard to turn down. I'm setting up my next bunch of Fiasco one shots through the club, and I'll see why people choose the playsets they do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI never really decide on a playset because I let my players decide. I'm excited to eventually try Dragonslayers, the new cthulhu one, and the one set in Elizabethan times (I believe it is).

In Fiasco, I've found that the initial situation often doesn't produce enough dramatic momentum to make this wise.  A certain amount of crazy shit needs to happen or the characters' quests can become mundane.  So, being less adept at injecting that mid-scene, my groups have taken to discussing where the game is going during scene-framing.  <br/><br/>The last time I played, after a lot of narratively logical but ultimately bland suggestions, I said to the group, "That wouldn't make a good Coen Brothers movie.  <b>What would make a good Coen Brothers movie?</b>"  The game improved dramatically from there.  I think we added more violence and absurdism, and pumped up the "powerful" in our "ambition".<br/><br/>Jason, do any of your playsets have much more grandiose ambitions than the ones in the book?

That said, every set has something truly awful with the potential for going completely, messily over the top. The Touring Rock Band set is, I think, the most aggressive about framing this. Flyover, while ostensibly pretty mundane, sets up some horrendous possibilities by implication.<br/><br/>I think my favorite example is from Tales From Suburbia: "Object: Untoward: Night vision goggles and flexi-cuffs".
