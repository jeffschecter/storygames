I plan on running a demo session of it in a few weeks but have a problem understanding a basic rule of the game. I've had two different TN GM's tell me it's done in different ways and I have trouble reading the correct answer from the rules.<br/><br/>So, here's an example to highlight my confusion:<br/>Player 1 and NPC 1 both have the verb Shoot at rank 3. Player 1 takes a shot at NPC 1, attempting to apply an adjective of "shot" or "bloddy" or whatever. So player 1 picks up 3 dice and adds push dice and yadda yadda yadda. His total ends up with a 4. So, here's where I get confused. Does NPC 1 roll his verb rating of dice (with possible push dice added in) and take the highest roll *or* is his verb rating of 3 the target number PC 1 is looking for, and he can add push dice and whatnot to increase that fixed number?<br/><br/>On the flip side, does a GM roll dice when the roles are reversed and NPC 1 is shooting back at PC 1? Or does he use the NPC's rating as a default roll result without rolling?<br/><br/>Maybe these are stupid questions but I just can't get my head around it for some reason and just need someone to clarify this to me. Thanks a million!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408122/#Comment_408122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T08:12:55+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  8:12AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Pheylorn:<br/>Page 104 and the example on page 105 has the answer, with some help from the earlier pages.<br/><br/>Player One (Paul) shoots at NPC 1 (Nancy). Paul rolls, trying to get a roll higher than Nancy's rating of 3. Nancy can spend push dice to raise her rating (one for one) (this is page 102). The return shot is the same, Nancy rolls and tries to beat Paul's rating.<br/><br/>The generic case is: aggressor rolls N skill dice plus some number of push dice, trying for a die to show higher than the flat value of the defender's applicable skill plus spent push dice. Hurt dice nullify a value, doubles give you a .1 (as a tiebreaker), ties go to the defender.<br/><br/>As for opposing skills, the common attacks chart on page 124 should cover you (Shoot is opposed by Move or Prowl generally, not Shoot).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408123/#Comment_408123" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T08:19:42+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  8:19AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a million <a href="/forums/profile/cathexis">@cathexis</a>.

Also, there are overview charts scattered around (the "common attacks" chart on page 124, the "contention" overview on page 93, presumably others), bookmarking those are good since they are a one-page spot for the overview.<br/><br/>EDIT: Two other things. First, never roll unless it's an opposed check, and that you only ever consider making a roll when you're trying to apply an adjective. Just doing things for the sake of doing them is automatic and free. Second, make sure everyone is comfortable with the ideas behind noir and hard boiled fiction, especially that part where they're going to get their asses kicked in the second act. Players need to spend Push dice to make lasting changes and the only way the players get them back is if you (the GM) start applying sticky adjectives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408162/#Comment_408162" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T12:55:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2013 12:55PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.
