                    A <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=111" rel="nofollow">thread</a> and a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/2006-08-20/blitheringly-obvious-epiphany/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> have got me thinking of a way that they should be some how connected.  There should be a way to encourage input from players in some fast trace like system.  There should be back-and-forth, maybe a way for players without any characters in the scene to add to the scene.<br/>
<br/>
Something like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> and <i>Wushu</i>.  Are there other games (published or in progress) that have this sort of back-and-forth-ness?                </div>

                            There were old story aides back during the late '80s that were cards to use with any RPG system.  They were called things like "Path to Intrigue" and "Path to Horror" that allowed the players to interject a scene, story element, or character based on a card they had drawn.  Their characters didn't have to be in the scene to use the cards as I recall.  The cards had trump numbers though, so that cards of lower priority couldn't be played to interupt a larger plot point.  The sets were mixable.  So a palyer could introduce a mysterious stranger or a hidden agenda for the GM to deal with in the story.  That type of concept may be modified with the trumps for your fast input idea.                        </div>

                            Aaron, that's certainly where my design work will be taking me, and on an increasingly smaller scale.  Introducing scenes and story elements is great and all, but a quick and maybe trance-like back-and-forth where players are shooting dialogue and actions and significant looks and significant backstory at each other -- that sounds pretty tasty.                        </div>

                            Hypothetical Set Up:<br><br>Odd number of players, right?  Players sit in a circle, with a hand of cards.  The cards have one word on each: And, But, Then, Until, Because.<br/><br/>Play goes around the table.<br/><br/>Player One narrates a bit of story: "Once upon a time, there was a noble knight who was in love with a beatuiful and virtuous maiden."<br/><br/>Player Two must play a card, reading the word off of the card as he does so: "But."<br/><br/>Player Three narrates the "but" to Player One's set up: "...there was a vicious and cruel King who coveted the maiden's beauty and conspired to kidnap her."<br/><br/>We'll say there's three players.  Now Player One must play a card and announce it: "Because."<br/><br/>Player Two now narrates the because: "...his wife, the most beautiful woman in the realm, had died young in childbirth, and had turned the King's heart cold and harsh."<br/><br/>And so on.  Play this as fast as possible, completing each other's sentences as much as possible to keep up a running "monologue."  So it's more like:<br/><br/><em>"Once upon a time, there was a noble knight who was in love with a beatuiful and virtuous maiden.  But there was a vicious and cruel King who coveted the maiden's beauty and conspired to kidnap her.  Because his wife, the most beautiful woman in the realm, had died young in childbirth, and had turned the King's heart cold and harsh."</em><br/><br/>No win conditions, no redraws or anything.  Just narrating and playing cards.<br/><br/>It's like... Once Upon a Time on speed.  I'm thinking, once you got it going, you could really get into the groove of it.                        </br></br></div>

                            I like the idea of cards.  And maybe I should be looking more at card games, both traditional and collectable.  They are generally fast and interactive.                        </div>
