Obviously there are similarities across the games, but I'm more interested in the differences.  <br/><br/><b>Example: </b>For the connections between characters we have Hx, Bonds, Strings, etc.  How are they different?  Which ones do what things well?  Which ones have let you down?<br/><br/><b>Different Example:</b> Each game seems to have a different take on awarding experience.  Which ones have led to realistic character change? Which ones have you found most satisfying?  Why?<br/><br/><b>A Third Example:</b> Your example.  Please give it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382501/#Comment_382501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-16T01:04:20+00:00" title="June 16, 2012  1:04AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Combat!</b><br/><br/>AW combat can get crazy and overwhelming (in the fiction, not the mechanics), but as long as you have armor you'll be okay (seriously, armor isn't foolproof but unless you're up against grenades, 2-armor is all you need). If you <i>don't</i>, you're going to die! Run!!<br/><br/>In Sagas of the Icelanders, combat is very simple, and extremely deadly. Given that the traditional Icelandic battle was a duel, this is appropriate. Armor makes no difference (at least in the current write-up). There are no hit points. You roll <i>accept a physical challenge</i> to see how well you fight, and then you roll <i>suffer harm</i> to see if you died or not. It's pretty rough, but it's great how intense it makes each combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382706/#Comment_382706" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T16:22:36+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  4:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with the Sagas combat.  I love the deadliness of it and how there are real consequences to fucking up.  I think one of my favorite things with xWorld games is that win, lose or draw, something exciting <i>always happens</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
