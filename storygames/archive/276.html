                    So, two years ago, when Iron Game Chef: Fantasy produced such wonderful games as <b>Polaris</b>, <b>The Mountain Witch</b> and <b>Seadog Tuxedo</b>, I had a little spate of inspiration, and wound up designing 3 entries.  Only one of those entries wasn't crap - <b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/atheneum/frigid.php" rel="nofollow">Frigid Bitch</a></b> (hereafter <b>FB</b>), which was since playtested several times.<br/>
<br/>
<b>FB</b> is already a fun game, if my memories of the playtests are any indication, but it always felt... klunky.  During the playtests and in other conversations with people, I was told it would make "a great board game."  At least one person (Vaxalon) said he didn't even consider it a roleplaying game in its current form.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, I couldn't figure out how to fix what I thought was wrong with it, and so it went on the top shelf, and only occasionally did I blow the dust off of it and look at it again.  I typed it out and fleshed it out once, thinking of selling it at a GenCon or something, but it seemed too small, and life got in the way anyway, and back on the shelf it went.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, it's come back down off the shelf.  I've decided that a game board might/should actually help the game.  Progressing along a board, I think, will be more intuitive than tracking Tale Points.  It would also give a nice visual indicator for the transition from 'Countryside' to 'Castle'.  Courting would, I think, be bundled up into Castle as semi-random encounters.<br/>
<br/>
My plan and hope is to add a board to the game, facilitate its play, but not make it into "just" a board game.  There will still be a Narrator/GM, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  The Countryside portion is simple - it's simply a path along the outside of the board, like a monopoly board that you go around once.  I've already got some very nice mechanical ideas for this part.  Basically, each spot tells you what kind of conflict there will be - Work, Gear or Heart.  Completely linear, more or less.<br/>
<br/>
It's the Castle portion that I'm getting stuck on.  The way I want to design the board, the Castle can't be more than 14 squares by 14 squares.  Somehow, I need to design the Castle and the rules surrounding it such that it encourages, if not requires, splitting up the group (who, up until this point, have been moving through the Countryside more or less together).<br/>
<br/>
I'm open to any ideas.                </div>

                            That sounds like a fine idea.<br>
<br>
Make a castle layout with some kind of obstacle (portcullises, say) that drop after someone passes thorugh them.                        </br></br></div>

                            Ideas, having not looked at FB at all:<br><br>Make the castle a series of paths that can only accomodate one player at a time/one player each.  <br><br>Have spaces that randomize forward direction.<br><br>Have obstacles that harshly punish everybody who comes in contact with them except the first person, and have threaded paths.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I believe I was thinking too complicatedly, and I have now arrived at a solution.  Here are the parts:<br>
<br>
(1) Each 'square' on the Castle can only fit one player.<br>
(2) Players are in competition as to trying to get to the Queen first<br>
(3) After each encounter, they are semi-randomly placed elsewhere on the board. So even if they try to stay together, they might not.<br>
<br>
Now I just need to playtest this.  I think OpenRPG might be the best bet here for online playtesting... it has a 'miniatures' type area that can be taken over for 'board' type play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
