After some time, it was laid out into book form, put on lulu, and sold for "Cost, plus one dollar: That dollar which would go to a charity."<br/><br/>So, we learned a lot from the experience. I think Jason was mentioning that he picked "the wrong license" or something for Creative Commons: Essentially, the book (which is awesome BTW, I use it in almost every session, particularly my L5R campaign) is priced high enough that it simply can never appear in a retail store. And what's more, it's like 11 bucks. For personal use, that's totally fine. But I was feeling the sting when I was buying about 5 of them the other day to take to Japan as gifts to my RPG friends over there, thinking "damn, I could have printed this with GoB or another POD for like $5 a pop, tops".<br/><br/>I'm wondering if a second project might be in order? Here's what I'm thinking:<br/>1) Figure out if the license from the original allows us to lift the content if the original authors give us permission (like me for the Egypt/Japan section, etc) and put it in another book.<br/>2) Choose a license as free of constraints as possible. Something on the "CRN" side of the fence even. Like, "anyone may print or use this, for whatever projects they want to do, forever and ever".<br/>3) Collect submissions to fill in the holes left by those entries we couldn't carry over from the original (or, going back to formula if the original license doesn't allow us to republish any of the material even with author permission).<br/>4) Find someone to lay it out for a paltry fee, like $100.<br/>5) I print it, something like 200 copies, using as cheap a printer as possible. The price of these copies will be "cost", plus "50 cents" (for the layout guy's fee), plus one more dollar (to go to some charity).<br/>6) After that, the print proofs are posted wherever, and people are free to print it as they see fit: Throw it on Lulu, give it to their local POD, whatever.<br/>7) If <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> is successful, I print 200 more, with the extra charity dollar, and so on.<br/><br/>This way, I'm thinking that "cost" might come down to something as low as like $5 per copy, depending on the printer. Possibly far less if we do a bulk printing (1000 books at two bucks a pop or something with a traditional printer).<br/><br/>...I guess this is just a public thought I was having the other day when I was picking up a couple of copies for friends, and thinking "dang, this could have been a lot cheaper", which Jason had also remarked on as well. Hindsight 50/50 and all that, but I'm wondering if it's time to think about a Second Edition at perhaps in the upcoming year...<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169227/#Comment_169227" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T15:53:00+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  3:53PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this idea but having not been here for the original call or posting I really don't know anything about this.

I even have the original files, so it'd be pretty simple to just throw new content into the old format (yay, XML!).

There's a small pool of income as a result  that will be donated to the Carter Center once it hits 100 USD.   It is 89.44 USD right now.<br/><br/>2.

All the individual files are <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/names/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, as text and .pdf.  <br/><br/>All that's required to make this happen:<br/><br/>1.  Get the permission from individual authors to re-use under a new license or no license or whatever.  You have mine!  Go nuts!<br/><br/>2.  Solicit new contributions.  I'll be eager to put some new stuff in.  At some point you'll have so much content you can choose only the best and most useful.

Even a free PDF is less easily navigated than a wiki or webpage with all the tables linked in a table of contents.  The main problem with an open wiki is 1) editing and 2) preventing spammers, which may require a more permanent, active community to remain engaged in the project over a longer period of time.  Maybe if it was a closed wiki that folks could request to have access to?

My intention is to have a print PDF (for the printer), and basically taking that very version and making it into a lighter screen/print version.<br/><br/>Brendan, Jason: Thanks for clarification on the existing license. Jason, later on I'll need your help telling one CC license apart from the next. Perhaps releasing all material as straight public domain would be easiest to deal with. Something to think about.<br/><br/>Layout: Josh, thanks man for volunteering to chip in. Actually, I have been meaning to learn some InDesign myself, so I might use this opportunity to take a crack at it (also see form factor, below). And yeah, I'm totally all about your idea on "text only". I might even require xls/Google Spreadsheet to boot.<br/><br/>Profit: Thinking about how to handle this. I can envision a cut for a layout guy (if one is used), and a fulfillment guy (to the tune of about $1 per book shipped) for the first 100-200 copies or so. Then, after that, the print PDFs will be made available so that if someone wants to print their own copies, they can take them to Guild of Blades or Lulu or wherever and do them themselves, for whatever price they care to charge (so that someone could keep it in print, sell it through IPR or whatever). I figure spare change can be donated to some charity if it manifests.<br/><br/>Art: Yeah, we'll probably lose the interior art, but I can look into that.<br/><br/>Advertising: This is a cool cost-saving idea, but it can also become Just Too Much to deal with. I'll think about this.<br/><br/>Previous contributors: When the time comes, we can contact all the previous contributors to see if they are interested in re-submitting.<br/><br/>Form factor: Currently, I'm not too married to 6x9, simply because I think 8x11 might be more economic in the use of space. I'm also looking at more of a rectangular form factor (so, 11x8 or 9x6) for the same reason: Economic use of space. I believe my X-something pages of Japanese names could have fit maybe on two back-to-back landscape 11x8 pages, including pretty borders and headers.<br/><br/>Additional Lists: While MOAR is almost always better, I think we have to be careful as well: There is enough "silly" content in the existing version I think, and I definitely want useful-at-the-table focused content. To that end, I'd be hard pressed to add more lists, rather I'd focus on expanding the ones that already exist (and add new lists only if they definitely fill a needed gap).<br/><br/>Gaming Content: Someone mentioned it in one of the other threads, and I agree: I love the lists that contain cultural tidbits of some sort: Clothing, food, scenario hooks, etc. To that end, I'd almost want, for every list, for there to be at least one "1-20" list of *something*, *anything* cultural to go along with it. It can be serious (clothing) or silly (like my "things found in a vending machine"), it could be oracle like (in other words, sentence fragments like "an old man in an elk hide, with rabbit bones in his hair"  "a medicine drum, worn through in a corner, handed down for four generations), or whatever. These can really make a lot of those name lists more usable, IMO. At the same time, it's a Names List, so that's the focus... the Other Stuff list would be a footnote that makes the names more usable. A pinch of spice, like.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'd encourage more judicious editing, rather than a "submit it and we will put it in" attitude.</blockquote>\nAhh, yeah, in other words, This Here. I'd not be like, "We already have Polish, why do we need Hungarian", but rather "Do we need another list of Retro-Future Laser Princesses? We already have two Edgar Rice Burroughs lists... sell me on it", etc. And I'd totally favor lists that also included cultural info, scenario hooks etc.<br/><br/>Wiki: Yuck. That is, for formatting for the book, I'd want it in a template. But someone can take all the data later and wiki it up themselves if they want.<br/><br/>The Important Thing: This is going to move slow, like a giant sea turtle with a city resting on its shell. We here tend to explode into action and excitement, what I'd like to do is start slowly, with measured, calculated actions aimed at slowly producing solid results.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone. Keep suggestions or thoughts incoming. Once I hit a critical mass with organization, we'll see things start moving.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169393/#Comment_169393" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T08:47:07+00:00" title="September 16, 2008  8:47AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also change your license so you get perpetual reprinting ability for charity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169396/#Comment_169396" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T08:51:57+00:00" title="September 16, 2008  8:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, if the license was open enough (like, for instance, Clinton-open, where all you have to do is credit the list compilers and the SGNP) you wouldn't actually need to pay a layout guy.

Yeah, the charity thing is kind of an afterthought. I'm thinking of basically putting together 1-2 hundred copies when it's all "done"/"organized" in order to, well, get it out there and all that at a really low cost. I figure the best way to do that is basically round dollar amounts, and give that loose change to a charity or something. <br/>Ransom model is sexy. Probably counter-productive here, though.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm aiming for what we're referring to as "Clinton-Open" here ("Clinton-Open" should be a valid CC license name). If that basically amounts to a comparable "CC" name/license/wording, that works. But what I'm looking for amounts to basically a stamp that says "use this in any way you see fit, for whatever you want". I have no knowledge of CC, and the website makes by brain-box hurt as I shift gears out of the world of computer storage hardware and networks into Western-centric legaleze so I can't really tell the difference from one to another (or the difference between, say, "CC-Attribution" and "Public Domain"). I just know that Clinton does his games all CC in one license or another. I just need to track down, say, Inuma, find the license on that, read up on it, and basically use that one. Or something.<br/>(edit: I see that Inuma is "Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.5 Generic": I'd probably go for similar, but allowing for Commercial: "Attribution Share Alike"?).<br/><br/>But then, of course, I'd want to jump in, do a little layout, and print up some copies to start the ball rolling.

I re-license it at CC-Attribution on release now.<br/><br/>ShareAlike generally isn't a great idea: it forces the hand of anyone who would re-use your work, and makes them use the same license, which isn't awesome.<br/><br/>For a good real-world example, the BSD Unix operating system uses a license much like CC-Attribution, where you can do what you like with the software, commercial or non-commercial, open-source or not. Linux uses the GNU license, which is a lot like CC-ShareAlike. This is one of the reasons Apple's OS X - now the largest Unix-based OS on desktops in the world - used BSD as its core, because they could. They've made great progress for BSD, but couldn't have done that with a share-alike license.<br/><br/>(Also, be aware, this discussion causes flamewars the world over, and my opinion is just that, an opinion.

Made Up Plus Useful is still useful in my book (like the one which basically amounts to "names for your Firefly-inspired game", or Conan-inspired names: Stuff that may be Made Up, but still very very applicable to the gaming table), and I'll probably keep some of the more silly yet still possibly usable name lists, especially if flushed out more. But I'll probably not recruit any further for those. And when I say that, I of course mean "...for the version I intend to print and ship". If someone wants to create and compile tons of silly lists for their own versions, then they are totally free to rock out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>And the lists from the first book that included some cultural notes and pronounciation guides and the like...those are gold...more of that.</blockquote>\nYeah, that sounds like something to encourage, if possible.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Oh and in addition to names...forms of address.

So if you've got excellent small town names, you could throw those in, but if you've got 20 different kinds of shoes, what the hell, go nuts.  But everything has some hook to localize it with fun details beyond a name dump.  It'd be really spectacular if the minimum submission requirements formed a one page standard, too - there are a few lists in the first book that are really sparse and don't fit well because of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174005/#Comment_174005" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T21:29:05+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  9:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 9:31PM by Andy.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK all, just FYI: The wheels are slowly turning, this is totally in my mind now. I'm going to make it happen. It's just going to be a little time. If I can in the next week or so, I'll throw down some thoughts on submission guidelines, rules, etc. It might be a few weeks until you see an official "Contribute!" thread, but just know the wheels are turning.
