Good ones anyway.  I hate the ones with extraneous background noise, etc.,.  The worst place to record one is in a busy convention gaming room.  Ugh.<br/><br/>AP podcasts are some of the best ways to find out about a new game before buying it.  It's excellent for that.<br/><br/>An excellent example of a quality AP podcast would be The Game Master Show's sessions of Don't Rest Your Head.  I bought the game half way through listening to the 2nd episode.  It was also very interesting listening to a group who's experience was mostly with traditional games play a story game.  The people on the Game Master Show are also incredibly cognizant of the fact they are being recorded and keep table talk, stupid jokes and the like to an absolute minimum.<br/><br/>I don't want to list the ones I think are the worst, but I'd say for every good AP podcast, there are 10 bad ones.  Table talk, background noise, meandering conversation, etc., gets me to turn it off right away.<br/><br/>I want people to keep producing AP podcasts on the off hand chance that I'll find the 1 in 10 that's not totally awful.  If you make AP podcasts, keep it up, and help us listeners out by cutting out table talk, stupid jokes, background noise, and unrelated chit chat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123571/#Comment_123571" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T19:48:10+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:48PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off in my Audio APs I tend to shave off excess space and chatter cutting them down by almost an hour.<br/><br/>I don't expect people to listen to the whole thing but you help me focus in on an idea I've had recently where I play 20 minutes of a game to illustrate a point.<br/><br/>My goal for listening to game play is to see how other people play.  We were playing Burning Empires MUCH different from Luke's crew.  I think hearing Luke's group run through a session would be VERY useful, especially in a game as dense as BE.  I can see how Polaris would be fun to listen to.  It would be cool to see how GMs handle certain rules and abstractions, how people make decisions and where dysfunction crops up and how it's handled.<br/><br/>I don't think listening to game designers has any particular merit.  Sure, they have a vision for the game but if a game works a certain way for an unattached play group I think there is a lot more to learn about the game there.  Comparing the two is the most worthwhile.<br/><br/>Mel and I have been talking about trading Audio APs and comparing points.  Once I get the apps and techniques down, making editting easier then I hope to manage more of these.  I am even thinking of doing an AP Podcast that uses these as a segment of the podcast while interviewing GMs and players about the game.  Sorta like a movie commmentary.<br/><br/>How do I listen.  It's pretty passive.  I am exercising, manual activities, on the bus - stuff like that.  I don't think I would ever sit down and listen word-for-word, minute-by-minute.<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123573/#Comment_123573" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T20:39:01+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  8:39PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2008 8:40PM by Andy.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason: I'm really bad at listening. The only thing that held my attention audio-wise for more than a few minutes next year were Godzilla Gaming Podcast and the audio book of World War Z.  Personally, I like reading Replays (every now and then, not like for Every Session of a campaign or anything like that), there's something about the organization and focus that I love.<br/><br/>But man, the closest thing I've seen to a great audio actual play with a Purpose is Rafael's Dreadcast.  I, too, tried to listen to Eruditus' Psi Run cast to try to help him out, or rate his style or whatever, but I have a low attention span and just couldn't get over the fact that I was listening to others having fun, without getting anything in return. I tried to think about it in a critique point of view and all, but I couldn't wrestle with it for more than 2 minutes at a time. Not that he's boring, it's just that it turned out to be not my thing.<br/><br/>But the Dreadcast is the closest I've seen in the feel of Japanese-style Replays: That is, presenting it in a way that is appealing and perhaps enjoyable to the reader.  It's part actual play, part radio drama, and very different than most actual play recordings. Give it a brief listen or skip around it a bit. I again didn't have the attention span to listen to it end-to-end (I might load it up on my workout iShuffle and see if I can go end to end on it), but I listened to it, and had far more FUN listening to it, than the normal drab actual plays. The music, narration, cuts and stuff really focus and tighten the work into something enjoyable to listen to.<br/><br/>Again, Rafael shows us all up by coming out of Left Field and kicking ass in his own particular way. I look forward to, as they say on the internets, "MOAR".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123575/#Comment_123575" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T20:50:53+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  8:50PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>Is it an effective way to learn to play a game you don't know?<br/>Is there a participatory or vicarious thrill?<br/>Do you feel a connection to the players/podcasters when it is over?<br/><br/>I'm assuming I don't know what I'm talking about (that's the way to bet, generally), so straighten me out!

I'm a big audiobook fan, so it fills the same niche: Background noise for doing various tasks like doing dishes that seeps into the subconscious and provides the germ for ideas.  I also listen to them to see if other people are doing things around the table that are interesting or novel.

When I try to listen to AP I get bored out of my skull and end up reading something while I'm listening. At that point, the podcast just becomes background noise until I realize I can't remember anything I've listened to. The notable exceptions are Virtual Play in the segments where the AP is cut up into bite sized chunks bookended by discussion of some gaming point (even here some segments go on too long) and Paul Tevis' Polaris game, which I attribute to the ritual phrase mechanic cutting way down on side conversations and structuring the play more like a narrative that the listener could follow. Being very interested in how the mechanic worked in play helped too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123595/#Comment_123595" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T23:10:46+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 11:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2008 11:10PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

I can however get a thrill out of listening to great gameplay; players doing interesting things with the system, or great protagonist changing moments.

Don\u2019t tell me how great it was, show me!\u201d <br/>I also do like listening to complete games\u2014for entertainment, for \u2018instruction\u2019 on playing a game, as a souvenir of play.  I\u2019ll normally listen to long segments when I\u2019m driving (which I don\u2019t do that much, except to conventions!); and shorter segments at home when I\u2019m looking for excerpts for Virtual Play.  <br/>Don C. and my brother Bill White have started sending me files of their games, which I listen to\u2014again with an \u2018ear\u2019 for the show.  This is a bit like work!  Normally, it\u2019s just entertainment.  But listening with the hope of hearing something that sparks a discussion makes me realize that, not having been there, it\u2019s difficult to fully understand what\u2019s going on.  Ideally, as Judd mentioned, the participants themselves would be part of the discussion.

I've seen it (the fact of recording) change behavior.  So far, it's mostly been in terms of whispering or delaying talking so as not to have multiple conversations going on at the table at once.  This is probably a 'good thing' whether recording or not, because it keeps everyone in the game.  But I don't want the event to seem artificial--aren't there many studies that show people change their behavior when they know they are being monitored?  I cringe a little when we take a break and someone asks if I want to turn off the recorder--I want it to be forgotten!  <br/>That being said, I do try to make understanding what's going on easier for the listener.  I try to avoid pronouns; I try to make clear who is acting at a specific time; I try to make clear when something we're doing is not in accord with the rules as written; and I think the dice rolls are normally announced anyway.  For Ganakagok, I try to describe the image on the card or the card name--leading to a comment I'll never forget:  a player describing "two walruses battle" as 'more like two lawn chairs battle!'  In many cases I am pointing these things out so that it's easier for me, as the future listener, to recall what happened so that I can talk about the scene.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123667/#Comment_123667" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T07:52:38+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  7:52AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried to listen to a couple of AP podcasts, and found myself zoning out really, really quickly, even though I really _wanted_ to be interested.<br/><br/>However, I like the idea of "recorded demo play", designed for listeners as a demo or explanation of how games work, etc. One good resource to go to might be to check out some old radio theatre.

I've heard of other groups taking a whole three, four hour game session to come up with the perfect pitch. After listening to the AP recording, my pitch sessions last around thirty minutes, give or take ten minutes. These aren't just with my regular gaming group; this is with pickup groups at conventions and game days.  Even though I didn't like the show they came up with, those first thirty or forty minutes of the AP recording are gold for instruction.<br/><br/>I occasionally listen to AP records if there's a game that I'm interested in but don't know how to play to see how a group handles the game and possibly to see how long it takes to play certain aspects of the game.  Such as in this combat-heavy game, how long does combat take? Does it sound like cool things are happening at the table or is it abstract dice rolling and number crunching? Are the players doing things because they sound cool or are they doing things to maximize chances of succeeding?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Those of you who record your sessions:  To what degree are you conscious of the fact that you are recording, and how does that change your play?

I expect that the game session will start with us introducing ourselves and the character we'll be playing so the development team can get an idea of who is whom, but once the session starts, the iRecorderthing will just be another thing that's piled in the middle of the table. Hopefully we'll remember to turn it off when the session is over. I'd like it to work that way so the developer can hear what and how a gaming group approaches their game in a real setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass" title="BigJackBrass"><img alt="BigJackBrass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/576/nNQFOT4MURTFT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass">BigJackBrass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123712/#Comment_123712" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T10:06:24+00:00" title="February  1, 2008 10:06AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started listening to a variety of podcasts when I started working in an office, mainly because I needed something to drown out the horrendous sound of commercial radio playing at the other end of the room (since for some reason I can't work with that in the background, but manage perfectly well when listening to something of my own choosing.) The first "actual play" recordings I listened to were RPGMP3.com's <i>World's Largest Dungeon</i>, Yog Radio's <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i> and various recordings by the RoleMonkeys, after which my group began recording our own sessions.<br/><br/>The games I'm actually in are something I listen to mainly for purposes of information, particularly handy when I'm running something: on several occasions I've picked up on things that were said at the table but missed by me during the game, and it's handy to get an overview of when the players seem to be more or less interested in events. As far as other games go, the ones I listen to for entertainment, it tends to be the players who really make the difference. I've heard a number of games played rather straight and dull and... oh gods, the tedium. On the other hand, listening to a group of friends having a good laugh and a damned good time helps my day to go faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123728/#Comment_123728" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T10:43:41+00:00" title="February  1, 2008 10:43AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Listen to Fred's Escape or Die AP from Dreamation (that's how we roll, ep2): it's fun!</blockquote>\nQFT.

Two of them are actually fairly into seeing how economies operate.

I have attention-span (and time-availability) issues that have pretty much torpedoed my ability to listen to AP shows in general.  The stuff really has to be on point to work for me.  <br/><br/>But I want to be able to hold up certain examples without having to type a lot -- a LOT -- of text into a web form or whatever.  The podcast's going to give me a chance to do that.  It'll also serve as an ability to show people Evil Hat's game ______ in action, and in the case of playtest recordings, may give us a chance to drum up some advance interest in the game among people who DO listen to AP 'casts.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll publish every session I have.  Setting creation for my home game was a fairly intense experience, though -- a lot of focus on the purpose of the session.  I've got another 2 unpublished hours of it and it's fairly packed -- I've listened to them all at least once or twice so I could put together my notes for the game, leading to the setting glossary I put up on my LJ: <a href="http://drivingblind.livejournal.com/326248.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow">http://drivingblind.livejournal.com/326248.html#cutid1</a><br/><br/>Similarly, Escape or Die!'s playtest at Dreamation had very little downtime in it -- and Rob, don't feel sheepish about plugging your game in there, intentional or not; I'm eager to see your game get some exposure too.  And I figured it'd be useful to be able to put up a single 2-hour recording of it and say "see? this game runs in 2 hours or less for six players who've never seen it before".  That's useful to me from a marketing perspective.<br/><br/>So as someone creating these things, they have value to me as a "multimedia" way of presenting data about the stuff I do to the world.  I don't expect lots of people to tune in (THWR#1 has only about 100 downloads at this point, the EOD session about half that) but I do figure those who do tune in will have a pretty high "hit ratio" in terms of being people I'd *want* to reach.  The comments have been good!<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I think my goal -- which I won't always hit -- for putting up a recording with as little editing as possible (it needs to stay fun, and editing is a chore), but with the intensity of experience dial maxed up reasonably high, so it's an hour or whatever of relatively interesting stuff.  And while my EOD! recording was slightly over 2 hours long (for continuity) in general I'm going to try to post things in one-hour-or-less *chunks* -- because those fit a single long commute reasonably well (at least in the DC area) and can be burned onto an audio CD for those who don't have MP3 players.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Heh... now Fred will have to give us further data about EoD!<br/></blockquote>\nThe character sheet has a bunch of text on it that I'm not sure people are actually using in play, but it acts as a 'board" for each person's personal "board game" they're playing while trying to either escape or die.  It's where 90% of the rules for the game currently live, too.  I'm going to be transitioning to a new design in the future, when I get closer to publication, since a lot of those rules will leave that page and get into a little booklet where they can be given some room to breathe.<br/><br/>But let's not talk about EOD! too much here -- if you want to dig at it some more, please start another topic discussion (and let me know about it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123867/#Comment_123867" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T18:35:09+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  6:35PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, an audio play guide, especially if it's a ten minute synopsis, is a terrific idea.
