I am wondering if there would be any cool RPGs that could be played during a car trip. <br/><br/>PTA for example, would be terrible. There are the character sheets, the need to lay down numerous cards and the use of chips, etc... I don't think Polaris, IAWA, Grey Ranks would work either. Best Friends could work but it is unplayable by 2 players. TEAO Baron Munchausen could work but it is not a very good game.<br/><br/>Recs and personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Thanks                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191429/#Comment_191429" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T12:15:39+00:00" title="February  6, 2009 12:15PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Previously discussed <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7756&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7757&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">here</a>; maybe helpful ideas there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
