My experience is that librarians are very happy about this type of culture activity; both roleplaying and boardgames (the types of events I've arranged) fit well with the librarist cause, and at least in Finland libraries are in this age looking for this exact sort of enlivening activity to bolster their traditionally literature-oriented services. So I think it's a great idea.<br/><br/>Just about the only tips that I have concern the type of event you're arranging (whether you're gaming with friends, or if it's a publicized special event at the library, or what), and that's mostly the same in a library as it would be anywhere else: choose the right game(s) and take your wits with you. If you'll explain a bit more about the goals of the event, we might look into specifics.<br/><br/>Perhaps a minor pointer about playing in a public space: remain aware of where you are, use voice appropriately (civilized, measured and gentlemanly - pretend that you're engaging in a refined culture pastime), close down the session when you promised to do so, clean up after yourselves, and thank the venue for hosting. Stay behind to chat about it if it's some sort of special event the library is trying out, so as to share your observations. Common sense stuff all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431052/#Comment_431052" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T16:57:49+00:00" title="April 15, 2014  4:57PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd add to that a reminder that, to the average mundane, what we do looks <i>very </i>weird, so be careful how you appear to other library users.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
