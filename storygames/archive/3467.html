As I'm getting back in to the hobby, I'm finding all these great "new" games (DitV, Burning Wheel, Donjon, Shock:), rediscovering old school favorites (Traveller, Gamma World, Basic FRPG), and enjoying some tremendously cool new resources and communities (Story Games, Knife Fight). It's kind of like getting reacquainted with an old friend and finding out he's even cooler than when you were kids.</p>\n<p>All of this stuff, conversations both online and off, plus the cancellation of <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> magazines has inspired me towards my next project.</p>\n<p>It will be an online magazine, of sorts, inspired very much by <em>Dungeon</em>, but with an emphasis on story. Specifically, heroic fantasy adventure. There will be both full-fledged adventures, and simple plot seeds. I'm thinking I'd also like to do a print edition; possibly a collection of complete adventures inspired by the plot seeds published either once or twice per year.</p>\n<p>I'd like to try to maintain a frequency of one or two new adventures and five to ten new seeds per month on the site itself.</p>\n<p>All of the content would use a special form of notation allowing you to plug it into whatever rules you use. This notation system will be largely based on Fudge, and I'll include conversion guidelines for some of my favorite games. Everything will be "generic," too; no use of commercial worlds, races, monsters, etc. This isn't just to avoid law-suits, but to ensure that the stories are as playable as possible for any group.</p>\n<p>That all seems very simple to do, but I'm wondering... should I add a few more things? I'd like to get people's feedback on what they think would make it the best site like this... ever! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p>\n<p>Here's some of the ideas. Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p><strong>Forays in to other genres.</strong> Although the concentration would be on fantasy, there would be the occasional stories for space-opera, post-apocalypse, modern fantasy, etc. I had also thought that I maybe I could revamp one of my semi-abandoned projects (<a href="http://scruffyco.com/voyagers/" rel="nofollow">http://scruffyco.com/voyagers/</a>) and retool it as a sci-fi version of this idea. Of course... that would mean running <em>two</em> sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Campaign/Adventure Settings.</strong> Nothing major like you would find from a commercial world setting, but things like kingdoms, towns, etc. Almost like extended seeds, but concentrating on setting rather than story.</p>\n<p><strong>New monsters/races and stand-alone NPCs.</strong> Is there enough of that already? Would it be too far away from the emphasis on story?</p>\n<p><strong>Editorial pieces.</strong> Reviews, thoughts, interviews... the typical stuff.</p>\n<p>I also want to try to get submissions from other people for the site. I highly doubt that this site will make any money whatsoever. I've always felt, though, that even if submitting to a small, low or no-income site; contributors should be somehow compensated above getting their name linked to their homepage. Would a free copy of the print edition be enough?</p>\n<p>And lastly...</p>\n<p>I've been playing around with a possible design for the site. If you'd like to see it, it's at <a href="http://scruffyco.com/adventures/" rel="nofollow">http://scruffyco.com/adventures/</a>. It's just a "rough sketch" right now. It's incomplete, filled with dummy text, and nothing works; but I'd love feedback on it, anyway. (I should note that I haven't looked at it in any version of Internet Exploder. I usually wait until I've got the whole thing done, and then go back and fix it for the "slow kid" of the browser world.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78240/#Comment_78240" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T15:51:59+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  3:51PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would highly recommend that you identify one thing -- specifically one "product" that other people can use -- and figure out how to make that one thing as accessible, engaging, and powerful as you can.  Then deliver that one thing and do so reliably.<br/><br/>It sounds like your 'one thing' is plug-and-play fantasy adventure ideas.  Go with that.  Don't worry about other genres, wholecloth settings, or random other fiddly bits.  Do your one thing and do it well -- you can branch out when you have the one thing down pat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78242/#Comment_78242" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T16:03:07+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  4:03PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Joshua.
