Probably against my better judgement but I've an itch to document my struggle against not-getting-any-gaming and my efforts to change that this summer and even though my last try with blogging didn't really work, I'm willing to give it another try. <br/><br/>(I think it was Judd and his Star Wars idea that pushed me over the edge. No, I don't really know why...)<br/><br/>Anyway, so I'm looking for a blogging software. Last time, I tried the hosted version of Worldpress, IIRC, (ie. not on my own server), but now that I have webspace and bandwidth to waste, I figure setting up my own blog is more interesting and gives me more option than relying on free blog-farms. <br/><br/>So now, I'm searching for a (relatively) easy to use blogging software for my website. Preferably something simple that's comfortable and easy to navigate, both for me and anybody who happens to actually read it. Basically, I'm looking for something that is to Blogs what Vanilla is to message boards. ^_^<br/><br/>(I know that there's a mod that turns Vanilla into a Blog, but installing a second board besides Story-Games.at is probably more hassle then it's worth.)<br/><br/>So, blogging people of SG, can you help me? Any software that you can recommend? Any that I should absolutely avoid?<br/><br/>Aaron                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78720/#Comment_78720" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T09:37:34+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  9:37AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aaron, if you liked the back-end of WordPress that you used at wordpress.com, you can install WordPress on your own site.

(Yeah, helpfull, I know...)<br/><br/>I'm kicking myself now that I didn't write it in the OP, but I've figured that I could always install Wordpress if nothing interesting came up and so was kinda looking for alternatives, blogs that do things differently, in fun or interesting ways. (For example how Vanilla uses Whispers instead of PMs and so on. This kind of interesting/fun/different.) Sorry, should've got a bit more into the detail.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm browsing a bit through <a href="http://opensourcecms.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenSourceCMS</a>, a site that hosts demos of a whole bunch of Blogs/Wikis/CMS', looking for something that appeals. One thing that stood out so far was WikiBlog, which is, well, the bastard-child of a Wiki and a Blog, but it seems a bit complicated.<br/><br/>Well, I'll keep browsing and maybe somebody recommends be other blogs and if not, I'll probably pester you all with WordPress-Installation Problems soon anyway. ^_^<br/><br/>M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78750/#Comment_78750" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T10:57:48+00:00" title="June 29, 2007 10:57AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your host has the intestinal fortitude, there are Rails-based solutions like <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/" rel="nofollow">Mephisto</a> and <a href="http://radiantcms.com/" rel="nofollow">Radiant</a>.<br/><br/>Some WordPress veterans have started an interesting project called <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/" rel="nofollow">Habari</a>...
