(GMed it, to be exact.) It was fun, but we've had some difficulties with the conflict resolution system, and particularly with its social aspect (when it's just talking).<br/>There were two main problems:<br/>1) What happens when somebody wants to enter an ongoing conflict in the middle? First we figured he'd just roll the appropriate dice and step right in, but that gives him a huge advantage - he's got fresh dice and didn't to see any of the previous blows. For instance, there was an argument between one of the dogs and an NPC, and the other two dogs were for the time being staying out of the argument. Later, one of them decided that wanted to intervene on the side of his fellow dog - so now he rolls all of his dice, but if he'd been in the conflict from the start, he'd be needing to see the NPC's arguments (which would probably affect both of the dogs, as they were on the same side). Ruling that you can't enter a conflict midway doesn't look right, though. I think this is more of a problem when the conflict is only talking. It makes sense for you to stand and say nothing while your friend is arguing, it makes less sense for you to stand and do nothing while your friend is in a shoot-out.<br/>2) Now, specifically for the social side of things. The way things work, three versus one is an almost guaranteed victory for the three. In combat that makes sense, but when it's only arguments it's somewhat weird - I mean, an argument is an argument, the fact that three people are repeating it doesn't make it THAT much stronger.<br/>Also, in situations when one NPC is arguing against several dogs, he raises and then all of the dogs need to see - but in the case of an argument it doesn't really make much narrative sense. Once one of the dogs answered, that's it, it's answered. Seeing with 'yeah, what he said' seems silly. (And if only one of the dogs needs to see each time, it makes the NPC's chances of winning even more impossible). <br/><br/>To tell the truth, there was something of a temptation to skip through the social part and bring in the dice only when things became physical, but I think that'd seriously break the system.<br/><br/>Did anyone else encounter those problems? If so, how did you handle them? I'm guessing we simply didn't get how to properly use the mechanics to our advantage.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351108/#Comment_351108" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T15:28:05+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  3:28PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ODDin</cite>What happens when somebody wants to enter an ongoing conflict in the middle?</blockquote>\nOn page 63, in the section on Improvised Things, there's a paragraph that starts: "Occasionally a character will burst into a conflict already in progress." It explains how you're supposed to use the rules for people coming into a conflict in the middle. (Or, if one of the participants in a conflict isn't happy with how it's going, they can always Give and then start a new conflict with a different set of participants.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ODDin</cite>I mean, an argument is an argument, the fact that three people are repeating it doesn't make it THAT much stronger.</blockquote>\nIn order to be a valid raise something has to be something that the opponent "can't ignore". If someone's just repeating something, or doing the equivalent of a "Nuh uh!" "Yuh huh!" it might not be a valid raise. If the conversation has moved on past a point, making the same point again might not be a valid raise.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ODDin</cite>Also, in situations when one NPC is arguing against several dogs, he raises and then all of the dogs need to see - but in the case of an argument it doesn't really make much narrative sense.</blockquote>\nWhen I describe the conflict rules, I like to say that seeing is about how you take the hit, not how you respond to it (that's your next raise). If the opponent raises with "you Dogs are just bullies, you don't really represent the King of Life!", each person has to see that because it might affect each of them differently (maybe one of thinks it's just the idle talk of a deluded sinner, maybe it confirms another one's deepest fear). You might include in-character dialog in your see (maybe you're articulating a rationalization for why what the other person says isn't valid), but the see isn't really about affecting other people with what you say, it's about how what the other person said affects you. A lot of us experience real-world arguments as shouting with turn-taking where we ignore what the other person says, so this "how does what they said affect me?" step isn't always intuitive. Dogs wants you to explicitly think about whether the things the other person is saying are affecting you. I think it's a lot easier to see how the steps work in a fistfight, where the differences between blocking and taking the blow are more familiar, so it's a little unfortunate that most conflicts start with talking where things are a little bit less intuitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351110/#Comment_351110" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T15:38:28+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  3:38PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>A lot of us experience real-world arguments as shouting with turn-taking where we ignore what the other person says, so this "how does what they said affect me?" step isn't always intuitive.</blockquote>\nWhat a great sentence!

But, as you can see, just letting people join in can "break" the system, so by the book it's simply not allowed.<br/><br/>If you want to get involved in a conflict under way, you have two options:<br/><br/>1. You can "help", by acting as an improvised item.<br/><br/>2. You could borrow the rule from "Afraid", which allows you to join a conflict at the point when it escalates. However, to determine what dice you roll, you pretend that you've already been in the conflict. So if it's talking (Acuity + Heart) going to guns (Acuity + Will), you ONLY roll your Will, not Acuity. (Because, just like the people already in the conflict, you should have rolled your Acuity at some point already.)<br/><br/>I once let a player join a conflict by rolling in Traits and Belongings, and not rolling any Stat dice at all. It still can mess with the system, though, so it's not a great solution either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351761/#Comment_351761" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T22:42:59+00:00" title="December 16, 2011 10:42PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I may I suggest looking up Vincent's Afraid game, it is a not published horror game using a variation of the dog's rules.
