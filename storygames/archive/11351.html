The threads about Maid have recently brought up hyper-sexualized images (among other issues). Arguably, men often get the same treatment in art... hulking Conan-esque warriors who are always in scantily-clad muscle shots, like the cover of Men's Fitness or something.<br/><br/>And if that's your perfect ideal of sexuality, awesome. The world is so your oyster.<br/>But if it's not... and you find those images crass and empty and trite... or worse things like oppressive and victimizing...<br/><br/>then I beg you: show me an image from a roleplaying game that you find genuinely sexy (or sensual, or steamy, or hot, or deeply romantic).<br/><br/>Don't post it in this thread, instead link it... and quickly describe what's in it. The reason I say that is to avoid posting images others may find offensive. I don't want to bar people from participating. So if you want to post a picture with a naked woman, just post the link and say "female nudity involved" or something. Cool!<br/><br/>By "image from a roleplaying game", I mean a pretty diverse set of things. Cover art, fan art, character art.... it's all good. Any art that was created to fuel collective storytelling counts.<br/><br/>AND! Explain a bit about what you find so sexy, or why it's sexy to you, or your reactions to it, or others reactions to it, or anything juicy like that.<br/>Yes!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252242/#Comment_252242" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T15:18:14+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  3:18PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2010 4:24PM by Mcdaldno.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll start.<br/><br/>I'm a really big fan of some of the early art that was used for Pathfinder adventures. They consistently featured powerful, badass chicks who looked so self-assured and focused and alive with personality. They're consistently hot without that being "the point", or the reason they are there. They are there to kick your ass, and they are gorgeous.<br/><br/>My favourite being this paladin: <a href="">http://paizo.com/image/content/RiseOfTheRunelords/Pathfinder7_Paladin.jpg</a><br/>Yeah. Self-assured, a visionary, a leader, powerful, hot. I've never seen someone look hotter in full platemail.<br/>She wears it so well.<br/><br/>This lady here: <a href="">http://paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9019_500.jpeg</a><br/>She's got her weapon drawn, and yet looks bemused, like she's taunting someone.<br/>She's hot, but also looks like she could slice me to ribbons in a second, amidst twirling fabrics and flashing steel.<br/>She looks like she would be able to slice me to pieces without losing her composure.<br/>The low-cut shirt is pretty cleavage heavy, but in my opinion its tasteful. Her clothing is appropriate to how she kicks ass. She's owning that outfit.<br/><br/>And this scantily-clad barbarian warrior chick: <a href="">http://paizo.com/image/content/CrimsonThrone/PZO9010-Barbarian.jpg</a><br/>So, a lot more exposed skin in this one, but I'm buying it, because she's a barbarian.<br/>What's awesome is that her stomach is littered with scars, as is her face. Every patch of skin that she's showing is a testament to the fact that she's here to fight.<br/>She's ready to kill.<br/>She's a warrior. That's the first thing you know about her.<br/>And she's snarling, and sexy, and has the most amazing hair ever, and I want her to maul me.<br/><br/>There are lots of "hot chicks" in the Pathfinder line, and some are way closer to the cheesecake standard... but in my opinion, these characters look like confident, powerful, gorgeous women. I am not fantasizing about them as objects, but as people. Their stories immediately bubble up in my imagination.<br/><br/>They are all confident, and self-aware, and capable, and hot. Both physically and in their implied personalities. They're the women I'd want as lovers, or as friends, or as mothers, and definitely as people who're watching my back in a fight.<br/><br/>You can still pull all the typical "fantasy art" critiques out, and attack the fact that they're just posing and not doing, or that they're decked out in a thousand layers of armour and weapon, or that their swords are gigantic and... whatever. The point is that they are fantasy characters who manage to be women and warriors, and be genuine to both, and be amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252249/#Comment_252249" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T16:05:43+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  4:05PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.studioronin.com/main.htm" rel="nofollow">Christopher Shy's</a> work is as often sexy as it is surreal; the women he depicts look like real, every-day, flesh-and-blood women (/clone cyborgs) rather than the cartoonish big eyes, tits and ass with tiny arms, waist and feet women that rampantly appear all over gaming culture.

Some of them have a nearly Pre-raphaelite quality.<br/><br/>Geez.

You can see the determination in her body language, and in the sweat and horror of this ultimate sorcerous endeavor. She's been utterly focused on this pursuit, of immortality, so hungry to transcend the limitations of our existence that she's already moved beyond it in some ways. You can see her ribs, because the hungers of the flesh, which make you and I human, have been traded for occult obsessions.

I don't think I read roleplaying games in that way at all, so I never get to the stage where I'd decide whether some art is sexy or not. In fact, when I notice sexuality in rpg art, it's almost always because it's being blatantly plastered over the thing. This is almost without exception an inappropriate context considering the text and the purpose of the text, so I find it annoying. Thus the only "sexy" art I can even remember at this point involves all those offensive soft porn book covers that a certain sort of rpg publisher uses to catch attention in a bookstore.<br/><br/>I imagine that this'd be different if I had a more ground-up attitude at the whole notion of reading roleplaying games. Less focus on the over-all picture and more on the fluff and the fiction and on what the book has to give to me as an object of imagination, instead of an object of rules and procedures. I imagine that this has to do with general grounding in fiction, too - I rarely catch any new ideas on <i>fiction</i> from rpg books, which might be why I don't pay much attention to the specifics of illustration and other passive aesthetics in them.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, I guess my only picks for specifically sexy rpg art would all simply involve games I read and fantasized over before growing unbearably jaded - thus games like <i>AD&amp;D 2nd edition</i> and <i>Cyberpunk 2020</i> come to mind as titles that had some fetching erotic imagery in among the other stuff back at the time. In retrospect I doubt that they're special in any way compared to other games, it's just that I haven't evaluated rpg art from the personally sexy point of view through the last decade. Simple nostalgia, that.<br/><br/>Then again - what is sexy, exactly? If we'll accept a less immediately carnal definition, I suppose I could claim that <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> has a pretty sexy illustrative style. I'd use the term sympathetic myself, but the important thing is that the art attracts the eye and inspires via the use of attractive pictures of people, isn't it? From this more relaxed viewpoint I'd also mention <i>Breaking the Ice</i>, <i>Dead of Night</i>, <i>S/lay w/ Me</i>, <i>Trollbabe</i> and <i>Sweet Agatha</i> as games that have included sexy art in a way that has drawn my attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252283/#Comment_252283" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T21:56:53+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  9:56PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for reminding me to mention <b>Sweet Agatha</b>, Eero.<br/>Kevin did an awesome job making a sexy book.<br/><br/>Sweet Agatha unfolds the story of a beautiful girl, perhaps socially awkward or in with the wrong crowd, who went missing.

A lot of the "main" art for Blowback (chapter illos, the cover) is stuff I'm choosing because I'm really interested in what a game with badass clothed, sexy women and guys being sexualized and put in typically feminine positions would look like. The description above I put in to be a smartass-- I was assuming people would get offended by it, assuming the shirtless captive is a woman, and maybe not click on what is actually a picture of the badass dude getting interrogated.<br/><br/>The reasons it's hot to me: the shirtless hot guy, the well-dressed other dudes, the threat of violence. Dudes beating each other up is sexy, I don't know why, but there you go. I never understood why Brad Pitt was considered one of the sexiest people in the known universe until I saw him in Fight Club.

Some of them sure try hard enough, but it just comes across as blah.<br/><br/>I'm amazed at how many images in this thread have horror elements in their backgrounds, that sense of tension and fear complimenting the idea of sexiness, often shown as a display of power.

Primarily that fire spirit-looking guy, with the godlike physique, sensual, knowing, half-lidded eyes, and loins of flame. SO sexy. (You thought I was going to say "hot," didn't you?) The haughty woman facing down a (?)tribal woman and her child is great too, and an example of exactly how to do an "ample bosom."

That's where James West comes in to balance things out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  There's a suggestion of ethnic diversity; in these particular images nobody has an obviously nonwhite skin color but the faces definitely don't shout "generic Northern European fantasy folk."<br/><br/>So yeah... Liz Danforth.  Defined sexy looks for me for a long time.  (Downside: I don't look even a little bit like a Danforth character, so...  maybe not the best thing for self esteem.  Still.  She's awesome.)<br/><br/>Hm... never noticed this till just now, but the men in her art show a hell of a lot more skin than the women.<br/><br/>And they say it's all cheesecake in old school art!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252839/#Comment_252839" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T10:11:21+00:00" title="January 26, 2010 10:11AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice!

I'm also rather sexy-friendly, but rpg art doesn't usually do it for me. I speculated upthread about my industrial attitude to encountering rpg books, but what you say also definitely has merit: rpg art is very grim and violent (and by extension, corrupt and dirty), which is not that sexy to my mind. In fact, rpg art very much encapsulates the hoary analytical model about confounding sex and violence, nowhere else are the two so naturally intermixed as a matter of course. A part of this probably is that sometimes artists try to intentionally avoid sexiness out of enlightened gender attitudes or an effort to avoid cheesecakeness, which then ends up with an artist following obviously sexy art direction, but ending up with a very muted and mixed message in the final product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254146/#Comment_254146" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T19:13:01+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  7:13PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>That's not a bad point, Jake.

(I'll take this opportunity for a shameless plug.) In my game While The World Ends all you have to do to "win" is to succeed with three dice-rolls. However, each character also has a Fear, something that is risked in the pursuit for the Goal.  Fail three dice-rolls, and your Fears come true.  The Fears could be anything. Fear getting stuck in the monotone suburban life? Fear being killed in the street? Fear not finding your lost sister again? Everything can be done in game. And simple threat of violence doesn't bring Awesome to the table anymore for me. Just having a PC eaten by the monster in the dungeon is not good enough, but what are the consequences and implications of the PC being eaten?  In the answer lies the cool story.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Also, to be slightly on topic as well.

Ridiculously overblown sexuality  was always part of what Exalted was about. Or at least it was when the game launched. Did that change at some point? Anyway, it's well drawn and well presented, and a fair representation of the kind of character you might find in the game. Yes, it's stupidly sexual, but that's the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254232/#Comment_254232" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T08:27:51+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  8:27AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2010 8:28AM by renatoram.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess people objected to the cameltoe as a centerpiece of the composition.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's <i>stupidly</i> sexual, as you said, and I think that would be a factor in being ashamed to be seen reading it in the metro (if I had it).<br/>\n(it's also not particularly <i>sexy</i> to me specifically, what with the deformed anatomy and half-football boobs, but I can see the point)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254234/#Comment_254234" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T08:48:32+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  8:48AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.
