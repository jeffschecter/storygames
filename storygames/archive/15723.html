I'd like the actual play to still resemble d&amp;d, not necessarily in ruleset, but rather in style: players have a goal, control one PC and seek to accomplish that goal in a play session.  However, I would like to have a "meta-game" on top of this game where the players are rewarded for control of certain areas.  I see an important part of this game being a map of the city, showing what areas are under their control and what areas are under rival factions control.  <br/><br/>Some of my inspirations for this include: <br/><br/>Batman: No Man's Land - Batman fights to regain Gotham after an earthquake causes  the US government to give up on Gotham.<br/>Paizo's Kingmaker - Players are slowly building up a feudal territory, and get bonuses for how they build up their city.<br/>Escape from New York - A ruined city with a power vacuum, cut off from the outside. <br/><br/>Right now, I'm not too concerned about the time period.  I could see this set in the stone age to the transhuman age, as its the tale of a group of people taking power and control of those around them, but I do have have to ask you, oh story gamers, two questions:<br/><br/>What rulesets do you think would work well for this sort of gaming?  I already see Apocalypse World being great for this, but would love some other suggestions.<br/>Let's assume that my players will only play some form of D&amp;D.  How would you adapt/add to the ruleset of D&amp;D to play this kind of game?  Is the Kingmaker rules robust enough to work for a long term campaign?  <br/><br/>Thanks everyone!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356536/#Comment_356536" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T08:08:40+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  8:08AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about John Wick's Blood &amp; Honor?  You could use it's domain system (expandable, upgradable) for the PCs turf.  Instead of the honor (sort of a shared dice pool that you all want to protect but any can use up), call it 'respect'.  Instead of a katana (largely one-shot kills), make it a handgun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Kauko" title="Matt Kauko"><img alt="Matt Kauko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Kauko">Matt Kauko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356648/#Comment_356648" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T19:12:37+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  7:12PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Marshall, I haven't had a chance to check that one out yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356727/#Comment_356727" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T09:46:12+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  9:46AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, Levi Kornelsen's game <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amagigames/the-cog-wars" rel="nofollow">The Cog Wars</a> might be helpful here.  It's about battling for control of a city partially controlled by evil masterminds, and it has a very interesting tool set.  In particular, the home base and mission generators could be of use no matter what system you use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
