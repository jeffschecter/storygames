Label controversy<br/><br/>2. Universalism, system neutral, \u201cthey don\u2019t need books\u201d, anti-structure.  <br/><br/>The first is simple. If not many people agree or understand what is meant by \u201ctraditional rpg\u201d then the label will not be easily used, the same goes for labels like \u201cstory games\u201d. <br/><br/>In board games we have some helpful categories, there are plenty of games that blur the lines but still having these words helps people, these are things like \u201ceuro game\u201d \u201cameritrash\u201d \u201cabstract strategy\u201d  \u201cdexterity\u201d \u201cparty\u201d. Each category of game serves very different masters and appeals to a unique psychology.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what over arching labels could be applied to role playing games, clearly there are some great unique tastes out there but I don\u2019t have knowledge to divine them nor a command of language to label them. To me RPG and story game are not quite working, I see a big difference in a game like Ocean compared to Apocalypse world.<br/><br/>As for the second problem, \u201cuniversalism, system neutral, \u201cthey don\u2019t need books\u201d, anti-structure\u201d. I think it's important to focus on how many RPG's largely do not qualify as games, most are not \u201ccomplete systems\u201d meaning they do not have rules that take you from start to finish. <br/><br/>Incomplete objects are hard to categorize and understand, you can not put AGE, PLAYERS, and TIME on the back of a dnd book because all dnd will give you is advice on how long a sessions should last, how many players are maybe a good idea.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306115/#Comment_306115" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T08:30:10+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  8:30AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you can take it too far, at least with the "incompleteness" of RPGs. One of the defining features of RPGs is the potentially infinite number of inputs at any given moment. You can follow absolutely all of the directions in Primetime Adventures and still have a problem if one person is doing a comedy and everyone else is doing a drama, or if one person is doing a pun-and-fourth-wall-breaking comedy and everyone else is doing a character-driven sitcom.  The amount of customization of play experience that each player is capable of in every moment of play is stupendous. What "generic" games try to do is shift much of that customization to the preparation phase of play. (GURPS character creation is gigantic for a reason.)  But the same amount of customization takes place in every RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306116/#Comment_306116" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T08:58:18+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  8:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it would be fair to place "universalism"  as a quality an rpg could have, a "taste" perhaps a little like tofu. <br/><br/>I want to see more games i can pick to match an event or situation. i have a collection of board games, this does a fairly good job of entertaining the wide verity of groups that may visit. some groups really like euro games, others war games, others still need something else. based on the qualities each unique game has i can chose one that will entertin my guests.  <br/><br/>I think character creation is very interesting. it's highly structured, players accept this fairly well. however plot creation and story direction tends to be very unstructured, why should these things be any diffident?<br/><br/>also character creation is usually one of the few "complete systems" in a game, however it still allows for plenty of player input. this is really no different then building a deck in a TCG or an army list for a miniatures game.<br/><br/>There is no reason for rpg's to require incomplete systems. the more incomplete an rpg is the fewer qualities it has to appeal to any group of players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306117/#Comment_306117" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T09:05:31+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  9:05AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't agree.

I've played in games where the experience was a lot like playing the Sim City, which is a toy.  I'm not sure I'd categorize all games this way.  Burning Empires is most definitely a game.  There are defined goals for the players and there are winners and losers and everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306143/#Comment_306143" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T12:14:41+00:00" title="December 28, 2010 12:14PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we're thinking that way, I'd say instruction manuals for something you might do anyway. One of the things I always come back to is the first RPG I ever played was Fantasy Quest - it was woefully incomplete, and pretty much consisted of a character sheet that resembled the FF1 status screen. We didn't have any rules beyond "roll d6, 1-3 is a success, 4-6 is a failure, pass die to opponent" - nothing else mattered, it was just fluff. AD&amp;D was similar, I'm finding after about a decade of not playing regularly that there are a bunch of rules that I just didn't know about, yet without knowing them I still played it fine.<br/><br/>If you play a board game without rules it's probably not going to work, same with a card game - it'll probably generate into 52 card pickup. With an RPG, you can play it, because as a lot of RPGs mention in the "What is a roleplaying game" section, we all played it as kids.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306150/#Comment_306150" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T13:45:33+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  1:45PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Can we make such labels universal and useful?

I don't see any reason to doubt them.  And given that, I think you could indeed make those labels useful.<br/><br/>But can you make them universal?  I'm honestly less sure about that one; I definitely don't think you can get there from the usual internet forum "top-down" approach, where some dude splits every game under the sun into two very very very broad categories (which curiously always seems to be some not-very-well-hidden variation on "the cool things I like" versus "the stupid things other people like").  And once that's happened, the usual heated arguments break out as people dispute which side of that imaginary line most games belong on, because (surprise surprise) hardly anyone can agree on such enormous and ill-defined categories.<br/><br/>But I think maybe you can build <i>up</i> to being universal, by making very small, limited, highly-focused categories wherever it's easy to do so, and getting <i>those</i> established and accepted near-universally.  You know, making little islands of games that most people generally accept "belong together," floating in the big gray sea of every other game on the planet.  Then once you've got that dry land to stand on, it might be easier to divvy up the less-easily-classified games, since you'll be able to make better analogies and explain your opinions better (as in "this game is a lot like a Foobar game, but the way it handles GM authority is more like a Bargle game").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306158/#Comment_306158" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T15:21:51+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  3:21PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>"this game is a lot like a Foobar game, but the way it handles GM authority is more like a Bargle game"</blockquote>\nI'm just going to say that yeah, that's the way I want to be able to talk about games. I don't see it as some sort of end-all super-tool, but it would help <i>a lot</i>.<br/><br/>Because right now comparing two games online feels like asking for trouble, even when I love them both. It seems like it almost inevitably leads to people seeing it as this "crap I like vs crap you like and I hate" antagonism, which is rubbish and not productive at all. It's almost as if different things weren't allowed to be awesome simultaneously. As soon as you say "Game X is more Skub, but game Y is more Busk." (even if it's a neutral observation) you're likely to get a "Why do you hate game X?"-type defensive response.<br/><br/>Note: I'm writing this from a very personal experience/viewpoint. It's something that bugs me a lot when it happens, which is  why I'm magnifying the problem. I'm overly sensitive to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_306161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306161/#Comment_306161" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T15:57:51+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  3:57PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>Incomplete objects are hard to categorize and understand, you can not put AGE, PLAYERS, and TIME on the back of a dnd book because all dnd will give you is advice on how long a sessions should last, how many players are maybe a good idea.</blockquote>You may as well say that DnD is suited for 4-6 players, age 14+, and plays well for 4 hours.

Do it!<br/><br/>If you succeed, you may create a taxonomy, a tool that all designers of role-playing games will have available when labeling and selling their games. That may do some good.<br/><br/>And if you do not succeed, you may still do some good; trying to do it will have you investigate role-playing games in a new manner, and that will help you (and possibly us) understand it better. That may be beneficial too!<br/><br/>However; you may consider that the field outside DnD is too narrow to support a taxonomy; the terms necessary need the support of a public discourse with origin in a sufficiently active rpg-commerce.

Rpgs as they are today are the smallest niche in one of the smallest entertainment categories. this is depressing because i think the capacity we have to role play is very interesting and in some ways vital to becoming better more developed people. Role play forces us out of ourselves and perhaps makes us more prepared and empathetic.<br/><br/>A lack of vocabulary makes collaboration difficult, it also makes it much harder to understand what has been done and how you can do something new. Essentially words are ideas, without the words, holding the idea in you head is difficult.<br/><br/>Ideas like number of players, age, and play time, are critical concepts when developing a board game. many choices are made based on how a particular game fits into those statistics. <br/><br/>"incompleteness" is holding the vocabulary back (by making things hard to define) but it is also a reason why rpgs fail so often, it's what makes being a DM so draining, it's why friendships end. " If they they are not playing right, get them out of your group" is a common thought among rpg players, it's very rare to hear board gamers talk SO often about problem players, even then their solution is to often get another game, "oh this game allows for king making lets not play that with random john." Only in very extreme cases will board gamers consider the player at fault.<br/><br/>I have listened to podcast after podcast discussing "problem players" when in many cases those problems are with the games themselves. The games encourage poor play, sure even the most determined A-hole could suck the fun out of LCR a game where you make no choices , but thats not what i'm talking about. rpgs often dig deep ditches that even well meaning players can fall into and with no vocabulary to help us understand what games will work with particular players we simply learn the hard way.<br/><br/>rpgs deserve to be as successful and wide spread as boardgames.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306251/#Comment_306251" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T12:25:05+00:00" title="December 29, 2010 12:25PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tyler brings up some interesting points.<br/><br/>One that I think relates to some of those is that what makes RPGs, especially ones geared towards the traditional long term play, really great as a hobby, may also make them really bad as games.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure how to explain this exactly, but it seems like so much of what is put out as RPGs/SGs is immediately geared to the hobby, rather than being games.<br/><br/>Just as an example, to me Lady Blackbird is a game. All of the system discussion stuff and character change stuff and even hints at how to re-use and hack the system... that stuff is geared to the hobby.

D&amp;D and Primetime Adventures are both RPGs, but I think it reasonable to say that they're about as different from each other as, say, Super Mario Bros. and Half-Life. Of course, given the way tabletop gamers have reacted to attempts to generate vocabulary in the past (and the confusion still surrounding most terms that have been devised organically), from there I've basically thrown up my hands and given up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306267/#Comment_306267" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T15:30:36+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  3:30PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the issue is that there's far more edge-blurring in RPGs than there is in video games, or maybe fewer in the "center" of the classifications I can think of. It makes it hard to identify clear divisions. In addition, depending on the collection of supplements you add to any given game, you can often easily push it from one type of game to another, at least in terms of content and often in terms of systems.

We also see some interesting risks with component rpgs like warhammer 3rd ed and the DnD essentials line, and even a few notable indie games going with the box set.<br/><br/>One problem I can see coming is when a large risk is taken but fails. the cost of a component RPG demands a radically different content structure from an RPG book, FFG has been trying different structures but I doubt they are going to find the right one, in fact they are kind of heading in the wrong direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306291/#Comment_306291" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T19:55:31+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  7:55PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Let's try to list some things that we think are objective ways RPGs can be categorized.

Settlers of catan ends at 10 points precisely because PEOPLE STILL WANT TO PLAY AT THAT POINT. ever notice how many games end right as they get really interesting? Thats because after that point they are done, they have nothing else. To be played more then once games need to leave people wanting more.<br/><br/>The 4 hour play time people think rpgs have is a function of having no rules to end a session and too many players at one table. parents ration candy for a reason, the feeling i have after a long rpg session is a cousin to that too much candy feeling.<br/><br/>But rpgs are so freaking great (in bed) that we keep coming back despite the abuse. we will sacrifice relationships with people who cant stand us anymore because we just cant give up the game.

How else can we be the change we want to see?</blockquote>\nSpecifically address some major problems pretty much all RPGs have.<br/><br/>If I'm getting 3 or 4 people together for a board game, and none of us have read the rules it's already pretty damn tedious. I know some people who refuse to play a new game if not even one person already knows the rules. The thing is with a board game, if one person buys the game, reads the rules and then introduces it to everyone else, things proceed quite quickly. <br/><br/>RPGs hardly have that. The only game I can think of that would actually work like that is Aces &amp; Eights. I grabbed Showdown, haven't played it with anyone yet, but the entire rules are set around gun fights, and they even have a few scenarios with defined start and end conditions (what Tyler was just talking about). Now my understanding about Aces &amp; Eights is that it has a bunch of components that don't really need to be known to play, so you could go from Showdown to full A&amp;E and just read the additional rules of what you want to add on.<br/><br/>So let's think about how we could get a game that at its core is simple enough that you could get someone to read through the rules for 30 minutes solo, introduce the game to 2-3 friends and have everyone up and running with the game playing over another 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The reason I bring up start time is even if the game idea is really appealing to someone, I find they often balk at actually learning the rules. Then, if the rules have any complexity to them that require learning it becomes almost impossible to play. As well as I know ORE, playing it with 5-6 other people who don't actually know the rules becomes pretty frustrating - what's cool about the system is all the stuff you can do from the base mechanics, but it requires you to understand those base mechanics really well. That means that everyone has read the rules thoroughly, and I've found few people with the patience to learn a game to that degree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306306/#Comment_306306" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T00:05:48+00:00" title="December 30, 2010 12:05AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Let's try to list some things that we think are objective ways RPGs can be categorized.

I'd say optimal group size is something you probably won't see by comparing pairs of games, but it's also something that's pretty crucial to determining is a game for you. There are of course general rules to go by, I'd have a hunch that for most games the optimal size is 1 GM and 2-5 players, putting it at 3-6, but some games, like Tunnels &amp; Trolls and Traveller are suited for solo play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306329/#Comment_306329" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T06:48:25+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  6:48AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>"role playing games have a yet unrealized potential"</blockquote>\nNo shit. That's why we're all here. Isn't this the default assumption of the recent indie games movement of the past decade?<br/><br/>On the accessibility and "clear beginnings and endings" issues, you're preaching to the choir or, really, the vanguard. My Life with Master and Dust Devils and Mountain Witch changed roleplaying by making it "normal" to write a game only meant to last a few sessions. Geiger Counter and Fiasco and Happy Birthday Robot have demonstrated that single-session games are also completely viable. Mouse Guard and Apocalypse World have shown that you can create strict, explicit rules for "traditional" multi-session GMing, removing the mystery and improving accessibility. Recent shortform games like Lady Blackbird have pushed at accessibility from other directions, making it easy to pick up and play something.<br/><br/>Really, this community has been at the forefront of most of the things you describe for a long time, and will hopefully continue to be. That's definitely one of the reasons we've been relatively successful and gotten a lot of attention. So I guess I don't see the same issues that you do, because we are clearly doing better than most other groups of game designers in making games that are accessible and easy to pick up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306351/#Comment_306351" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T07:57:44+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  7:57AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And this community has my honor and respect, I was addressing the few people who weren't on board or at least were still asking for reasons why games should be complete.<br/><br/>As for what this community can do, the only thing I want to see different is a movement away from books. I think the few box sets coming out are great but so long as they have large rulebooks attached they are not addressing the real problem. Rpgs thrived when the only way to learn was from books, today the skill to learn from diagnostic manuals is basically dead. The only way rules can effect a player's thought process is if they know them, putting all your rules into a book is the worst way to educate a table of people.

Because it doesn't jive with me.<br/>\n  What I mean is, one of the great things about RPGs is, there are no winners or losers. In that way, I am not sure it qualifies as a game. I mean, a good campaign can go on for some time. And a good session lenght is decided by people's schedules not the game we are playing.<br/>\n  There are some games that are not suited for this play style, so, there is no consistency.<br/>\n  But I don't think adding that consistency adds anything to the hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Like, the fact that Heroquest doesn't tell you how to setup a session or when a session is over doesn't diminish the quality of that game.<br/>\n  Also, some people take a session to mean different things, there are some groups that won't bother unless they can do 8 hours or more and there are other groups that won't play more than two hours.<br/>\n  Maybe that is what you are pointing at, how to get the two hour game in front of the two hour people? Even so, couldn't you just play 4 2-hour session in some kind of marathon 8 hour session for the long-play folks?<br/>\n  I guess that is the rub, because the fundamental play of RPGs is so malleable, I am not sure any such classification would be meaningful.<br/>\n  In the end, its a good idea, if we can somehow ensure that the standards don't become constraints.<br/>\n<br/>\n  3:16 is a good example of what I am talking about. you can play a single session in 2-3 hours (can even squeeze it into an hour with a shoehorn). But, the real fun of it doesn't show up until you do a multi-session campaign. Some of the features of the game take a few planets to build up to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don't know, maybe you are on to something, I just am not sure if that is what is holding back RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do agree with you on the whole "Identity politics issue" it drives me nuts. And I have done my best not to engage in it or feed that troll. But it is a minefield on the internet and is still a contentious issue IRL (there is a great player I know IRL that pretty much won't play with me because I said the words D&amp;D, it's sad really, because they were fun to play with until I made that mistake).<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306422/#Comment_306422" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T16:27:41+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  4:27PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The general impression I get is there are more people who would like to play RPGs than who actually do play RPGs.

I have this exact problem right now. Two of our regular core players (who are in a few groups) have gone overseas for a month, and the remaining players from the now incomplete groups have come together and are looking for games to play during january. Trying to work out what game to play is really really challenging. If there were some easy way of seeing what the different games expected: general session length, character creation complexity, npc generation, session prep time, etc etc. <br/><br/>All that takes, right now, a lot of research and time, which is making some people just feel like not gaming for the month. Which leads to he problem of not enough players for a decent game. If there was a nice list of features that was common across game systems ten this wouldn't be a problem. <br/><br/>So like o said, I look forward to seeing the results of this thread                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306539/#Comment_306539" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-01T13:35:56+00:00" title="January  1, 2011  1:35PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HeroQuest would be my default go to system for such a situation.

Indeed, board games aren't that much more successful a niche than RPGs.  Video games, by contrast, tend to be more open-ended like RPGs.  You can keep playing for an indeterminate amount of time, save your status, and pick up the game later.  <br/><br/>That said, I'm intrigued by having more RPGs with more directly timed play.  A few games spring to mind for me: Puppetland is explicitly timed at one hour, and The Shab-al-Hiri Roach and A Thousand and One Nights have turn structures that give them a loose playing time session.  Some of the scenario-based games like Lady Blackbird or Parlor LARPs also have finite times, though they are looser.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306640/#Comment_306640" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T05:58:02+00:00" title="January  3, 2011  5:58AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            video games are actually a perfect example.<br/><br/>Some video games are highly structured into levels and maybe worlds, regardless they have discreet play/reward cycles. There are more open wold games but even still these are structured into quests or some other form of short term and long term goals. <br/><br/>So I think it's just as viable for an open world game to include structured quests, these would create a fairly natural timing structure.<br/><br/>As for board games and rpgs being about as popular, i was mostly thinking about the larger game &amp; toy industry, there are very few mass market rpgs, where as there are plenty mass market, board, miniatures, card games. This is maybe not important to some people here but i think it would be really great to get the masses roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_306642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306642/#Comment_306642" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T06:14:43+00:00" title="January  3, 2011  6:14AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going on from the list posted by Deliverator:<br/><br/>* Genre: Historical - Contemporary - Future - Fantasy - Comedy<br/><br/>* Basic motor: Game - Game-master - Players<br/><br/>* Age: 10 - 15 - Adult<br/><br/>* Time: 15 min - 1 hour - 2 hours - 4 hours (a parenthesis may state that <i>campaign play is possible</i>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306650/#Comment_306650" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T08:59:43+00:00" title="January  3, 2011  8:59AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2011 9:06AM by TylerT.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that list Tomas<br/><br/>as far a basic motor, i think that is a good name but i'm not sure how many people will understand it. however i'm having trouble coming up with something else.<br/><br/>maybe this?<br/><br/>driven by : system - game master - players<br/><br/>also maybe add these to genre<br/>* Genre: Historical - Contemporary - Future - Fantasy - Comedy - Drama - Horror<br/><br/>I would be happy to create a series of generic icons for each of these entries if people were actually interested in placing them on their books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_306663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306663/#Comment_306663" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T11:33:01+00:00" title="January  3, 2011 11:33AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2011 11:39AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see that "basis motor" as the best term either ... but "driven by" is even worse.
