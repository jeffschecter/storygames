In LARP this is constantly explored in all sort of ways. But in tabletop roleplaying games the physical reality seems to be left out of the equation. People have stressed how important all sort of things are to the social contract, yet, the physical side of things seem strangely left out of it.<br/><br/>Does seating matter? Sitting? Does the physical space matter?<br/><br/>But in my expedience it do matter. For example who is sitting next to who, and who can easily hold eye contact with who will really affect which characters in the group that will interact with each other. Love stories seems to me especially prone to be affected by how people are seated.<br/><br/>Something that makes it painfully obvious that seating matters is when people take turns setting scene, but the order of when they get to set scenes are decided by the seating. People set different types of scene, and the order in which different individuals is seated often creates a flow of different kinds of scenes, and if the players have a character each, it also affect who can respond to whos actions, etc.<br/><br/>Does the seating arrangement communicate something about status? Is there a high-status GM chair where the one in charge sit? Is there some low status position in the gaming room? <br/><br/>Seating is serious stuff.<br/><br/>So is sitting. You body posture affect you emotions, and player emotion both affect the game an bleed into the game. So whenever you sitting straight backed on uncomfortable chairs, or half lying in a sofa will affect the feel of the game. (My gaming groups have had a \u201dno sofas\u201d rules at time because people became to relaxed even sleepy, and it produced a slow an sluggish game at times.)<br/><br/>How you sit will also affect on how you can play you character. Can you move? To what degree? Can you stand up? Can you gesture? Can you leave you place at the table and walk around? How close are you physically to thhe other players? Can you touch them? Is touching a part of the social contract?<br/><br/>(And then there whole other bunch of about the physical reality of gaming that not about sitting or seating that affects the game, lighting, how the room the game take place is in socially coded, etc etc. but I'll leave it to some other discussion.)<br/><b><br/>What you experience of how seating and sitting arrangement to affect your games? Can this be more used in game design to create better games? Different games?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388611/#Comment_388611" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T13:54:10+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  1:54PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AGH, this is the nub of the thing that is most obviously wrong with my current group: they simply refuse to sit at a table.

There was no place to sit down.<br/><br/>We where playing in small one room apartment. We where four players. There was no place we could sit down all four of us. Either we could all sit/lie in a cuddly pile on the bed, and that work great for cuddly scenes, but is soon got way too warm. Or two persons could sit on the couch, and two persons could sit squeezed in on the floor on a kind of an awkward place. Then there was a computer chair at the small worktable, but you couldn't move that chair anywhere else in the room. So you could sit n the chair, at a distance to everyone else at an awkward angle to every one else.<br/><br/>Since there was no sitting arrangement that worked we got creative and move around. We stood up. We loomed behind the sofa looking down on who was sitting there. We held monologues in the lone chair. We sprawled on the bed. We strangled each other on the floor. We lurked in the doorway. We stormed out into the tiny kitchen alcove. We his behind the sofa. We stood by the window, looking out at a distance.<br/><br/>It was great, intense, playful and creative. In some ways it was the best tabletop playing space ever.

The way one of them sat put them directly to my right, with a gap chair between them and the rest of the players. Over the course of the game, this guy's Brainer was ostracized, threatened, bossed around, stuffed in a claw machine, and ended up taking over the settlement at the end.  People were friendly and collaborative OOC, to be clear, but in-game that one chair's worth of space marked him as being a bit outside the group, which totally fueled play.<br/><br/>Now, if he had been less confident, or the other players hadn't made a point of being nice in out-of-character discussion, I could see him walking away unhappy or hurt. Subtle set-up can count for a lot. When I ran an AW session later, I made sure everyone was sitting next to one another, and shoved the spare chair off to the side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388622/#Comment_388622" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T14:54:14+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  2:54PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If my current group sits at a table, we're focused and the game proceeds.

I've gotten more and more sensitive to stuff like this the last few years, and not only in gaming but in making music (especially singing parts a capella), and most social interactions.<br/><br/>Some of my typical concerns in gaming:<br/>\u2022 If I run a GM-less game, it's important to me not to sit in "the GM chair" (head of the table or otherwise isolated) but that the group's positioned equally.<br/>\u2022 When I'm a player, I try not to sit next to the GM if there is one. I always get a fair share of the spotlight where ever I sit, so I leave the places with the best possibilities for connecting/communicating with the GM to others.<br/>\u2022 If I know I'm going to play something where I interact intensely with another player (for instance if we've got a romantic relationship in game) I'll want to sit near that person. In most groups I've played touching is accepted/expected (usually this'll mean touching hands, arms or shoulders).<br/><br/>The most recent thing about seating in my mind is from this spring when I played a few sessions with people I haven't known or played with for very long. Sometimes when we were seating ourselves it sort of drifted towards being a boys' side and a girls' side. That felt very odd to me, so I asked if we could rearrange the seating. No one seemed to mind, and my experience was that we got a better connection as a group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388631/#Comment_388631" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T15:23:12+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  3:23PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a pet peeve against not sitting around a table as well, for the same exact reasons Jason mentioned.

Put them at the table, and they're still engaged in the game, but they're uncomfortable and start getting snarkier and more irritable, and in-character interactions get stifled by that.<br/><br/>The other half gets out into the living room, and suddenly they're dozing off or getting distracted by side conversations or work or their goddamn phones, not paying attention to the other players, etc...but put them at the table where they don't have the room (or the comfort) to do any of those things, and they're back in the game.<br/><br/>It sucks.

When we had someone skyping in, the laptop with the skype (later google hangout) window was at one end of the table. Later, as summer heat set in, I swapped seats with one of the players because she didn't want to be frozen to an icicle, and I did. We were both happier with me right next to the air conditioning. Josh wants to be near enough the power to recharge phone and look up his character sheet online. (The game's got a wiki, and Josh is disgraphic. I have my laptop open to the wiki as well.)<br/><br/>Gaming at my place varies. We used to use a big card table, then shifted to lots of small folding wooden tables in something resembling a circle or obloid. I sometimes shifted to the floor, especially when running Beyond the Mountains of Madness. I'm not quite sure why I'm often comfortable on the floor, but I am.<br/><br/>When I ran Tatters of the King, though, I was in a chair, with my laptop. I had the hard copy book open. I had the e-book open. I had several windows open on my laptop -- portraits of NPCs, visual aids of various locations, and so on. The small tables meant the laptop could be on one, and my dinner on another.

I also stated that to reflect this, there would only be half as many chairs as players and that if anyone wanted to sit down, they would have to find an in-character way of taking a chair away from one of the seated players. The pre-gens each had a small mechanical incentive for both sitting and standing, e.g. they got a bonus to their roll to achieve certain goals depending on their position.<br/><br/>Sometime after running this game, I mentioned it as part of a thread on another forum, which created quite an unexpected reaction: some people very testily responded that if they'd have been in a game like that, they'd have told the GM off and then walked out! I guess some people are just very attached to the idea of sitting down while they roleplay and, I have to stress, the game I ran was extremely successful: the players got so immersed in their characters and their situation that I could have quite easily wandered off to the bar to get a drink, assured that they would have carried on without me.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388660/#Comment_388660" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T00:05:50+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 12:05AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random thoughts on game seating:<br/>* I once had an idea for a status-based seating design, where characters with high status would sit nearer the GM, and others would sit farther away so they'd be more easily ignored.<br/>* In "Acid moss", players sit on the floor at a distance, and each time the alarm goes (once a minute), they move closer until they're in a big heap.<br/>* When we play at my house, we sit in the library (fancy word for the room with the books). This is a sheltered space, a little cave of plants and subtle lighting and books and a good (but not sleep-inducing) sofa. Harder to hear the kids, and as GM I make sure not to sit at the entrance where the kids will come to interrupt us... <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>* Games like Polaris and LiToS define some player/character interrelations by seating. "The player to your right is your Heart", or something like that. Choosing who sits where can have a large impact on the game; letting it be random makes for higher replay value ("yeah, we're the same characters, but now I'm controlling the Princess' gift, not the Knight's lycanthropy!")<br/>* There is a GM chair when we play, in that the GM usually gets to pick where they want to sit. It's not a formal thing, but sometimes it is explicit ("Hey, Steinar is GMing, maybe he should sit there...?

Normally, the only thing I've ever insisted upon as a GM is that I get one of the chair that makes it easier to prevent my laptop from sliding off my lap. The groups I run or play in tend to use one of three spaces: lounging around a variety of seats in my living room, lounging around a variety of seats in my friend's living room, or sitting at my other friend's Emissary table. The Emissary is certainly superior for games that involve complex maps and miniatures, but thinking back, I can't see any player interactions as strongly influenced by our seating style so much as other external factors (like proper air circulation or availability of snacks). I wonder if my players would agree, though.

I recall a robotech campaign a long time ago, in the living room of my friends house. He had those couches that are quite low but yet comfortable, the kind that you fall on them instead of sitting. Anyway, their characters were captured by the zentraedi and they were being interrogated by the ship commander. I was GMing and stood for that part, and suddenly gave a twist on the scene, where their answers helped the commander uncover a plot against their crew by a merc in that same room, which got smashed instead of the PCs. Later the players told me they thought they were actually doomed, so standing up and having the players unable to stand up so quickly also had a good impact on the scene we were playing.<br/><br/>Another thing I found important right now is what is in the table. Nowadays we end up with our supply of snacks in the middle of the table while playing Pathfinder. So using miniatures for combat kinda becomes less important, since nobody wants to interrupt the flow of the story by taking time to clean the table and set up the mat... or perhaps it's just that nobody wants to clean up, heh...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388746/#Comment_388746" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T15:28:47+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  3:28PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If I'm running a game, I prefer to be at the head of the table because I tend to interact less with people who are directly flanking me.

I can see how seating option 2 on the page Andy posted could make a dramatic difference, but not being able to have face-to-face interaction with both of the people on either side of me would just feel awful. Every time I address the player to my left, I'm turning my back on the player to my right, and vice versa. That...sucks. Or at least it really seems like it would suck? Maybe it works better on a round table than a rectangular one?<br/><br/><br/>When I'm playing, I stand up and move around the room a lot if the seating arrangement allows it (and if it doesn't, <i>I fucking hate that seating arrangement</i>). I'm basically the only person in my gaming group who does this, though, and I never really considered what effect that has when I'm looming over them or crouching down to talk with them or leaning against a wall in their peripheral vision or whatever. Hm. Interesting stuff.<br/><br/>Conversely, I don't get to stand up and move around nearly as much when GMing, because I want to have my notes close at hand and to be able to see/be seen by all the players all the time, so that if someone wants my attention, they can get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388942/#Comment_388942" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T11:30:25+00:00" title="August 31, 2012 11:30AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a GM, I usually stand up while "performing".

My character was a very loud soldier type guy, and for the most part I was up, yelling and distrusting others. Yet there were moments when I wanted to go unnoticed. So I sat down and remained still and with a low voice.<br/><br/>At the end of the session, I was the only one whose character had not been killed at least once.<br/><br/>The moment the other players realized that, their "WTF" faces were priceless. They surely remembered me being all loud and expressive. How come I had managed to stay away from "real" danger during the game?<br/><br/>It was a very interesting experience for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389664/#Comment_389664" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T23:22:54+00:00" title="September  8, 2012 11:22PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sometime after running this game, I mentioned it as part of a thread on another forum, which created quite an unexpected reaction: some people very testily responded that if they'd have been in a game like that, they'd have told the GM off and then walked out!
