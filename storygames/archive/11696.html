Likewise, just because you might be conflict-oriented I should not assume your characters are -- and so forth.

For example, there is no official GM type person in Capes, and in many games (i.e. MSG) the position rotates between the available players. It rather goes without saying that you need someone who understands the rules, but that would be true of ANY game regardless of its type or genre. You can't play Contract Bridge if nobody knows how. On the whole though I think this does say a lot about group dynamics, in that even when a game has no official GM written into its rules, it is common for one person within the game to rise to a position where they are practically acting as a GM. This may be due to pack dominance and peer pressures, or it may be due to preconceived expectations on the part of the traditionalist role-players that make up much of the target audience.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260879/#Comment_260879" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T06:22:51+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  6:22AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since "indie", as far as I know, only describes commercial arrangement and not any concept in the game itself, there is no real difference between any of those terms except in how they reach the public.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260889/#Comment_260889" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T06:51:41+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  6:51AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I think the readers of this thread will all have different ideas of which games are "indie" and which are "traditional", etc, but since we're just talking about the similarities between those games, is there any need to argue about what those categories are, and how to define them?

The term Indie has been used for years in the music industry before it came to the RPG industry, and has always defied official definition. I still like the original meaning of the term from way back, which can approximately be rendered as 'owned by its creator.' Furthermore many Indie games go through the 3-tier system. There's even a fulfilment / distribution company called Indie Press Revolution.

Though rare, there are RPGs designed to be single player (I must admit that the only one I can think of right now is J. Morningstar's (I think) the Plant, but I'm sure there are others.) Similarly, I've seen quite a few RPGs with absolute set-in-stone win conditions too. I think Piledrivers and Powerbombs may have 'em, Ganakagok certainly does as does Roanoke, and there may be others.<br/><br/>I do like the idea of breaking ice and building friendships, though again this may be more a function of group dynamics than an intrinsic part of the hobby and there may well be cases where an RPG would actually get in the way of this, if some of the group were seriously anti.<br/><br/>But then I think that pretty much anything we say beyond the very basic core of the hobby will have its exceptions.

But to add something new to the thread, most RPGs that I have ever read (with no notable exceptions that I can think of) concentrate on powerful, dramatic events. Usually this boils down to some kind of fighting, an investigation or mystery of some kind, or a clash of personalities a 'la soap operas. I don't know of any RPGs that deliberately go out of their way to model everyday, mundane occurrences. Such things are usually hand-waved past without a second glance.<br/><br/>An obvious thing maybe, but it is something that I beleive is near-universal.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261113/#Comment_261113" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T02:57:13+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  2:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Sorry, I meant "creator owned", which again, has nothing to do with the content.

But it does influence it!<br/><br/>Game content in larger companies are often driven by pure economic reasons. They have business needs, overhead, employees\u2026 generally more on the line.<br/><br/>This creates restrictions. A lot of my friends who have worked at or for Wizards of the Coast and Paizo want to work on scifi games. But fantasy sells. An equivalent scifi game might sell only 20% of what their fantasy games sell for. And if they want to take risks, that might mean delving into horror, maybe superheroes. <br/><br/>Restrictions are not limited to theme. But everything. Your game supports a certain number of players. Focuses mainly on combat. Is built to be incomplete or expanded on to pave the way for more product. <br/><br/>Even your art direction is limited by these restrictions. You know a cover featuring a female elf or dragon like creator or something with large horns, depicting violence or the potential for violence is going to sell more. <br/><br/>Plus if you want to sell in retail stores you want to publish a big book (even if the game suffers due to the size) because you can sell it at a certain price point and you have a thicker spine that stands out when facing out on book shelves. Or you go for the box set so that you have better store presence in non-gaming bookstores or are next to the boardgames. <br/><br/>Creator owned does not define your game\u2019s content. But it means way less restrictions. You have less on the line. You don\u2019t answer to anyone. You can do anything you want. Even if no one in the world will care about it. Even if it is doomed to sell poorly. It doesn\u2019t matter. <br/><br/>Now creator owned games can be modeled after larger businesses (and large businesses sometimes take surprisingly huge risks or publish secondary content in addition to their main lines as experiments). And they can make the same exact games for the same reasons and have similar goals. But they don\u2019t have to. At least not to be successful. Your success does not have to equal money.<br/><br/>And although creator owned does not equal games about super niche subjects or games with no combat, creator owned makes it much, much more likely (although this depends on what\u2019s popular, you could define traditional content as \u201csells well\u201d and indie content as \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter how well it sells\u201d). Which is why I feel \u201ccreator owned\u201d and certain styles of games are often linked even though the definition of indie is not content specific.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261171/#Comment_261171" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T08:59:28+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  8:59AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Similarities are\u2026<br/><br/>&gt; it\u2019s social (people play together)<br/><br/>&gt; it\u2019s a conversation (listening and communicating is key)<br/><br/>&gt; it\u2019s creative (create fiction powered by your imagination)<br/><br/>&gt; trust is needed to play<br/><br/>&gt; it\u2019s cheap<br/><br/>&gt; it\u2019s highly customizable (what matters is what you agree matters)<br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261180/#Comment_261180" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T09:26:25+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the point that almost all RPGs focus on dramatic action is astute.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261348/#Comment_261348" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T16:00:09+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  4:00PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 4:01PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Niko, there's a lot of good stuff in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11655&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">the aphorisms and maxims thread</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
