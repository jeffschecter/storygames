It looks like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/miscpix/dd32.jpg" style="float: right;"/><br/><br/>Here's the story.  Daredevil <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2331&amp;Mode=like">#31</a> was the culmination of a crime drama involving Wilson "The Kingpin" Fisk, his wife, son, and underboss Sammy Silke. In the end, Silke is trapped by the machinations of the crime family and ends up turning himself in to the FBI.  The last thing we see is two FBI agents, who we've never met before, talking to Silke, who ends by giving them the information that blind Hell's Kitchen lawyer Matt Murdock is really costumed vigilante Daredevil.  This is not an unusual ending for comics.  Oh no, some big revelation that will be a problem.  The normal thing to do in such a situation is to start with our hero going about his business again.  That's how all comic book plot arcs start - our hero going about his business.  But that's not how Daredevil <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2332&amp;Mode=like">#32</a> starts.<br/><br/>Daredevil <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2332&amp;Mode=like">#32</a> starts with the head of the FBI office in New York City being called in, in his pajamas, by the two agents.  "There've been some developments, sir." one of them says, in a full two page splash that made my jaw drop. There's this huge bulletin board with photographs of Kingpin, his wife, his underlings (in a classic organized crime org-chart style), with arrows to and from pictures of Daredevil, Spider-Man, Elektra, Bullseye, the Owl, basically all kinds of crazy costumed people. Holy fucking shit.  Of course, it makes perfect sense that this should be what the FBI office in Marvel's NYC should have on the wall, but until someone showed me a character there, a life there, I had no reason to ever imagine it.  The entirety of the issue is the two FBI agents briefing their boss on the "status of the investigation into the Fisk organization", which essentially takes the entirety of the Daredevil mythos and looks at it from the point of view of law enforcement outsiders.  And of course, they've developed solid information that Matt Murdock may indeed be Daredevil.  Each of the FBI agents, and the supervisor, have clear characters and values.  In the end the supervisor says to keep up the pressure on the Fisk organization, but drop the Daredevil angle and don't let it leave this room.  As he says this, there is a single panel of one of the FBI agents listening to his order, stone-faced.  The next page of the comic is Murdock's partner, Foggy Nelson, at a newsstand. He sees a copy of a newspaper, his face takes on a horrific, terrified aspect. The last page of the comic is a full spread of the headline, clutched in Foggy's hands. "Pulp Hero Of Hell's Kitchen Is Blind Lawyer".<br/><br/>I love this issue because of the detailed, outside point of view it takes on a highly beloved, and equally detailed character and history.    In this it reminds me of the 19th century massive novel and series thereof, like <i>Bleak House</i>, <i>Les Miserables</i> and, most notably, Balzac's Human Comedy series.  In these books often we pause in the action to see how it is seen and affects characters that are removed from the main thrust of the action - and as in this case, sometimes those ancillary character's decisions have enormous, catastrophic consequences on the lives of others. As we learn in future issues, the FBI agent that leaked the information did so because he was having money and marriage problems. For literally the next 30 issues of Daredevil, over 2 years of monthly comics, everything that happens is shaped by this FBI agent's decision.<br/><br/>Okay, so on to gaming.<br/><br/>There have been many times over the years when I've tried to do this "on the other side" view of the events and characters of the campaign.  It's actually pretty hard.  One reason that the technique works in DD#32, or Dickens, is because the side characters are developed into their own personalities and drives.  The three FBI agents in DD#32, for example include one who is troubled and quiet, one who is provocative and sarcastic, and a third who is experienced, older and exasperated.  They also have their own views of costumed heroics, the Kingpin's organization, and proper and effective law enforcement.  The contention of these views and values makes their decision compelling.  When doing a "side view" of an RPG, it's difficult to establish this to the same degree.<br/><br/>When I came across Smallville, I was very happy with its treatment of Values. These Values (Duty, Power, Justice, etc.) are very important, and are rolled in every conflict there is.  It was based on this that I created this bolt-on to allow these kinds of side stories in Smallville.<br/><br/>IDENTIFYING THE SIDE CHARACTERS<br/><br/>The characters in these stories are <i>at least two</i> relationships removed from the main characters.  The main characters do not have a relationship with them, though they may know some of them, and vice versa.  In DD#32, the FBI agents don't know Matt Murdock and he doesn't know them. However, they are investigating the same organization that he is fighting, so they are aware of his activities and vice versa.  Using Smallville's 9th Season example from the book, we wouldn't use Dr. Hamilton, since he is connected directly to the Leads.  However, we could use a set of "Dr. Hamilton's colleagues" or even "the corporate team that is trying to adapt one of Dr. Hamilton's discoveries into a new product".<br/><br/>Once we have a general idea of who the side characters are, we identify the aspect of the Leads that the scene challenges.  In DD#32, the FBI agents were trying to decide on a course of action that would challenge Matt's values of Love to his friends and romantic interests and Justice to beat down the assholes of Hell's Kitchen.  You could equally challenge a Lead's Resources, Assets or Distinctions.  Probably you don't have a real meaty scene if you can't challenge at least two pieces of a Lead (or two pieces of two different Leads).  It may be fun but it's not really going to illuminate the rest of your game if you can't say what the new point of view puts at stake for the Leads.  Let's pursue that corporate team example above.  What they decide to do with Dr. Hamilton's discoveries is going to impact anyone with him on their Resources - that's two Leads right there, and why not threaten LexCorp's profitability and bring in Tess that way? Rad.<br/><br/>Now you need to individualize the characters. This is made extremely easy by the Smallville Values system.  Take 5 Values "bumps" and spread them around.  This is enough to either have a well-rounded character or someone who reeeally significantly Values one or two things.  When you write the Values statement, aim it at the kinds of issues that will come up when they pursue their goals.<br/><br/>If you want, you can pick some Assets or Resources to give to the side characters, though it's not necessary.<br/><br/>RESOLVING THINGS<br/><br/>Normally, Leads roll at least 2 dice and keep the 2 highest, always rolling a relevant Value and Relationship.  Because we've more or less decided that there are no Relationships with the Leads in the side characters, they always roll their Value <i>and the value of the Lead's Relationship, Resource or Asset</i> that their decision is most likely to affect.<br/><br/>RETURNING TO THE MAIN GAME<br/><br/>Once the side characters have resolved their Values conflict and have taken action, one or more of the Leads will have their Assets or Values challenged as a result, with nothing they could do about it!  Give them a plot point in order to get them moving to deal with the crisis the side characters have created.<br/><br/>Okay, next I'll flesh out the example of the corporate team working with one of Dr. Hamilton's discoveries to show you how this works.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293121/#Comment_293121" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T19:50:52+00:00" title="September 12, 2010  7:50PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is hot!

While it may not have the insane sense of urgency that LexCorp has (you ever notice how quick that place is to churn out some new gizmo just because the current big boss said "get to it"?), it does have more divisions, more departments, more subsidiaries and in general is a massive conglomerate of every frickin' thing you can believe.<br/><br/>First, we pick the aspects of the Leads that we\u2019re going to disrupt.  Dr. Hamilton is connected directly to Oliver (d6) and Chloe (d8 - we only use the die types in handling Resources), and we can throw in some corporate problems for Tess as a result of it too. Let's call her Power into question (that's a d10).<br/><br/>Next, we create a situation:<br/><br/>Recently, at one of those late-night shifts at Metropolis General that makes life so much fun, Hamilton treated Sam Purcell, a small-time crook, and discovered, to his surprise, that Purcell's blood contained inert forms of several Kryptonite-laced lifeforms. It seems Purcell's immune system was boosted by his exposure to something or other the last time the Blur picked him up.  Hamilton theorizes that Purcell's boosted immune system might be a way to help people with immune disorders.  If he can fight off a Kryptonian flu, he can fight off anything Earth has to throw at him!<br/><br/>However, Checkmate has been monitoring Hamilton's computers ever since he was involved, and a rogue Checkmate operative using the code name "Max" (a fake name that predates Checkmate and may even predate the CIA where it was spawned) found out the situation and kidnapped Purcell from Met Gen.<br/><br/>The story is about what happens when Goliath discovers this isn't the Kryptonian flu ("after all, that would kill everyone on the planet"), this actually is a rogue LuthorCorp bioweapon that got into the field despite their best intentions.  If they reveal this, their rival will be under attack from the authorities and will get all kinds of bad press, not to mention media attention.  But Goliath won't have the opportunity to profit from Purcell (or advance medical science) if this happens.  If they keep it a secret, it means Hamilton will have to be discredited in order that Goliath can be first to the patent office, and really, all the guy did was discover something.<br/><br/>Next, we make the side characters. Remember, all they have is Values, unless you want to get really fancy and give then an optional Asset.  The other thing they have is a single decision-making power.<br/><br/>Let's say we have a 4 person gaming group:<br/><br/>DR. HOWARD FINE is our first character. He's the head of pharmaceuticals for Goliath Industries subsidiary-of-a-subsidiary, Vycian Health.  Inventor of such amazing pharmaceuticals as Decnytrex, Pentvinlun and Ixfloxcy (thank you <a href="http://www.wordlab.com/name-generators/drug-o-matic-name-generator/" rel="nofollow">Drug-o-matic</a>), Howard is a paranoid bully who is far more interested in protecting his own hide than advancing health or science.  Howard is the only one that knows that Purcell didn't come exactly voluntarily to Vycian Health, and knows what position "Max" holds.  Howard thinks Joey wants his job.  Howard decides what happens to the Vycian Health program.  His Values are:<br/><br/>Duty: d4 - You\u2019ve got to save your own skin first.<br/>Justice: d4 - Nobody really gets what\u2019s coming to them.<br/>Power: d8 - I fought for this position.<br/>Glory: d8 - I\u2019m a brilliant doctor, me!<br/>Love: d4 - That\u2019s what secretaries are for.<br/><br/>MARY LOCKHART - A former girlfriend of Dr. Hamilton, she was booted from her position at Met Gen when she got addicted to painkillers and started lifting from the pharmacy.  She landed a glum keypunching job at Vycian, though she knows more about medicine than her position would allow.  She decides whether Dr. Hamilton is warned of Goliath\u2019s decision and/or discovery.  Her Values are:<br/><br/>Duty: d4 - Look out for number 1.<br/>Justice: d6 - What happened to me was fair.<br/>Power: d4 - Nobody is perfect.<br/>Glory: d6 - Can\u2019t anyone see how far I\u2019ve come?<br/>Love: d10 - It makes the world go \u2018round.<br/><br/>JOEY FRIEDMAN - A Vycian \u201ccompliance officer\u201d, a sleazy middle manager whose job is faking compliance with various government regulations while covering up Vycian misdeeds, Joey is stuck on Mary.  Joey decides whether someone outs LuthorCorp\u2019s bioweapon and whether Hamilton will be discredited.  His Values are:<br/><br/>Duty: d8 - The company is everything.<br/>Justice: d4 - Fuck the police.<br/>Power: d6 - Everything can change in a new york minute.<br/>Glory: d4 - The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.<br/>Love: d8 - Who wouldn\u2019t want to love THIS?<br/><br/>MURPHY - A Vycian technology consultant, concerned about the situation he (or she) finds himself in.  He\u2019s the one that discovers Purcell was messed up by LuthorCorp and not by accidental exposure. Murphy is the only one who\u2019s actually taken the time to talk to Purcell and learn that Sam was exposed when he (or she?) broke into a LuthorCorp facility.  Murphy has formed a connection with Purcell and although excited about the possibilities of what their immune system might mean for medical science, he\u2019s nervous about the ethical implications.  Murphy decides whether and how Purcell is told about the decision.<br/><br/>Duty: d4 - This company is scary.<br/>Justice: d10 - We\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right!<br/>Power: d6 - With all our resources we can accomplish great things.<br/>Glory: d4 - I\u2019d rather do something good than get a stupid certificate that says I did.<br/>Love: d6 - If we can\u2019t connect with each other, what\u2019s the point?<br/><br/>Next, we pick a starting point.  If we closed the last session with (for example), Hamilton getting a page and having to leave in a hurry, let\u2019s start this one with Murphy making the discovery about LuthorCorp and \u201cMax\u201d leaving Dr. Fine\u2019s office.<br/><br/>We play out the mini-story the same way we play Smallville - the characters interact, go places, dig into things, telegraph intents, and when everyone has smashed into each other\u2019s Values a few times, they make their key decisions in the equivalent of a \u201cTag Scene\u201d.  In these scenes, each of them faces the choice that was the key aspect of their character.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s say this time around:<br/><br/>Dr. Fine decides not to proceed with experimentation on Purcell,  Joey decides to discredit Hamilton, Murphy tells Purcell that LuthorCorp is responsible for his condition but that he may have the key to saving millions of lives in his body, Mary decides not to warn Hamilton.<br/><br/>When we return to our main story, the Leads most directly affected by Goliath\u2019s smear campaign against Hamilton are Oliver and Chloe, they each get a plot point.  If Purcell undertakes some revenge or action against LuthorCorp, then Tess will get one too.<br/><br/>I'll do another example side game. I tend to base my mini-plots around strange pictures of bands that I get from the Internet, so it seems appropriate to do one that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293262/#Comment_293262" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T16:41:31+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  4:41PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2010 4:42PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Essentially, if you'll note, what I've done is take the Smallville method of targeting relationships, and instead permitted it to target anything on the Leads' sheets, then, instead of generating the situation to tear them apart myself, I give it to the characters of the mini-game.  The important thing is to ensure that no outcome will let the Leads' sheets get away unscathed.  <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/mush/katzen2.jpg" style="float: right;"/><br/><br/>Okay, next post will be about the Katzenjammers, or at least side characters that are based on this great picture of the Katzenjammers I found on <a href="http://dukeofstraw.com/lategreats/" rel="nofollow">The Late Greats</a>, the best music blog.<br/><br/>Probably I should mention that somewhere in all of this you want to have some cohesive group of people - they're all trapped in an elevator, waiting for Spiderman to get them out, or they're undergoing one of Lucifer's performance reviews on how many mortal souls they've been able to obtain, or whatever.  Although we don't go through the relationship-creation bit that Smallville's character creation is based on, it's nice to have a bit of direction in playing an NPC: a couple of adjectives and how you feel about at least one of the other characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293806/#Comment_293806" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T14:37:41+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  2:37PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 2:45PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The great thing about using band pictures for your NPC groups is that they typically all know each other and are at some kind of ease with each other, and also they aren\u2019t typical \u201cgood looking actor\u201d types. Many are straight out weird looking.<br/><br/>So, let\u2019s say we have a setup for a game that\u2019s (looks at Feature list) Amanda Waller, Zatanna, Chloe and Bart Allen. Now that\u2019s a fucking game.  Obviously these Leads didn\u2019t all join the game at the same time, some came in later, some earlier, and so some of them don\u2019t have Relationships with each other at all. That\u2019s something we\u2019re going to expect to develop in this game.  So let\u2019s create a situation that makes people get into things together, so that a relationship can develop.<br/><br/>Obviously, as you can see from the picture in the previous post, these four women go around solving mysteries. If that picture isn\u2019t about solving a mystery, I can\u2019t think of a picture that is. In this setup, we\u2019re going to flesh out their characters a bit more, perhaps not all the way to the level of a Feature, but give them a few more interesting dice to throw around.<br/><br/>STEP 1: IDENTIFY WHAT YOU ARE ATTACKING<br/><br/>So let\u2019s look at some things that might be affected by solving a mystery.  Amanda Waller is Connected (an Asset) at d12. Woot, that\u2019s big. Ummm...Zatanna has a Family Reputation at d6? Not too bad, though with her Duty only at d4 maybe she doesn\u2019t feel she has to uphold it? Good enough, we can target something that\u2019s not there, see if she flinches.<br/><br/>STEP 2: CREATE THE SITUATION<br/><br/>Checkmate has tried to regulate not just extraterrestrial and superpowered threats, but magical threats as well.  Indeed, one of Waller\u2019s first cases involved a magical talisman that could provide enhanced power but eventually resulted in the demon of the talisman taking over the body of the practicioner.  Zatanna\u2019s father, thinking he was working with good-hearted government officials, helped the investigation, but when Waller\u2019s true nature was revealed to him, he hid the talisman away and severed all ties.<br/><br/>Obviously the talisman is back and, in the hands of Yakuza gangster \u201cElectric\u201d Robbie Kai, it is being used to claw his way to the top of the criminal underworld...and as the demon takes over, that clawing is getting more and more literal.<br/><br/>STEP 3: CREATE THE CHARACTERS TO TARGET THE SITUATION<br/><br/>These four mystery-solving BFFs are (from left to right):<br/><br/>Sabrina O'Brien<br/><br/>Sabrina, secretly a practicing witch, has astonishingly weak magical capabilities, but extensive knowledge.  For some reason, none of her pals have any clue that she has any abilities even when they\u2019re used right in front of them. <br/><br/>General RP notes: Thorough and thoughtful, admires Josie and thinks Daphne is underrated.<br/><br/>Values: <br/>Duty d6: We\u2019ve got to do something!<br/>Justice d4: There aren\u2019t any easy answers.<br/>Power d10: If I could just find the right spell...<br/>Love d4: What, you mean, like with a potion?<br/>Truth d4: Hey, look over there!<br/><br/>Abilities: Luck, Descriptor: Magic, Limits: Magic d6<br/><br/>Occult Knowledge: d6<br/>d4 trigger: Earn a plot point when you reveal you know way too much about magical information.<br/><br/>Josie Brennan<br/><br/>Josie\u2019s the lead troublemaker, pot-stirrer, big little sister and loudmouth of the group.  She\u2019s read one too many Dashiell Hammett books and thinks \u201cchin music\u201d is a great way to describe a brawl.<br/><br/>RP Notes: Cocky, brash, two steps in front of everyone, self-appointed leader. Thinks Sabrina needs to get set up with a guy, thinks Daphne needs to be smarter, has to protect her big sister Jem.<br/><br/>Values:<br/>Duty d6: What the cops can\u2019t fish out, we will.<br/>Justice d8: Grifters, gunsels and gonifs beware!<br/>Power d4: We don\u2019t need no stinkin\u2019 badges.<br/>Love d6: I\u2019ve got my peepers open...<br/>Truth d6: It\u2019s a hard world, no question.<br/><br/>Distinctions: Clever d6<br/>d4 trigger: Earn a plot point when you Choose to show off your cleverness in an annoying manner, or when tied to a chair by some no neck thug.  \u201cLet me give you loogans the lay.\u201d<br/><br/>Investigator d6<br/>d4 trigger: Earn a plot point when you Choose to take a scene investigating instead of taking immediate action.  \u201cI ain\u2019t after any two-big hop-heads, I want the high pillow!\u201d<br/><br/>Daphne C. Loudermill<br/><br/>Daphne, the ditz of the group (\u201clook around your group of friends, if you can\u2019t spot the ditz, you are the ditz\u201d), was blind since birth, but an experimental cybernetic implant returned her the use of both eyes, and a third implant in her forehead gave those eyes the ability to scope in for microscopic use.  Her mad scientist dad was often targetted by unscrupulous persons, so before you knew it she was neck deep.<br/><br/>RP Notes: Ditzy cyborg, layer your \u201cValley Girl\u201d mannerisms with computer and technological phrases.  Sabrina is completely awesome and you are her best friend! Josie can be mean and kind of weird but is usually right. Jem would be great if she\u2019d let you take her shopping.<br/><br/>Values:<br/>Duty d4: Um, if I say no, what are you gonna do?<br/>Justice d6: Hands off, buster!<br/>Power d6: Hee hee, watch this!<br/>Love d8: Compassion is the most important thing.<br/>Truth d4: We all have our own version.<br/><br/>Abilities: Super-Senses d6, Descriptor: Telescopic Sight, Microscopic Sight, Limits: Interference<br/><br/>Distinction: In Over My Head d6<br/>d4 trigger: Earn a Plot Point and Add d6 to Trouble when you leap into trouble over your head. \u201cGosh, what\u2019s going on in here?!\u201d<br/><br/>Jem Brennan<br/><br/>Jem is Josie\u2019s older sister, but usually takes a subservient position to her. She\u2019s more protective and kind-hearted than her more cynical sister and often takes on a position of conscience to the group.  Jem is the one that can find the good side of clients, or even enemies.  Nevertheless she is absolutely loyal and will never turn on a friend.<br/><br/>RP Notes: The \u201cnice girl\u201d, you may not be dumb, but you think the best of people until proven otherwise. Josie is the greatest, she takes care of everyone even if she pretends to be tough. Sabrina is...interesting. Daphne is hilarious.<br/><br/>Values:<br/>Duty d8: We have to see this thing through.<br/>Justice d4: Who am I to judge?<br/>Power d4: You have to distrust those that are interested in power.<br/>Love d6: The quality of mercy is not strained.<br/>Truth d8: There is no such thing as a comforting illusion.<br/><br/>Big-Hearted d6<br/>d4 trigger: Earn a plot point whenever you Choose to buy someone\u2019s sob story.  \u201cOf course we\u2019ll help. Won\u2019t we, Josie?\u201d<br/><br/>Martial Artist d6<br/>d4 trigger: Spend a plot point to Reroll a die whenever you redirect an opponent\u2019s momentum.  \u201cKii yah! You could have made this easy.\u201d<br/><br/><br/>STEP 4: SET THE CHARACTERS IN MOTION IN THE SITUATION<br/><br/>In this case, the characters have one goal: get \u201cElectric\u201d Robbie.  The important thing is that as they dig around and cause problems, they also unearth Waller\u2019s past (which she thought had been successfully erased) and Zatara\u2019s past (which Zatanna appears to feel no Duty to, but which she takes advantage of).  This is a more open-ended scenario than the first, there\u2019s no particular point at which you say \u201cokay, that\u2019s enough, let\u2019s switch back\u201d.  The main thing is to layer their investigation with things Waller has tried to cover up, which implicate Zatanna in an important magical situation, and even though it\u2019s not what we have planned, if there\u2019s a spot where you can implicate something on Chloe or Bart\u2019s sheet, that would be great too.  Waller's Connections will be at risk because they are pulling their support away from her in the light of these revelations. The whole magical heritage and family background of Zatanna is at risk. <br/><br/>When you switch back to the main Leads, these four will undoubtedly have created an insane tangle of situation for Zatanna and Amanda Waller to cope with emotionally and practically.  Drawing the other two into that situation is going to be a normal function of wedges and reveals.<br/><br/>Comments, questions, suggestions for improvements welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354706/#Comment_354706" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T11:55:08+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 11:55AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just so everyone knows, this stuff was fleshed out and is now in the Watchtower Report.
