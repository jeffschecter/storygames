It's got him thinking about doing some sort of story game where the enemy is Nature. Maybe it's a Fire, maybe it's a Storm, maybe it's a Drought or a Flood or whatever. The point is, it isn't at thing to kill or master, it's a thing to ride out, help get to an end, or maybe at best survive.<br/><br/>This tickled my memory bank a bit and made me think I'd read something similar here on SG. Am I imagining that or is this already a thing? If it isn't a thing, does anyone have thoughts on what might be good to hack for it? We goofed around talking about Dread but the jenga means you will eventually lose and we felt like there ought to be a mechanic for a clear "win" even if that win is just survival.<br/><br/>Thoughts from the hivemind?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330598/#Comment_330598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T11:15:22+00:00" title="June 18, 2011 11:15AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2011 11:16AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/game_chef/morningstar_danger_mountain_game_chef.pdf" rel="nofollow">Danger Mountain</a>, which is all about seventies disaster movies and environmental threats, maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh" title="Josh_Unruh"><img alt="Josh_Unruh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh">Josh_Unruh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330600/#Comment_330600" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T11:18:50+00:00" title="June 18, 2011 11:18AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hot damn, Jason, I think this is probably the thing I was thinking of.

Basically you laid the tiles out forming the space that was under attack, then you plotted the path of the plane dumping the fire retardant material or water or whatever to try to put it out, maximizing the amount of fire under the lines of the plane, with rules for how the plane turned and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
