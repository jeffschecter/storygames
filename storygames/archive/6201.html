In my DevLog there, I just did a post about meta-requirements, i.e., design parameters. Principally, these are requirements that derive from the source material and the target audience. As to the latter, the game must appeal to fans of Barry's books who are not gamers. So I developed this list, which I am cross-posting below. Thoughts on what I've got? Thoughts on anything I'm missing?<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>In the last article, I talked about the essence of the John Rain books. That is stiuff I want to make sure is in the game so it feels right. That is stuff that will make the game a John Rain game. Relatedly, there are some meta-requirements for the game. I call these "meta-requirements" because they deal not with content or feel but with tangible, macroscopic issues. Generally, these relate to the fact that the game must appeal not just two gamers but to John Rain fans who have never played a role-playing game. Here's what I have to deal with:<br/><br/>1) No Funny Dice - As some of you might know, RPGs often use oddly shaped dice ranging the full specturm of Platonic Solids. I will be the first to tell you that 20-sided dice can be a lot of fun. Alas, you can't pick one up at the local toy store or steal one from your copy of Monopoly. Accessibility demands that I stick to six-sided dice and other easily obtainable implements, e.g., coins, poker chips, etc.<br/><br/>2) A Hundred Pages - Not a fixed limit but a rough target. The core rulebooks for Dungeons &amp; Dragons top a thousand pages. I love D&amp;D, but then I'm a total design wonk. For people whose primary hobby is not gaming, the time investment to read and digest the rules must be minimal. Now, the final product might well exceed the century mark, but it will include color such as a detailed description of Tokyo and several specific locales.<br/><br/>3) Time Is of the Essence - Siimilarly, for the actual play experience, the game must be playable within a modest window. I'm shooting for two to three hours -- about the same as a feature film. The game will support an extended format as well, but it must provide an enjoyable experience within that timeframe.<br/><br/>4) The Real Deal - "Realistic" is often a four-letter word for game designers. As a group, we prefer "verisimilitude". Candidly, it is something of a semantic dodge. In some ways, when writing a game about dragons or alien bounty hunters, it makes some sense. But Barry is an absolute stickler for realism. You won't find many novelists who post errata for their work, and the relatively miniscule amount demonstrates his attention to detail. I must strive to reach the bar Barry has set.<br/><br/>5) Strategery - The game is a competitive, head-to-head game. Therefore, it must reward strategy, careful play, cunning, and foresight.<br/><br/>So between my last two posts, I have a list of stringent criteria for the game. As I said in the prior post about working from a novel, this is both a hurdle and an asset. Obviously, these critera are restrictive, but they also inform the design process greatly. When I consider a mechanic, it is a simple matter to evaluate it in light of the critera to determine its viability. Fortunately, I've had these critera in my head for awhile, and I've already got a pretty good head start on the design. So, next post, I'll dive in with the proposed core mechanic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137606/#Comment_137606" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T07:06:17+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  7:06AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does realism mean in this context?

Do you need to model physics accurately, or is your realism mandate more about representing the world of the novels accurately?</blockquote>\nAlas, both, I think. Certainly, I need to represent the novels accurately. But Barry does his leve best to ensure the novels themselves represent the real world accurately. Many of his plotlines are "ripped from the headlines", and he takes the time to correct, e.g., an error in the caliber of bullet one of the characters uses. But, as I said, I think I can sidestep some of the pitfalls of the latter aspect by keeping the game more abstract. I guess my point is that, whatever aspects of the real world I do include have to be Grade A simulation.\n<blockquote>In alternatives to no funny dice, you left out playing cards, which would seem like a natural fit.</blockquote>\nI've thought about that one a lot. Obviously playing cards are a very good resource because (a) they're even more accessible than six-siders, and (b) they have a variety of "randomization points". I'm thinking about it peripherally, but I get the feeling I'm just much more comfortable designing with dice than with cards. (Hmmm. Maybe I should force myself to use cards for this year's Game Chef?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137613/#Comment_137613" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T07:26:26+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  7:26AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2008 9:01AM by komradebob.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What kind of box will it be sold in?<br/><br/>How will you make fans of these novels aware that your game exists?<br/> <br/>What is the MSRP?<br/><br/>How long between opening the box and playing the first game?<br/><br/>What are the minimum and maximum number of players?<br/><br/>Of those 100 pages, how manty do the players need to read in order to start the very first game?<br/><br/>If only one person owns the game, how will they explain it to the other players?

For instance almost no games out there support making a death look natural. And if you do a hardcore reality simulator, your game won't either, will it? So, the goal is to introduce a mechanic that makes it seem like the best move to take money to kill people and make it look natural.<br/>\n  Like maybe you get a bonus to the assassination attempt when you do more research on the victim. Not so much as a reward mechanic, but as a mechanical explanation of why the character does what they do, right?<br/>\n  Does that make sense?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137660/#Comment_137660" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T09:58:06+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  9:58AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a strange question, Justin, have you contacted the author?<br/><br/>Not for legal CYA, but to see if he might be jazzed and interested in helping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137669/#Comment_137669" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T10:36:55+00:00" title="April  2, 2008 10:36AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Justin: Are the people playing this game going to be as hard core into the realism as the author is?

The answer:a lot of money buying pairs of dice, or a fair chunk of time tracking down a bag of d6s. No go.) I thus prefer cards. The trick with cards is to not just make them replacement dice: cards can be face down, in hand, face up, located in front of different people, they have multiple sets of information on them (numbers and suit) and a rich traditional symbol set accompanying them. You have to make use of a fair chunk of these before a card game really feels like, well, a card game.<br/><br/>Less emphasis on success or failure as the determining factor. This is a tough one to wrap my head around but: characters in novels and other media don't tend to fail at things or, if they do, they don't tend to fail for a lack of skill, but for other external reasons. We story gamers have somewhat short-circuited this with conflict resolution, but that's really a bass-ackwards way of doing it. Since I'm writing towards an audience that has some experience with authorship and fanfic, I'm increasingly using the cards as a bridging device between scenes, and possibly as a "how much do you benefit from this" device. Not sure yet. This is the part of the game I'm struggling with.<br/><br/>A new way of teaching game material may be in order. This hasn't been tested yet, but my present idea is to start with just a story, with the mechanics running alongside. Basically, the game played for you. The next bit does the mechanics for you but you make the decisions, much like a choose-your-own-adventure. The next bit you do the mechanics for yourself, but things are still heavily structured (did you get more hearts than any other suit? If so, turn to page XX). The next bit gives you a pre-structured story outline to play around. Finally, in the fifth chapter, we get to "here's a summary of the mechanics and how to create your own story outlines."<br/><br/>Now this is going to be a little different for you. But, something along these lines might be handy.<br/><br/>Pre-set characters, with the option of inventing your own. People like strong characters: they bond to them strongly. But making up strong characters is not necessarily a skill that everyone has. So, therefore, I just have the game come with four strong characters, and no choice about which to use (if you're playing one player, you play character A. If you're playing two player, you play characters A and B. Etc.) People can of course make up their own characters, but that's not an intrinsic part of the game. For you, I don't see what you couldn't have John Rain just be "the guy you play." And, sure you could make up your own cool-ass assassin dude if you wanted, also.<br/><br/>Your thing about time is also a key point. My ideal is one hour; I reach for it knowing I probably won't hit it.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that the actual rules of your game (just the bare-bones stuff) should be less than one page. That's how long Monopoly's rules are, and Monopoly is the most complicated game most people ever learn. The rest of the book can be about teaching people *how* to use the rules, and introducing them slowly.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137681/#Comment_137681" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T11:03:20+00:00" title="April  2, 2008 11:03AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I second Ben here - accurately modeling anything in a systemic way is the road to salty tears.

When you buy Monopoly, the dice are in the box. Scattegories comes with a D20 with letters on each face. I think that the "mainstream" expects to get the dice they need with the game. I think that it's less "mainstream" to use D6, and not include them expecting that the player will go get some, than it is to include a bunch of funny dice. Ala the Blue Book Basic D&amp;D, which was where the breakout started. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a corollary, games come in boxes, not in books. To the mainstream.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I'd say that if you want "mainstream" the rules should fit on, at most, a five page pamphlet. And that's pushing it. If you really want mainstream, you ought to be able to print the rules on the inside of the box cover. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Your timeframe is dead on... if there's no "campaign." That is, you play it once, for three hours, and it's over. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. With Realism, less is often more. The more you try to make rules that seem "realisitic" the more the realism slips away from you, and it becomes apparent that you're playing a model. Let the players inject the realism by empowering them to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. The biggest reward you can have for employing strategy is to declare a winner at the end. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. You may be aware, but just to be sure, I'm of the opinion that one should not try to design RPGs for the mainstream, because the mainstream doesn't want RPGs. That is, there are enough "potential gamers" in amongst the mainstream crowd that will play with the RPG assumptions intact.

This has the added advantage of letting players self-scale the level of detail to their comfort level.

This is of particular concern for me because, in the John Rain novels, we know that Rain isn't going to die, and we know that ultimately he will succeed in some capacity. Obviously, that doesn't work very well for a game. By the same token, the game shouldn't permit Rain to get offed by one of the bad guys lowly henchmen in the first scene.<br/><br/>My present thought on this is to have the two sides of the game (predator and prey) deal in different "currency". So, in all of the scenes leading up to the showdown when the predator "fails" at something, he isn't thwarted; rather, the prey builds up, say, "complications". Then, in the final showdown, the prey can "spend" these complications to make that final scene challenging. This also gives me the benefit of dealing with a final showdown between characters of differing power levels. E.g., how is a middle-aged business man supposed to compete with a lethal assassin?\n<blockquote>Pre-set characters, with the option of inventing your own.

Strategy games are a great expression of robust rules that can be expressed succinctly.

When you're talking about an audience of John Rain fans (or, in my case, an audience of Yaoi fans), these are people who like serial stories. I don't see why they shouldn't like serial games. But that should be a goal, not a crutch. I think that the ideal should be to make each session total self-contained, but totally expandable to a serial level if you so desire.<br/><br/>So talking about games for mainstream audiences often becomes a very confused discussion, and I think it's because people aren't clear about what mainstream audience they're targeting. You've got your head on straight about this -- you're targeting fans of the books -- so I didn't mention it before. But since we're continuing this discussion in public it might be useful for someone else. Are there John Rain fanforums, internet role-playing (in forums, blogs, what have you) or other such things? You might want to take a look at what they're doing. Not necessarily actively soliciting input, but just observing: what are the important aspects of the books to these people? What do they argue about and how? In a internet roleplaying environment, how do they they dance around disagreements and what are the disagreements about? You don't need to have this restrict your design, but it's a great way to inspire it.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137710/#Comment_137710" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T12:26:20+00:00" title="April  2, 2008 12:26PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll agree with you, Ben, on your point about Campaign play, if you agree that what we're saying is that John Rain fans are more likely to be "potential gamers" than the average "mainstream" crowd. Again, the whole point being that I think that RPG is such a strange activity in it's most basic form (you know, "acting" like a character), that worrying about which element may alienate whom isn't going to be effective. <br/>\n<br/>\nMake a game you know is fun for yourself, and those like you will play it. Don't worry if those "mainstream" folks, who don't share your proclivities, won't like it. They won't, and there's not much to be done about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an analogy, let's say we were writing music for the movie version of the books. And we're a country band. Are you going to suggest that we try to record a metal album because you believe that more of his fans are into metal than country? In that case I'd give up and hand it over to a metal band. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou want to make a RPG... make a RPG, Justin. Make it the best RPG you can, and forget about what you think the demographics demand. If it's good some small segment will play it. If you design to some imagined market demand, and it's not a great game, then nobody will play. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if the best game you can make happens to meet some of these criteria... well, it's still the best game you can make. So great. Just don't compromise anything to get that best game. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137711/#Comment_137711" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T12:37:53+00:00" title="April  2, 2008 12:37PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An RPG Mike, a<b>n</b> :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137714/#Comment_137714" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T12:53:59+00:00" title="April  2, 2008 12:53PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Generally speaking, even a large number of d6 is hard to find (I did an experiment: how long would it take me to buy 12d6 at a non-game store?

Let's say I purchase a board game, and I get home, and it says that I need a six inch ruler to play. And I don't have one. Sure, I can go to the five and dime and get one.

Or it could be to win against others at a particular board game.<br/><br/>The more you describe it as competition, the more likely anyone who does play will be playing for the latter example. You can't have your cake and eat it to - you can't think "Hey, they'll decide to play for competition, but then THIS rule will make them want that lesson thing".<br/><br/>I will say a game like capes uses competition in play, but it isn't <i>about</i> competition. You don't decide to play it just to win against others - winning isn't a feature you play it for. If your talking about using competition as a component rather than a feature, ah, I see.
