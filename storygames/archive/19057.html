We roll a lot of dice to determine success or degree of success for many kinds of actions. What is a good ratio of success to failure in your game?  There are certainly times as a GM that a player ends up in a situation where I REALLY want them to make a roll.  Not just because it would further the story but also because there are times where, narratively, it would be SO COOL.  It's not just a numbers game either... there are always CERTAIN rolls that we want to go one way or another.  <br/><br/>Failure is pretty crappy if it comes at a bad time.  I've seen and run games where the player tries to do something really cool which advances the story and would make them look pretty badass... and they miss.  Everyone feels a little let down.  If that were a movie... people would have left the theater at that point.  So failure is pretty terrible.  You could make a game (and it would still be a game) where the players never fail.  (You could use a, "Yes... AND" mechanic.)  However... without the expectation of failure we would lose a lot of thrill with our successes. <br/><br/>There are a lot of games that deal with this in different ways.  What games are more successful at this?  What have you done in your games to make the successes and failures come at better times?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425510/#Comment_425510" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T00:15:41+00:00" title="December  9, 2013 12:15AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To explore this issue, I think you need to understand the nature of failure as well as success.<br/><br/>If by failure all you mean is a "miss" then I totally get how that might be dramatically disappointing.

You can use this in ANY game from D&amp;D to AW.  The classic example is the thief in the dungeon.  There is a locked door with PLOT behind it.  The thief rolls to pick the lock.  The thief fails.  Plot remains undiscovered.... thank you for playing.  Games have dealt with this with things like "Taking 20" but Failing forward says that the OUTCOME is bad, not necessarily the skill.  We bring the roll into the META of the story not just the simulation.  So... the thief fails the roll but DOES pick the lock and instead of him just opening the door, the lock emits a loud crack and echoes up and down the corridors of PLOT HALLWAY and demons can be heard in the distance.  Using this kind of mechanic is similar to the, "Yes...and" mechanic i talked about in my OP. <br/><br/>If used all the time for failed rolls then characters do not fail at any given task, so success is not as valued.  The thief was ALWAYS going to pick the lock... it's just a question of him ending up in a crappy situation or not.  So success becomes less interesting from a narrative point of view.<br/><br/>Failing forward can also be used like you desribe.\n<blockquote>If a failed roll advances the story somehow however (eg, leads to capture or some other way in which the stakes are raised) then it isn't disappointing at all in my view.</blockquote>\nYou can turn the failure into something more interesting.  It is difficult to keep upping the stakes every time a bad dice roll comes up but that also reduces the value of success because EVENTUALLY we will succeed.  The GM can up the stakes all he wants but he won't fail us.\n<blockquote>On a straight up binary success/fail?  66% success rate is a good target.  Too far below that, and the high frequency of failures are frustrating.  Too far above, and the low frequency of failures make the successes boring.<br/></blockquote>\nYea, but just giving a number isn't good enough... it's about the RIGHT 66%.  We've all had those moments where we rolled a natural 20 but we were disappointed because we didn't NEED it then.  We've also had those failures at times when it just broke your heart because it would have been SO COOL to have this one go off well.  So we have to find a way to maintain the social contract with our players while still making the success and failure happen at interesting and fun times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425518/#Comment_425518" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T03:12:55+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  3:12AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 4:54AM by Rickard.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You could make a game (and it would still be a game) where the players never fail.

Conditions are HP. 2: the conditions are nasty; the higher-end conditions subtract dice from your roll (high skills are rated at 4 or 5, and there's two high-end conditions that subtract one die apiece; with your lower skills, that's almost a sealed fate), and lower-end conditions still do nasty things like increasing the difficulty of all rolls. Or preventing you from using certain things to your advantage.<br/><br/>Complications are indeed a double whammy (for example, a monster appears, or you get split up, or lose supplies), but they can often be preferable to conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425582/#Comment_425582" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T12:36:01+00:00" title="December  9, 2013 12:36PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 12:37PM by TildeSee.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, they certainly don't get to choose whether they succeed and take the condition or fail with a complication. It's less "they can" and more "the GM chooses". That might be pedantry, though, so bluh.<br/><br/>Conditions are fierce for a number of reasons, some of which CG touched on. They're pretty fierce and take away your options and resources. For example, Hungry saps away one point of precious disposition in conflicts, which puts you one step closer to defeat in a conflict. Afraid disallows you from attempting skills untrained, or helping others (my players learned to hate this one more than anything). Dead is a condition, but can only be inflicted when you're already either Injured or Sick, or if you fail particular types of conflicts. Additionally, you accrue a Condition at the end of every 4th turn, in increasing severity based on the conditions you already have, and as CG points out if you already have the rest you get Dead. Before Dead there are only six conditions, so even if some of them are trivial to take care of you want to make sure you're not in a position to get the Dead condition. <br/><br/>With all of that, even though a condition comes with success, sometimes it's nice to know that the only thing you have to worry about is that, well, not only were you unable to pick that lock but now your lockpick is jammed all the fuck up in the lock, bent to shit. We can still kick the door down if it's that important, right?

For this, I'd avoid rolls for vital progress (Plot Hallway), and instead use rolls for character impact.  You can still roll <i>when</i> you pick the lock, but the roll is not <i>about</i> picking the lock.  The lock is going to open either way.  What's at <i>stake</i> is whether the character gets level-drained in the process.<br/><br/>You could use this rule either (a) always, so players get used to it, or (b) only when failure isn't acceptable, in which case that fact would need to be called out.<br/><br/>I don't think there's any way that the specific suspense of "can my character accomplish this task?" can coexist with "only one possible answer is acceptable" in the same moment.  If you want to split the difference, though, you could just put resources at stake as a second step -- <i>if</i> the roll fails, <i>then</i> the player needs to spend something they didn't want to spend.  But if the roll succeeds, you get that "Yay I won!" experience*, and the prospect of <i>not</i> getting that experience introduces some tension.<br/><br/>* unless you're too system-conscious, like I am                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425627/#Comment_425627" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-10T11:15:17+00:00" title="December 10, 2013 11:15AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My latest rules use no dice rolls unless players put forward different ideas on what happens, and even then both actions happen unless the dice roll winner specifically says - No they didn't happen.<br/><br/>The reason for this is that I've noticed that once a story is told that everyone remembers it even if it fails the roll so they act as though it happened anyway. <br/><br/>I was with you on the need to have a chance to fail being needed to have a game be exciting.

(You could say that it moves the <i>story</i> forward, but then you're talking about the mechanics from a perspective that's not rooted in the character...and when we're talking about why whiffs feel bad to a player, we want to take a perspective rooted in the character, not in the meta.)

The MC move turn their move back on them is a good example of making the move outcome even worse.  There's a difference to the player if they screwed up SO BAD that I get to turn their move back on them after a failed role versus me using Announce future badness as my move.  It's all preference when you use what moves.   Sometimes the move you make is a direct response of the failure and makes the fact that the player failed so much worse to the player.\n<blockquote>"<a href="/forums/profile/Golux">@Golux</a>, it sounds to me like you want stakes that players care about but which won't derail play.

I agree that actions required to move the story along shouldn't have that kind of black and white success roll. (That's just bad GMing.)  It's just used as an example.   But you're right with the level of success being the issue or the stakes of the success.  I'm trying to parse how the players will perceive the change in goal for the roll.   If I'm running a game where lockpicking is a thing, then it seems like I have to have some kind of consistency when locks get picked.  It would seem frustrating to me if a GM at will changed my role from a question of success to a question of the measure of success.  If I'm going to succeed on this roll no matter what then it seems strange that I failed on that not-so-important-door I tried to pick the lock of earlier.<br/><br/>I feel like there needs to be that consistency lest I violate the social contract between players and GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425651/#Comment_425651" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-11T02:46:40+00:00" title="December 11, 2013  2:46AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2013 2:47AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed, this is something players will care about.  I see a number of possible approaches:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> Just get buy-in up front from the whole group that sometimes the GM will remove pass/fail from a roll for the good of the game.  Then when it comes up in play, GM announces it so no one gets blind-sided.  (I wouldn't try this unless your group communicates extremely well about this sort of thing.)<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Break the expectation that the skills on the character sheet dictate what gets rolled.  Make it clear that nothing gets rolled outside of certain game criteria, such as risk, difficulty, stakes, or whatever is right for your game.  For example, "Never roll unless the thing you're doing could injure someone."  If you're picking a lock and no one could be hurt, don't roll.  If someone could be hurt, <i>then</i> you get to care about the Lock Picking number on your sheet.  Probably a bad example, but my point is that it's consistent and easy to apply, and players won't be confused or surprised.<br/><br/>Another example: <i>Sorcerer</i> says "Only roll when there's a <i>conflict between characters</i> (NPCs included)."  I think that's an interesting one.  Might not suit you, but maybe illustrates some possibilities.<br/><br/><b>3)</b> If your group can handle the above, then you get more options with Deliverator's suggestion about Scene Types.  Yeah, lockpicking works differently at different times, but those different times are all explicitly labeled.<br/><br/><b>4)</b> Manage your target/difficulty numbers.  If you've accidentally GMed yourself into a situation where it's okay to injure a character but not okay for them to fail at Lock Picking, just establish that this lock is not hard to pick ("difficulty 2").  This should probably be used in tandem with the next approach:<br/><br/><b>5)</b> Standardize a consequence system beyond pass/fail.  Whether it's "see if you get hurt" or "see if you need to spend" or "some unrelated bad thing" or a roll on a random table -- do this <i>every</i> time dice are rolled.  So, even when it's okay for me to fail at picking a lock, and even when I'm mostly excited about whether or not I succeed, there's <i>also</i> a chance for other stuff to go wrong (or to go well!).  Just as the GM controls difficulty numbers for pass/fail, the GM can also control likelihood numbers for good/bad consequences (if you find that fun).  <br/><br/>If this sounds like too many steps, there are ways to streamline it -- results of the pass/fail roll can double as consequence triggers (even, odd, matching, highest, lowest, etc.).<br/><br/><b>6)</b> Something that might make the preceding ideas more intuitive to some players: Use broader skill categories, like a Thief Background without any specifics like Lock Picking.<br/><br/><b>7)</b> I've saved this for last, as I assume it's farthest from what you want, but it's also the easiest option, so I'll say it just in case.  Make Lock Picking <i>not</i> be a thing.  Instead use other sorts of events to trigger rolls.  Example: character stats/skills in Danger, Fear, Precision, etc. will be rolled when the fictional situation is dangerous, or scary, or requires precision, completely regardless of what task the character is performing.  (I'd consider this a simpler and less half-assed version of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above, but it does eliminate some stuff you might not want to lose.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
