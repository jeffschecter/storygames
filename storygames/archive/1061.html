<p>... and this one time, I had a funny thought.  What on earth will people do when "most" gamers are, in fact, indie gamers?</p>
<p>Are we even going to realize when this happens?  Has it happened <em>already</em>?</p>

                            Depending on how you count, the "majority" are arguably already (a) "simmers" or (b) MMO players or (c) various breeds of historical reenactors.

                            In probably the same thread, some guy was throwing around the claim that 90% of the RPG hobby is D&amp;D.  It always amuses me when this totally unsupported, totally unverifiable "fact" is thrown around.<br/><br/>I've played D&amp;D once.  Out of the people that I speak with on a regular basis, lots of them are gamers.  None of them play D&amp;D.  Most of them never have.  But all of that is just as anecdotal as the guy who thinks 90% of the hobby is D&amp;D because 90% of his friends play D&amp;D.                        </div>

                            It depends on how you define gamer, sure, but if we define for the moment gaming as playing some form of tabletop rpg (so not including forum based gaming or MMORPGS) then I struggle with the argument that the hobby is not DnD and some other stuff.<br><br>Not because I like DnD, I don't as it happens, but because you just need to look at what is selling.  Saying that DnD doesn't dominate the hobby is wishful thinking, plain and simple, take a look at what sells, at what gets space in shops, at what gets most online discussion (and remember Enworld when doing that).<br/><br/>If indie games were getting that big Hasbro would be putting money into them, there would be a Dogs in the Vineyard MMORPG, at Gencon the Forge booth would be huge and so on.<br/><br/>The new kinds of games coming through are great, I don't think they need people redefining what is popular in the way that is being attempted here to protect them.  They stand on their own merits, the fact that DnD is more popular in no way diminishes them.<br/><br/>Oh, and why exclude MMORPGS and freeform stuff?  Because if we don't that's the hobby and the discussion is over, those are much bigger hobbies.  However, as somone who has played freeform and MMORPGS and still plays tabletop I feel quite happy saying they really are not the same thing.  Related sure, but not the same thing.  I enjoy all of them, but lumping them into one hobby doesn't really help anything - there is no stigma in including or excluding, merely utility for the purposes of discussion.                        </br></br></div>

                            The argument that "If these games were really all that popular, Hasbro would have bought it already" is suspect.  By definition, the indie gaming scene is populated by people who aren't looking to relinquish creative control over their material--and I'd guess most of the designers over at the Forge are strongly opposed to the "three-tier" model of selling games.  To hear Ron Edwards tell it, there have been some companies interested in publishing his designs, and it just didn't make economic sense from his perspective to give up control of his stuff.<br/>
<br/>
As to sales of this stuff in general: one of these days, I'd like to see a consolidated RPG industry sales chart.  I know that Dogs and Burning Wheel sell pretty good for indie games--but I think those numbers are around 6000 copies a year (correct me if I'm wrong, somebody).  I suspect the D&amp;D core books sell about an order of magnitude higher, but I'm totally making that number up!                        </div>

                            Paul Czege recently posted that My Life with Master, widely viewed as one of the best indie designs in recent years and explicitly cited by Allen Varney as an influence on the new edition of Paranoia, has sold around 1000 copies.<br/><br/>I have one of that 1000.  I've played the game.  It deserves the plaudits it gets.  Hell, it deserves a lot more plaudits.<br/><br/>I don't think though that 1000 copies is quite challenging DnD yet.<br/><br/>On the Hasbro front, they wouldn't necessarily buy an existing designer, but there is nothing to stop them getting their own guys to do likewise.  You hand your staffer a dozen or so popular indie games (popular for indie anyway) and tell him to do something similar.<br/><br/>It might not work, but it can certainly be tried.  If a guy in his garage can do it, Hasbro probably can too.                        </div>

<p>First:  I'm not invested in the claim that we're majority.  We're probably not.</p>
<p>Now, second (and somewhat contrary):  I think that argument "Much more money is spent marketing and buying D&amp;D" is essentially independent of the question of what people play.  <em>Especially</em> since, frankly, those companies tend to throw away money on marketing that's not cost-effective, because they believe in having big booths and a dominating high ground in conventions.  Whatever.</p>
<p>You wanna know how many hundreds (perhaps thousands) of dollars I spent, back in the day, on games that I couldn't ... indeed, never intended to ... play?</p>
<p>If you tell me that D&amp;D sells ten times as many core-books as DitV, I am not ready to concede that D&amp;D <em>therefore</em> has ten times as many people playing it.  It might have twenty times as many.  It might have half as many.  The data doesn't have implications.</p>
<p>Third (contrary again):  I do, in fact, buy the notion that more people talking about their play is a good indicator of more people playing.  So ENWorld strikes me as good evidence.</p>
<p>So, yeah ... we almost certainly aren't majority.  Yet.  And I bet that if we ever <em>become</em> majority, it'll take at least five years before that fact is clearly recognized.  I find that funny.</p>

                            Recognised by whom?<br/><br/>By the gaming world, whatever that is, yeah five years or more.  <br/><br/>By the wider world?  I doubt it would ever be recognised, I think we'd need to rename the hobby before the wider world stopped linking it to DnD.<br/><br/>Which come to think of it might not be such a bad thing.  Instead of saying "I play rpgs" and getting "oh, like DnD you mean?" I could say "I play Adventure Games" and get "oh, like Broken Sword you mean?"<br/><br/>Hm, well, that may need more work on reflection...<br/><br/><br/>On play, my strong but unprovable suspicion is that DnD is actually much bigger than we think.  I suspect that a great many DnD players just keep on playing year after year without recourse to the web and so are invisible.  I suspect a great many DnD players don't even know that 3e and 3.5e exist.  But, by the nature of their not being online I have no way to check if I'm right or not.                        </div>

                            Ah.<br/><br/>Assuming x = the time at which indie games are the majority and y = the time at which rpg.net posters inclined to use that argument will accept that the facts have changed x = y will occur around June 2052, give or take a month.<br/><br/>None of which means that it may not sometimes be valid to use that argument in the meantime.  As a rule though, it should only IMO be used reactively to silly assertions.  Player A "people don't like games with lots of combat in them" I think can legitimately be answered with "Most gamers (who only play mainstream games) would disagree with you." although it could just as well be countered with I suspect "Most gamers (who only play weird-ass hippy commie freak indie games) would disagree with you."                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>In probably the same thread, some guy was throwing around the claim that 90% of the RPG hobby is D&amp;D.  It always amuses me when this totally unsupported, totally unverifiable "fact" is thrown around.<br/><br/>I've played D&amp;D once.  Out of the people that I speak with on a regular basis, lots of them are gamers.  None of them play D&amp;D.  Most of them never have.  But all of that is just as anecdotal as the guy who thinks 90% of the hobby is D&amp;D because 90% of his friends play D&amp;D.</blockquote>
Joshua, you don't have D&amp;D players in your circle because you don't have anything to talk about with them. Therefore, the only gamers you know are gamers that are interested in the sort of gaming you might find interesting.<br/><br/>I've run across enough people who only know/play D&amp;D that I'm pretty convinced that most roleplayers in my country never heard of or played much else - but they don't really interact with what I'd call the roleplaying community; I suspect that anyone who gets active online and starts showing up at cons, even if he's heavily into D&amp;D, gets exposed to other games, freeform and settings that aren't fantasy. But I think that there's a "silent majority" of folks that just play with their own group of friends, and probably move on to computer/online games when their group drifts apart. Just like the majority of people who read SF&amp;F never attend cons or go online to rant about it.<br/><br/>And even if you get exposed to the RPG community on the fringes, it's still most likely you're playing D&amp;D, simply because that's what the majority of people know and play.<br/><br/>I listened to an interesting interview with a guy called Steve ("Stan!") Brown on the Godzilla Gaming Podcast, who wrote "the best-selling RPG of all time" - The Pokemon adventure game - and he says that this D&amp;D majority thing is backed by market research, etc. He also makes the good point that most people aren't interested in learning a different game system - they just want to stick with the one they know and with which they are most likely to find other people to play with them. Indie RPGs just have a fraction of the remaining fraction.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=123</a><br/><br/>DitV has sold between a thousand and two thousand copies.<br/><br/>The sales figures for DnD aren't ten times that, they're more than a HUNDRED times that, and that was for the FIRST print run.  More have gone into print since then.<br/><br/>Let's assume that one in a hundred people who own a copy of the DnD game actually play regularly.  This is a hugely conservative number.<br/><br/>Let's assume that EVERYONE who owns DitV plays regularly.  This is a wildly optimistic number.  I know my copy is presently sitting on the shelf unused.<br/><br/>There are still many more people playing DnD than play Dogs.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be willing to say that DnD was no longer in the majority until the distribution figures for such games get well past the four digit range.                        </div>

                            It's amazing what a multi-million dollar marketing budget can do for a company, especially when it's supported by many other games (WotC's other products + Hasbro brand name).<br/>
<br/>
I bought D&amp;D because I was a Magic the Gathering fan (still am). D&amp;D's books are full of pretty pictures, and they introduced me to a new fascination. I fell in love with the idea of D&amp;D, but ultimately became disillusioned, and started looking for other solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my point: you can't convert a D&amp;D fan. Just like you can't convert an atheist. They've got to come to the realization that there is something wrong on their own, before you can try to evangelize the indie rpg scene.                        </div>

                            It may be a bit late, but does it matter?<br/><br/>I mean, I wholly agree with Vaxalon's analysis of the numbers.  I found it a bit bizarre people thought otherwise, but so what?<br/><br/>My Life with Master has sold maybe a thousand copies.  DitV maybe 2000.  Both games are great, both are having a real impact on the state of the art, not just in the indie scene but beyond it.  Mongoose's D20 Conan game included elements drawn from Sorceror &amp; Sword, or so one of the designers told me over a beer one night.  He was inspired by S&amp;S and it affected his design.  Allen Varney has said that Paranoia XP contains mechanics inspired by MLwM.  These games matter.<br/><br/>Now, the truth is DnD is vastly more played and probably always will be.  Fine.  These games still matter.  Sometimes size really doesn't matter.                        </div>

                            Yeah. That's more or less what I was going to say; that cultural changes happen more by assimilation than conversion. <br/><br/>Also that some people buy rpgs and don't play and others play but don't buy.                        </div>

                            Just a personal anecdote concerning one gaming group out of many for all of you to chew on.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 35, and play in a one group, but I have a friend, a 16 year old who babysits my kids, who plays in another group. This other group plays D&amp;D exclusively. Not d20 games, or any variation, but D&amp;D. I've tried to show him other games, to expand his horizon on the possibilities of RPGs. He's well aware of rpg.net and so has internet access to other games. He's even briefly looked at my collection of games. He's not interested, *because* those other games are not D&amp;D. <br/>
<br/>
Here's the thing...he even admits that his play experience sucks, that he rarely has fun, but he avidly defends D&amp;D and always purchases the latest releases. Why? Because it is D&amp;D.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about majorities or sales numbers or marketing... but I know it matters little to someone who has brand loyalty.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kruug</cite><br/>Which brings me to my point: you can't convert a D&amp;D fan. Just like you can't convert an atheist. They've got to come to the realization that there is something wrong on their own, before you can try to evangelize the indie rpg scene.</blockquote>
I have to disagree a bit, here.  There are absolutely and verifiably folks out there who play both D&amp;D and indie games, and enjoy both.  While I admit there are also folks who want to play D&amp;D and nothing else (just as there are folks who want to play indie RPGs and nothing else), there's a significant community who enjoys variety, and thus don't require conversion, and probably not even evangelization of a "scene".<br/><br/>If you can show them that a game can give 'em a few hours of fun with some friends, they'll play it.<br/><br/>On the general topic, though, I agree with the people saying that the influence of the indie scene on the wider gamer world is better measured through the influence on the designers of mainstream games.  Heck, isn't Mike Mearls doing development at WotC these days? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Kreskin predicts that 4e D&amp;D will basically ignore indie development and try to become more MMORPG-like. Why would they want to use an idea that appeals to a smaller number of people when they can use an idea that appeals to a larger number of people? Marketing, sure, but why stack the deck against yourself?                        </div>

                            Marketing is a way of purchasing connectedness, which means that you (think you) don't have to do stuff that is actually good. Also, if you're spending so much money, you want to be safe, which means not being innovative.<br/>
<br/>
When you can't afford marketing, the only way you get to spread your stuff is by demonstrating that it's cool. Hence, on average, cooler stuff comes out of indy sources than big industry sources.                        </div>

                            Hasbro's trouble knowing what to do with D&amp;D has nothing to do with marketing and everything to do with their more general corporate viewpoint. They don't take risks, they don't even really concern themselves with quality of play; they manage brands. That's it. Generally with an eye towards spreading them into every corner they can. The staff at WotC will serve that viewpoint or get replaced.                        </div>

                            I disagree that there's such a huge difference between MMORPGs and roleplaying that you can't strike out towards MMORPGs and still be roleplaying. <br/>
<br/>
For a lot of roleplayers: <br/>
<br/>
* Community is important - guilds, areas, etc. vs. your local gaming store bulletin board and "network externalities" (hyuck hyuck)<br/>
* Extensibility is important - gotta find the latest cool thing vs. gotta buy the latest cool supplement<br/>
* Advancement is important - gotta get that next level to take on that next challenge<br/>
* Combos are important - wow, this feat is great / hey, if I take this Merit and combine it with this Discipline / look how these Capes sheets fit together!<br/>
<br/>
And so on. There's a ton of parallels. <br/>
<br/>
I don't like it much either and I hope Kreskin is wrong, but Kreskin predicts businesses follow the money.                        </div>
