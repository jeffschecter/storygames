We had Gran'pa John (Willem), the 1,000 year old crusty (both literally and figuratively) ghoul, the fixture of the establishment, the "soul of the bar" (yes, that was one of his edges).  He's obsessed with bringing down civilization but more than that, really, he's the ever-grumbling but underneath-it-all (in that ghoul way) sweet old guy who provides mentoring and guidance to all those young ghouls who "just don't get it."  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had our celebrity drop-in of the week (Rebecca, she forewarned us she had to leave before the game ended, though thankfully she was able to be in 90% of it), playing the upwardly-mobility-obsessed ("chasing a dream that can never be true," as my notes recorded it) Gwenda, the witch bartendress serving all sorts of concoctions (literally, name your poison), including many people don't ask for.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChris playing Carrie Darklight, a very close-to-normal if extremely naive/rather clueless but sweet heart of gold 19 year old college sophomore occultist-wannabe whose finally "found people who understand her" (yes, this cast of ghouls, witches, and such!), a brand new waitress.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJackson played Derek Batfeeder, an impulsive young musician who made a hasty deal with the devil to be a "darkwave virtuoso," without thinking through there's such as virtualy no fans of the genre; his deal has turned him into a young ghoul and now he's coping with the biggest mistake of his life and how it haunts him, a depressed (but in that goth I-like-it way) barfly at Beth's Underground.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast but not least, Jennifer played Zoe Martin, a fresh thrall to a vampire, a woman who thought she'd be turned into a vampire of course but instead was turned into a ghoul and, really worse than that, the ever-put-upon slave for all of her lord Victor's petty requests (such as getting his dry cleaning); she's trying to get over her disappointments after trying for the dreams of the glamorous vampire life as well as deal with her love-hate relationship with her dark (and very petty) lord (who does have great regard for her but buries it under a veil of vampiric imperiousness). <br/>\n<br/>\nWillem's play really did form a nice anchor for the show, for the other players, and I won't forget the hilarious scene where he teaches Jackson's Derek about how to make like you're hit by a car backing out of a garage so as to fool the driver into stopping (if not getting out) and thereby being eaten.  Everyone really contributed the right elements for the show to move along and to have the right character balance; there were some nice family scenes, especially the scene where Carrie bonds with Gran'pa in the cemetary (Carrie's personal set), and Gwenda, smoking nearby (her on smoke break was her personal set), walking over to quietly hand Carrie a book of REAL magic potions and also providing a nice bonding moment as she gives a sentence (sadly, I didn't get it down exactly) to the young Carrie showing her interest in helping the young woman on the path to real magic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of my favorite running gags in the show centered around Zoe's relationship with Victor's ashes (he got staked but his demonic soul continued to command her from hell!  don't worry, he got better...), there were lots of jokes by all and well-played moments by Jennifer in how Zoe "dabbled" with his ashes, including some ash-snifffing (nothing like the erotica of snorting a few grains of the remains of your vampire lord!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sorry Rebecca had to go, but the climax was a great moment of Seinfeld-like convergence as Gran'pa John's and Derek's pursuit of human prey collided with Zoe's hunt, aided by a not-really-getting-this Carrie's assistance, for the right mortal coil to restore Victor into.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, Carl mentioned in passing about the high individual card getting narration although whoever gets the most reds succeeds, and somehow I just spaced that when we played, so duh moment for me, and players, sorry about that!  But we were all pretty cooperative, as I recall, in narration, so I don't think this "mattered" TOO much at least in how we played it (there was a lot of "here's an idea" and "does that sound good?"), but I .do want to mention/admit this to the players as well as remind myself, and surely this had some impact in that there were successes I had that I narrated that someone else should have (though my side of course still had to have been successful).  But it was equal at least in that we were consistent.  Still, sorry, folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee also index of my various GPNW game commentaries at http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=147473 ([Go Play NW2008] It's Over! # 26)<br/>\n<br/>\n(was just edited re paragraph-ing)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147500/#Comment_147500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T00:39:19+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 12:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really fun!<br/><br/>Checking my copy now I see on p66 that narration is shared, and the high card just tells who has the job of synthesizing the contributed narration.

It doesn't have to be "very special," but seriously a second episode after a break for a year would be fun and I'd like to think we could use Go Play to develop something specific like this, creating a continuity experiment.  PTA is good because if we're playing the same character, aside from taking some time to just sit and chat and get back into the characters, the game would go swiftly because there's no setup time, and so we could do it easily in 2-3  hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147525/#Comment_147525" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T03:38:13+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  3:38AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>Frazier</em> spun off of <em>Cheers</em>, there's no reason <em>Beth's Underground</em> couldn't have its own spin-off.<br/><br/>Celebrity guest?
