I am going to be trying a game of Microscope with my regular board gaming group shortly and I'm really excited about it.  It fills a niche I've been looking for for some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I Know My Group and one thing that makes me very apprehensive is the mechanics for playing out a Scene.  Nobody in my group has any familiarity with storygaming at all; there's a couple that I think will take to it like a duck to water, a bunch that have no real experience roleplaying in any form, and a couple that I think will have real problems with the Scene stuff, possibly game-breaking problems.  They're a Type: the kind of roleplayers that are aggressively simulationist/gamist, they like the trappings of the setting/milieu but are mostly focused on identifying with their character and Winning with that character and doing whatever they think will best benefit that character.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons that we don't play trad RPGs with this group is that reconciling these play styles with these people has proven problematic in the past.  "Well, just don't play with those guys" is not an acceptable option; the reason we play board games is that it is a form of gaming everyone can enjoy without these issues coming up.  Maintaining a good mood in the group is more important than any particular game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo having said all that, I'd still kind of like to give Microscope a shot, but without the freeform Scene play.  I was tossing around the following possible house rule for Scenes:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The current player States the Question and Sets the Stage as normal.  He then begins describing the events of the scene in as much length and detail as he wishes, as long as he does not answer the question.  At some point, he must stop and nominate someone else at the table.  That person must then continue narrating the scene, and finish it by answering the question.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rather obvious problem here is that it takes a lot of the interactivity out of scenes - hell, it takes all the <i>roleplaying</i> out of Scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may just be being a big 'fraidy-cat on this issue, as well, but there are some significant divisions in the group as a result of the last time we tried to run a trad RPG, so I'm nervous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts? Suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374132/#Comment_374132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T14:47:07+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  2:47PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could probably do it with dictated scenes, or just go straight to voting:<br>State the Question and Set the Stage (and possibly include/exclude characters?)<br>Starting to the current player's left, each player dictates an Answer/outcome, ending with the current player.<br>Finger vote between the proposed answers.<br>Next scene.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374134/#Comment_374134" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T14:54:00+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  2:54PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cy's answer sounds reasonable.<br><br>You might also keep it in reserve, though, after trying the game RAW to see if there's even a problem.

It's not that these guys are intentionally disruptive or using "well, I'm just playing my character" as an excuse for antisocial behaviour or anything, they just get tightly focused on their character's "success" in an RPG context.  I think they'd be just fine with Periods and Events, but we had a pretty unsatisfactory session of a Star Trek RPG that really highlighted the clash of play styles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, screw it.  I'll run them through the RAW and let the chips fall where they may.

That's an option in Microscope as well, right? As I understand the game text, you'd only be doing scenes where the subject matter and tightened sufficiently for a living curiousity to compel a scene: as long as the group is merely abstractly interested, there's no need for a scene. If a scene is happening, then presumably the reason is that there is an overwhelming curiousity towards playing it out. If it's just part of the group that is interested in doing the scene, then perhaps the rest of the group could be left out so they don't mess it up?<br><br>Fundamentally my choice in this kind of situation would be to try it out, then stop once it becomes obvious that the group isn't on the same wavelength. Go back to boardgaming afterwards, and not spend too much energy with basically trying to play a roleplaying game while dodging the core of the game. If you can't, then you can't, and it's sad and all, but not something that can be fixed by changing the rules of the game. Meanwhile it makes sense to try different games now and again in the hopes that the people in question grow towards creative compatibility, or the right game happens along.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374150/#Comment_374150" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T16:27:24+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  4:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with the "try playing it before you hack it" crowd.

The direct interaction of role-playing balances the stand-alone (and scary!) authority of history creation. Without that interaction it could be a lot easier for players to feel like they're just making stuff by themselves, like your one player did. Role-playing is also a nice break from the hot seat: you get to relax and play at your own pace, which I think is pretty critical.<br/><br/>To me role-played scenes are the pay dirt that all the history making sets up. The unchoreographed things that happen in role-play spark players to go in whole new directions when they make their own history.<br/><br/>Daniel, you mentioned that the Focus didn't keep your one player from making things unrelated to everyone else. I'm guessing these were very broad Focuses like war, space travel, etc? Tight Foci like "the terrorist attack on Pharsus IV" (or even tighter "Jak Dorin, the terrorist behind the bombing on Pharsus IV") are always better, I think, because they make players create stuff that clearly interrelates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390719/#Comment_390719" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T14:32:19+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  2:32PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Ben, thanks for your thoughts.<br/><br/>The challenge with this group is that there's a couple that really aren't storygamers, and one fellow - "B" - is by nature a contrarian.  This has caused problems before when I've tried to run more trad rpgs with this group, and in this case I think it was entirely a matter of personality and not the game mechanics.  The Foci were reasonably tight, and I did try to set them up that way on my turn, but there was only so much that could be done.  He wanted to do Spelljammer and that was pretty much the end of it.<br/><br/>You're right on the removing roleplaying, but again this group is not a set of people I'd be inclined to try storygaming with.  It's one of the reasons we've settled on mostly boardgaming, since that minimizes the conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
