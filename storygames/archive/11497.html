Only, most of the people there can't do magic - they lost that power long ago. And so you're too useful to let slip, and the various adults and their various factions scramble to recruit you to their causes. Because a war is brewing, and the times are not what they used to be. Heart of Ashes is a roleplaying game about adventure, danger and making hard decisions. It's also a game about kids and adults.<br/><br/>Inspired by: Pan's Labyrinth, Coraline, Harry Potter, Ink, Through the Looking Glass, The City of Lost Children, His Dark Materials, Disney's Robin Hood.<br/><br/>Anyways, I have an artist who's hella enthusiastic on working on the project with me.<br/>I have put together a pretty detailed style guide, and wanted to share it with all of you: <a href="http://joepub.fileave.com/Heart%20of%20Ashes%20SG.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://joepub.fileave.com/Heart%20of%20Ashes%20SG.pdf</a><br/><br/>I don't know how to write/compose style guides, and I didn't really research it, I just made some assumptions about what was necessary and included that.<br/>So! If you want to criticize what I've included or omitted, please do so.<br/>If you want to suggest other artists/pieces that I might want to include later on, please do so.<br/>If you want to ask questions about the game, please do so!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256204/#Comment_256204" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T14:58:42+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  2:58PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this!

His name is Devan Dirocco. He used to be my roommate, and his work is fantastic. Furthermore, he's pumped on the project and initially wanted to do all the illustrative work absolutely free. I've been negotiating him <i>up</i> from his starting offer ever since, but we're still pretty firmly stuck at "maybe I'll take some compensation, we'll see." So, dream artist is check.<br/><br/>2.) Your stuff is cool, and totally in line with the Heart of Ashes vibe. If Devan gets assassinated in the next month or two, I'll contact you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256278/#Comment_256278" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T05:42:50+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  5:42AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see no Henry Darger there - The Story of the Vivian Girls sounds close to your description.
