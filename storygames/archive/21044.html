Since I'm playing Monsterhearts in a couple of days, it gets the same treatment.<br/><br/>It's basically a first draft; I expect many revisions. But I think Monsterhearts needs a more interesting take on harm than good old hit points, so here's a basic adaptation of my AW harm rules to Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>The basic gist is: <i>you hurt someone to make them lose control over their destiny</i>.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b><i>When you suffer bodily harm</i></b>, roll. For each statement that is true (below), take +1 to your roll.<br/><br/>* "It's not serious: they're not really trying to cause me <i>lasting</i> harm."<br/>* "It's not frightening: they're not bigger, heavily armed, or more numerous than me."<br/><br/><i>-If you're not sure if "they" are trying to cause you lasting harm, ask them. <br/>-"It" could be an object or a place, if, say, you've just crashed your car.<br/></i><br/><b>On a 10+</b>, choose one from the list below.<br/><b>On a 7-9</b>, choose two, or ask your opponent to choose one.<br/><b>On a miss</b>, you choose one, and your opponent chooses one.<br/><br/>Mark your choices. You can only choose each option once. If you come back from apparent death, clear them all.<br/><br/>The MC or other players can narrow your choice. Don't choose an option which doesn't follow believably from your actions or the situation. If "you're dead" was chosen, the second choice might come into play before, during, or after your death: for instance, you might flee, only to bleed out and die in the woods.<br/><br/><b>O</b> You are scared and shaken - give a String to your attacker.<br/><b>O</b> You look weak - lose a String on your attacker, and take a Condition.<br/><b>O</b> You're a bloody mess. This will probably leave serious scars.<br/><b>O</b> You freeze up or you panic and flee (your choice).<br/><b>O</b> You're knocked flat on your face: dazed, senseless, you hardly know where you are.<br/><b>O</b> It's bad: you're going to need medical help.<br/><b>O</b> Afterwards, you have no clear memory of what happened or misremember important details.<br/><b>O</b> You're dead.<br/><br/>Healing:<br/><br/>At the beginning of a new session, clear any and all choices which don't seem to be still relevant.<br/><br/>Otherwise, spending time with someone in an intimate context (being vulnerable to them) can allow you to clear one. Ask them what they're doing for you, and which choice that might allow you to clear. (Again, follow fictional logic here: if they have some weird way of restoring your memory or bringing you back to life, then that's an option. Otherwise, probably all they can do is remove a Condition or get you cleaned up so you don't look like hell anymore. A medical professional can supply medical help, of course, in the same way.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461738/#Comment_461738" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T22:19:45+00:00" title="April  5, 2017 10:19PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2017 10:58PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one more thing:<br/><br/>If your opponent choose to deal extra harm (on a 10+ roll to "lash out"), make your roll at -2.<br/><br/>Or perhaps "choose an additional option" would be better.

I think we have very similar views on gaming and "immersion".<br/><br/><br/>More notes on this attempt at a hack:<br/><br/>* You can spend Strings to make someone roll this move at -1, as with any other move.<br/><br/>* If you have some really hardcore violence in your game (guns, butchery), prepare yourself for one of two things:<br/><br/>1. These teens are going to be incredibly resilient to physical harm, action movie style. (This is already the case in default Monsterhearts; no change there. It's appropriate to the genre.) <br/><br/>or<br/><br/>2. Get used to describing truly horrible harm in fairly vague terms before you make this move, so you have room to re-imagine a gunshot wound as getting winged by a bullet, for instance. (I suppose those often happens in default Monsterhearts, as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461790/#Comment_461790" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-08T03:16:24+00:00" title="April  8, 2017  3:16AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2017 9:02PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another note:<br/><br/>If a move indicates for you to take 1-harm, and there is no obvious fictional sense for it, it becomes a -1ongoing to the harm move.

I like it, mostly, but things like getting a String for harming someone starts to step on the toes of specific playbooks (for example, one of the Werewolf moves is exactly 'when you harm someone, get a String on them.') A lot of these things are, descriptively, stuff that happens already when violence occurs in games of Monsterhearts I've played -- but having a specific list could certainly operate as a nice reminder to people, and as long as the mechanical effects remain straightforward enough it seems fine.<br/><br/>Some options make more or less sense to only be choosable once, though -- for something like 'you're a bloody mess' it makes sense, but for getting strings or freezing up, much less so. I understand the desire to retain some of the HP-track feel, though.<br/><br/>It also seems to make it much easier to kill someone, if you want to kill them, which is not necessarily a problem but makes your statement about action movie resilience seem strange to me -- are you just assuming nobody would ever be so gauche as to choose 'You're dead' from the list until it was nearly the last option? As the rules stand, a miss is lethal if it makes sense in the fiction. So regular harm can kill someone like... 40% of the time, assuming it is not unreasonable in the fiction. Someone choosing to cause great harm ups that to 70%. As I said, this doesn't necessarily seem like a critical flaw, but I'm curious about how you see that working -- or how it has worked so far. (I am guessing: nobody has even considered choosing it for somebody else.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463259/#Comment_463259" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-11T12:25:17+00:00" title="May 11, 2017 12:25PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, as a random note, in the new edition Conditions are exclusively social labels.

I don't think it would be a disaster if occasionally a Werewolf with Primal Dominance could score <i>two</i> Strings by harming someone. We'll have to play with it some more, of course, to see if there are other undesirable effects, but so far it feels good.<br/><br/>You're quite right about it being easy to kill someone, but consider that, in default Monsterhearts, you can do so automatically by hitting them with harm and spending a few Strings.<br/><br/>My thinking is that the choices made must respect the fiction - if it doesn't seem believable that the action could kill a character, then the group should veto that option. I think that should be sufficient for most purposes (other choices in the game operate this way already, at least in the way that we play with the moves).<br/><br/>The reason I say it's "non-lethal" is that, unlike hit point rules, it's possible for someone to take a lot of harm without dying. You could now get shot four or five times in a row and conceivably survive, for example. I don't know yet if this will be a problem or not; again, for the time being I'm expecting the players to collaborate on choosing options appropriate to the situation.<br/><br/>About the new edition:<br/><br/>Where are people getting all this information about rules changes and the new edition?

Basically everyone had one health left, and several were already in their darkest selves.<br/><br/>The group was avoiding Lashing Out at people who were in their Darkest Self, I beleive out of politeness, because nobody wanted to force someone into death (and, generally, a new skin - we tend to prefer to keep the character's story going, but in a new skin, rather than introduce a new protagonist.  We have a Queen who has become an undead-themed Hollow, for example.  It nicely represents big changes that teens go through.  The Dark Power is basically the avenue by which this has been happening in the fiction - we seem to have arrived at the same idea!).  I beleive this holding back was meant to be considerate of fellow players, but it made the scene a bit odd and enervating.<br/><br/>I've since reviewed, and recalled that you can loose all your strings on people to recover, but had forgotten this at the time.  It also wouldn't be much of a shift for this group, as they tend to forget string use (which itself is something I've tried to encourage).<br/><br/>But I think part of the issue is that people don't want to force each other to change their character theming (via their skin) against their will.  So I was thinking about introducing a kind-of death-lite, where a character's sex move or darkest self shifts to something new, but the character stays in the same skin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465991/#Comment_465991" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-30T20:04:26+00:00" title="August 30, 2017  8:04PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting! It's always seemed to me that Monsterhearts death is already far too "weak sauce". Hard to imagine a group trying to take away its teeth.<br/><br/>All the house rules I've seen for Monsterhearts are to make death more impactful.<br/><br/>That said, why are they fighting in the first place? Perhaps you could introduce a rule for attacking someone with 0-harm (to subdue or knock out or push out of the way). Or a rule where taking someone to 4-harm allows you the option to dominate them instead of killing them.<br/><br/>It all seems a bit silly to me, though. Monsterhearts is all about messy sexy, drama, and personal violence, isn't it? People die in these stories all the time; it's an important part of the genre.<br/><br/>Or maybe you need a softer Darkest Self rule? <br/><br/>Really, it's the escape clause that's meaningful here. Surely the PCs would at the very least desired recenege against whoever killed them? That seems Darkest Self enough already.<br/><br/>If they could escape from it fairly quickly, that would soften it significantly.<br/><br/>All working together to make that situation come about fairly fast might do a lot of the work for you.<br/><br/>In my current campaign players are usually disappointed by how HARD it is to get into your Darkest Self. They're trying but it's not easy to do! The Mortal is now planning to sleep with as many PCs as possible, just for the opportunity to turn people into their Darkest Selves.<br/><br/>If your characters are goody-two-shoes, and going Darkest Self would "ruin them" as characters, I'd be tempted to say you might not be playing the right game.<br/><br/>When I play, I get all the players to read their Darkest Self description and tell them that if they don't feel excited to play it out, they should pick a different Skin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466001/#Comment_466001" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-31T03:18:40+00:00" title="August 31, 2017  3:18AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hard to get into Darkest Self?

I may have belaboured that simile a bit, but the point is that killing <br/> doesn't really solve a problem.<br/><br/>I think I'd argue that this also lets the players play a little harder under most circumstances.  We tend to get very close to our characters in our games, encourage bleed, self-discovery, and provoke emotions.  Ensuring that your character's story doesn't abruptly end is important to that end; people need certain safeties to explore emotions, I think.<br/><br/>And yes, absolutely, people die in these stories all the time!  However, the in-genre media that I've consumed tends to have it that the lead cast of the show/book always survive (if you consider undeath surviving), while it's the supporting cast members who  have a pretty high attrition rate.    Awful, awful stuff happens to the main cast, but death generally doesn't let them off the hook from it.<br/><br/>Take BuffyTVS for example.  The core cast of Buffy, Xander, Willow and Giles is always in the show.  When people die (as Buffy is prone towards), they change skins.  When Buffy dies at the end of season 5, she definitely comes back as a different skin.<br/><br/>But supporting characters (such as Tara) who die, tend to serve another character's plotline by their death (in this case, Willow).  Similarly, in our game, character's NPC classmates and teachers are always outside the bubble, and won't come back, but the people who care about them get pissed.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm over-illustrating my point, though.  But this mode works for us, anyway.  <br/>  In any case, NPCs drop like flies and anytime someone is in their darkest selves, and people generally play hard.  They just don't want to push anyone out of their character unwillingly.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes, I'm thinking that reframing what happens when you take a 4th harm away from "death" might help.  Dominated is an interesting idea.  Maybe if I just reframe it as a move, where death is just one choice on a list would work:<br/><br/>When you take a 4th harm, you are critically injured.  You can feel your perceptions narrowing on survival, and death closes in.  Choose:<br/>o You become your darkest self<br/>o You lose your strings on everyone else.<br/>o You are dominated, and promise to do anything.  The character who dealt the 4th harm extracts a promise from you, in exchange for your pathetic life.  If you don't doggedly persue it, they either return and finish the job, or your injuries re-open and finish you.<br/>o You sucumb or appear to sucumb to your injuries, but return as Something Else<br/>o You succumb to your injuries and pass from the narrative<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">@Lisa Padol</a>  I don't believe you can just choose to (though... I can't see any reason you couldn't just act like you are in it), but it is definitely easy.  Any time the GM takes a hard move, Darkest Self is on the list of options.  If I want to be in my Darkest Self, I usually just ask.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466016/#Comment_466016" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-01T16:59:45+00:00" title="September  1, 2017  4:59PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I've found this hack to address this pretty well. No one is ever killed "by accident" (just because someone wanted to lash out and they were "out of hit points", in other words). It's always a player choice. (And the usual options of losing your Strings or going Darkest Self are there if it's ever one-sided).<br/><br/>In our game, the Witch found yet another alternative, which was to take the Ghoul's move "Short Rest for the Wicked" at the moment of his death. This means that, yes, he died, but he's coming back - without going Darkest Self.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466018/#Comment_466018" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-01T22:22:33+00:00" title="September  1, 2017 10:22PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worth thinking about, cool.
