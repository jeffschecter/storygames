My players were a generic D&amp;D-type wizard, a more nature-themed hedge mage, and a sneaky rogue (the rogue, by the way, had an ability called 'Know stuff you shouldn't know', which proved to be extremely useful). The setting: an isolated village in a land on the verge of chaos.<br/><br/>Here's a brief rundown of the game. You can skip all this and go right to the postmortem analysis, if you like.<br/><br/>* The mayor of the village approached the adventurers and told them that his daughter had been kidnapped by a gang of teenage cultist neophytes.<br/>* The adventurers arrived at a ruined castle, which was surrounded by a moat which I described as 'rather nasty-looking'.<br/>* The wizard looked around for a bird to scout out the area, failed his check, and I decided to state as a fact that he found two birds anyway, both hostile.<br/>* Meanwhile, the rogue's player narrated in (using the Law of Successes) a very large and partially-blind crocodile coming out of the moat.<br/>* During the ensuing combat, the rogue (who now, after a succeeded knowledge check, knew Reptilian), bluffed the crocodile into joining them, and the wizard did the same thing with a spell. I ruled here that successes on the bluff/charm check would let the characters give one command to the creature, one success each.<br/>* After that fight, a water elemental appeared from the moat, but it was quickly dispatched by the hedge mage overchannelling and magically throwing a lot of clods of earth at it. (This was the only fight of the game in which the crocodile participated on the players's side, and it wasn't any help at all even then.)<br/>* The rogue then went inside the castle by himself, and found a statue of an incomprehensible cthulic figure inside (using the Law of Successes rule). He used 'Know stuff you shouldn't know' on it and failed the check. I stated that a flood of forbidden knowledge flooded his brain and that he had to go and attack the next creatures he sees until either one of them is incapacitated. (Which was a stupid thing for me to do, in retrospect, but it led to interesting consequences.)<br/>* The first character the rogue saw was the hedge mage, and dutifully attacked him. The fight then proceeded to be a whole lot of nothing, since the wizard's player went awol (I narrated this as the wizard suddenly disappearing with a loud 'Wop'), and the mage decided not to directly attack or even try to incapacitate the rogue.<br/>* After nearly a full flurry of nothing significant happening in the fight, the rogue went back to the statue to replan his next attack, touched the statue, and stated (as 2 facts) that he is teleported to another room, where he found a cultist sacrificing a maiden (2 facts), and the cultist was actually his grandmother. She quickly became hostile to her grandson.<br/>* The hedge mage found a trapdoor and fell into the same room at about this time. Three teenage cultists rushed into the room as well, and the Cthulic figure depicted in the statue also began materializing in it. (At this point I kind of let the whole 'rogue must attack hedge mage' thing slide, because there were bigger problems to deal with and I didn't want the PCs to be totally overwhelmed.)<br/>* The rogue then realized that the teenagers were actually his brothers, and that they all used to have the Cthulic aberration over for tea (Law of Successes).<br/>* There was a massive and complicated fight, in which I wasn't at all sure what was going to happen, and it ended with the grandmother being trapped in the earth for the rest of eternity, the teenagers either dead or escaped, and the Cthulic aberration disappearing.<br/>* Suddenly, the wizard popped back into existence out of nowhere (as an NPC), looking ragged and mostly insane. He warned his party-mates that the aberraton was merely going to fetch his daddy and was going to come back, and began running for his life along with the rogue. The hedge mage quickly made a magical and reality-destroying bomb. The abberation's daddy materialized, and the hedge mage activated the bomb, destroying himself and the abberation. Fade to black.<br/><br/><br/>Things that could have gone better:<br/>* The players never really thought of using (or had a chance to use) most of their equipment. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to bring most of it into play one way or another.<br/>* The rogue's cloak actually came into play with a curse die, which I completely forgot to use. That was kind of a missed opportunity for me.<br/>* It took me a long while to realize that gathering magic power has to happen on different turns than actually discharging the spell.<br/>* It took me still longer to sort out the rules on ties in a resolution roll: a roll of 20, 17, 5 actually gets only one success against 17, 10, not two.<br/>* It sucked to lose two players over the course of the game.<br/>* I should have thought out the whole insanity thing a little bit better. In retrospect, it should only have lasted a couple rounds.<br/>* The players didn't get a chance to loot their enemies' corpses.<br/>* Combat was sometimes rather confusing and muddled.<br/>* Not least, the rogue's player was disappointed about his character not being terribly useful in combat. This proved not to be too much of a problem, though, just because he was such a ridiculously creative player, and came up with ways to affect the game no matter what.<br/><br/>What was awesome:<br/>* Donjon ROCKS in a play-by-post setting! Thing is, the GM advice given in the rules is kind of just a lesser version of 'Schrodinger's railroading'. You write up a bunch of stats and encounters, and inconspicuously steer the game towards them (there's all sorts of leeway the player gets in this process, but you're going to hit most of the encounters the GM prepped, no matter what). Which makes sense, because otherwise you'd have to halt play to make a bunch of statblocks every time a player introduces a character. PbP, however, eliminates the need to halt play. Which means that the DM can basically just wing it as long as he has a vague idea of how things are probably going to end up.  So, you ditch Schrodinger and prep totally out the window, and keep the game 100% pure improvised acid-jam rock. Just as God and Nixon intended.<br/>* Even though the rogue was severely underpowered, the Law of Successes kind of made that optimization disparity irrelevant.<br/>* The Law of Successes was every bit as brilliant and fun as it seems. The players didn't get terribly creative about using it in attack roll results (most of the successes they got during attack rolls went straight to the damage test), but overall it added a lot of interest to the game.<br/>* The whole plot-twist at the end where the cultist lady was actually the rogue's grandma, and the teenagers were his brothers, and they all used to have the abberation over for tea was absolutely hilarious. It also added a lot of uncertainty to the fight. At first I thought they might kill or charm the hedge mage and then have a tea party again.<br/>* The whole Lovecraft theme was totally unintended on my part and sort of naturally flowed from the stated facts, so that was cool.<br/>* The climatic fight scene at the end was chaotic (in a fun way) and very cinematic.<br/>* The ending was really satisfying, though it probably wouldn't have happened had the rogue's player not been commandeering the hedge mage.<br/>* The game was very tactically interesting throughout.<br/>* Donjon is easily my favorite system ever. Even ignoring the acid-jam-rock-y-ness of the Law of Successes, the fact that it's a gamist system in which any character concept (from janitor to evil mecha robot) is equally powerful, yet which retains a D&amp;D 3.X-like amount of tactical complexity makes it pretty darn awesome in my books. Add to that the fact that the players get to sculpt the game to their tastes, and you have a bundle of fun of almost nuclear proportions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421455/#Comment_421455" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-13T06:32:02+00:00" title="September 13, 2013  6:32AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat.  I love the <i>idea</i> of Donjon.  I've played maybe half a dozen times and maybe a third of them were downright fun.  And when they were, they were downright delightful!  The other two thirds were sort of painfully slow.  I'd love to perfect the skills that make it fun all the time but I haven't even figured out what those are and what I need to work on.  I've played quite a bit of PBP and my first guess would have been that the things that make it slow at the table would make it deadly slow by post -- like simple combats taking a month to resolve and stuff.  Is that not so?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RushWright" title="RushWright"><img alt="RushWright" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RushWright">RushWright</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421469/#Comment_421469" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-13T12:51:13+00:00" title="September 13, 2013 12:51PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [excuse the very unstructured and incoherent nature of the coming post, I wrote it quickly]<br/><br/>Well, maybe it helped that my players (and I) were fairly active, but we got through basically an entire session (4 combats, one of which was very book-keeping-intensive) in three months... and that was including several lengthy breaks in the second half of the game, when we were all waiting for the players who vanished from the game. I don't know where you draw the line between 'slow' and 'not-slow', but I didn't feel it dull or slow at any point during the game.<br/><br/>I think maybe it's because Donjon has a much more dense play structure compared to, say, D&amp;D. A typical D&amp;D combat might go like this:<br/>Player: Thog moves up to square A6 and looks around the corner.<br/>DM: He sees a corridor going on for 60'. There's a goblin standing 20' from Thog down the corridor, and it looks very angry.<br/>Player: Thog attacks the goblin. *roll*<br/>DM: That's a hit. Roll damage.<br/>Player: *rolls*<br/>DM: Okay, the goblin is wounded but not quite dead. It...<br/><br/>And so on and so forth. The equivalent in Donjon would take roughly the same amount of posts:<br/>Player: Thog looks around the corner. *discernment check* 1 success. Okay, he sees a goblin about 20 feet away from him.<br/>DM: [narrates the goblin into play]<br/>Player: For my next action, Thog attacks the goblin. *attack roll* 3 successes. Okay, I disarm him and keep the other two dice for my damage roll. *damage test* Four damage. I'll use them all to lower his Adroitness.<br/>DM: [narrates the goblin's being and hurt]<br/><br/>The combats aren't longer, either, because though a flurry involves several times more actions than a D&amp;D combat round, there are less of them. I think the only combat that even made it to the second flurry was the final one, and that was just because it involved 2 PCs against 2 bosses and 3 minions.<br/><br/>So, post-for-post, Donjon doesn't take longer to play than D&amp;D does. The difference is (which, I think, is your problem), it's denser. The very resolution system takes longer to put into practice, the whole creativity-on-the-fly thing can be really tricky to put into practice, and there are far more decisions to make per action (what with choosing from a nearly limitless number of viable actions, deciding on facts, and so on). All these things contribute to slowing down a face-to-face game, but don't really have any serious effect on a PbP game (because you're generally waiting at least an hour for everybody else's posts, anyway). In fact, the density actually makes PbP Donjon more fun, because there is so much more room for strategy and thought you can pour into everything you do.<br/><br/>To sum up:<br/>* Donjon and D&amp;D take roughly the same amount of posts to get something (whether a simple test, an action, or a full combat) done, so they take about the same amount of time in a PbP setting.<br/>* However, a Donjon game will take longer Face-to-Face than PbP.<br/>* Donjon is more dense (in terms of decision trees) than D&amp;D, so it's far more exciting to play through a PbP Donjon combat than a D&amp;D one.<br/><br/>All in all, give me Play-by-Post Donjon over Face-to-Face Donjon or Play-by-Post D&amp;D. Any day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
