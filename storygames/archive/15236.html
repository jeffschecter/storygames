Now you're all out of your turkey-addled have over Christmas, it's time to look forward to all the great gaming in the year to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few games listed on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games page</a>, all by the indefatigable James Mullen:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>The Final Voyage of The Selene</b><br/>\n<br/>\nA guided-narrative freeform telling the story of a disaster in space, but the story begins with the The Selene leaving the frontier of explored space, heading for Earth, and the disaster doesn't happen until almost the end of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>In Camera</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a game that's meant to capture the style &amp; tone of films likes The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity and Apollo 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first two rounds of play, everyone creates cameras, using them to introduce locations or characters that will appear frequently in the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn subsequent rounds of play, each player can direct an event: during this, a deck of cards is used to pace the event, with red cards equating to light or positive situations and black cards equating to dark or negative ones. The director of the scene has a small hand of cards to hand out to the other players, facing their characters with an appropriate situation as he does so, but the director can make use of the cameras in the scene to 'edit' the footage with cuts, pans and zooms, changing the cards he has and therefore the situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a reciprocal process in action, in that players decide how their characters respond to the situation they are dealt and this decision feeds back into the cards that are available in later events, weighting them towards light or dark content.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>It's Not Paranoia If They're Really Out to Get You</b><br/>\n<br/>\nA reverse-hack of the well-known Paranoia RPG, this is a super-rules light version of the game, where players only ever roll two types of dice: Hazard &amp; Treason.<br/>\nRoll Hazard when you follow orders, use skills, operate tools, live up to the ideals of your Service Group, display loyalty or heroism and ask the Computer for aid or guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoll Treason when you use forbidden knowledge, disobey orders, possess contraband, live up to the ideals of your Secret Society, use your Mutant Power or openly exhibit treachery and betrayal of your fellow Troubleshooters.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot Sixes? You succeed! Rolled a set? Sh*t happens!</div>\n</blockquote>\nBut that's only three games. We want more! If you have a game you're thinking of running, let us know and we'll add it to the website.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook forward to seeing you all in March!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355938/#Comment_355938" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T13:28:49+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  1:28PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some updates from Concrete Cow central.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst is that I'm pleased to welcome <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.reapersrevenge.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Reaper's Revenge</a> back to Concrete Cow! Bob will be there with his buckets of shiny dice, previously-loved games, and other gaming paraphernalia.

One is Grim's Gangs, Bob's own RPG. The other is a playtest of another small-press RPG, Mirror of the Soul: Panthea. The blurb is:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Panthea">Panthea</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Set in an Fantasy-themed world with Magic and Antropomorphic races. The game-world is rich in politics and turmoil to suit all parties, with multiple factions and a deep and unique history that has evolved from direct player interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system moves away from the old "Golden Rule" of "If the ST doesn't like the rule, change it" to "If the player can blag it, then they can try it." This has produced some 'interesting' results like a sword being deflected by a smile... no, seriously... a smile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scenario starts with a simple job offer you can't refuse, but the unfolding of events depends greatly on player choice.</div>\n</blockquote>\nBut we need more games!

It can be as broad as the rise and fall of a millennias old starfaring society or narrow as the short and bloody reign of a mad Goblin king. The genre is chosen at the start and you pick things to add in or exclude to make it slightly more interesting and drive you away from cliche.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no 'characters', you will pick up people at these great moments and most likely discard them for the next.
