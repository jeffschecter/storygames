I may find out that it matters.<br/><br/>I love games where Social conflicts can end up changing my character's mind or make me fall in love and I love having it apply to NPCs and PCs alike. It takes me to new places and makes Social skills meaningful.<br/><br/>However, I recently ran a con session of TSOY and one player expressed a particular disinterest in anything affecting his character under the skin. We shifted gears with the game and still had a decent session. There was an honest discussion of mixed expectations right there at the situation and we were able to work things out.<br/><br/>I wonder, though, for those individuals who have problems with this dissonance between rules affecting physics vs. the mind, if they could be brought to more fun (as I imagine it above) if it were ran a little differently.<br/><br/>What if, when a Social Conflict was taking place that involved the changing of a character's mind (both PC and NPC) in some fashion, the goal was to have a Key given to the character?<br/><br/>Instead of Stakes: (Will she love me?) it could be Stakes: (Will she now have the Key of Love?) Then, the player could choose to act on these impulses and be rewarded for it. Even tastier, betrayal could be met with a Key buy-off.<br/><br/>I'm weak when it comes to Social Contract issues. I expect there to be some concern about that. I'm just wondering that if it were presented in this new light, could anyone see problems with it?<br/><br/>I'll go ahead and state one: You haven't really won anything if the PC or NPC chooses not to cash in on the Key. If only you could compel Keys like Aspects in Fate!<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63683/#Comment_63683" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T11:37:00+00:00" title="April 12, 2007 11:37AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think rewarding the player for having his character do things that his character is "compelled" to do (but can resist) is a good thing.<br/><br/>This allows the player to say, "Yes, he loves this person, but he loves his country more, so he'll kill her, much as it pains him, when it's the only way to save his king."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63684/#Comment_63684" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T11:47:20+00:00" title="April 12, 2007 11:47AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what if the Stakes are (Do you get the Key of Vengeance against the Princess?) and the player on the other end of the stakes is dissatisfied completely with that situation?

Characters use verbal attacks and maneuvers to overpower and destroy their opponents\xe2\u20ac\u2122 arguments and make themselves appear, to all witnesses, correct.<br/><br/>The Duel of Wits is designed to simulate debate and argument: A speaker convinces an audience of the merits of his point. It is not designed to change a single character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s or player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s opinion. While this is possible, of course, it is not the goal.<br/><br/>[snip]<br/><br/>Neither of the performing characters\xe2\u20ac\u2122 opinions has been changed by the<br/>event, but the audience thinks that clown is the cat\xe2\u20ac\u2122s meow\xe2\u20ac\u201dbecause,<br/>for them, his performance was better.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>Thus, Duel of Wits just complicates any issue I would have with bringing about the fun that is having your character's mindset changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63740/#Comment_63740" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T17:00:47+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  5:00PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what Andrew's talking about goes like this:<br/><br/>Instead of "I change your mind," I can frame the conflict as "I get you to concede."

You can chose at any time to have a Key Damaged or Toggled or Grayed Out or what-have-you instead of taking Harm.

When you are defeated in a conflict that has gone to bringing down the pain the consequences can attack your Keys. This can either happen from being destroyed or from giving when the consequences are on the table. <br/><br/>2. You can have a Key "shut off" -- in this case the key no longer gives you Xp. You can turn the Key back on by winning a conflict appropriate to rejuvenating the key. (Such as losing the Key of Love when you become convinced your lover is cheating on you, but regaining it after having a conflict in which you learn that she was set up.) Note: Should the PC be able to buy off the key and still get XP? -- possibly, as that means the other was ultimately successful in permanently destroying the key. Note 2: Is it possible to target only specific parts of a key for shut off? Like, target only the buy off option? Or target only the mid level option? That might be interesting. <br/><br/>3. You can have a new key placed upon you. This key is as a normal key but doesn't cost you XP to buy and it does not have a buy off condition. To gain a buy off condition you must win a conflict in which you have stakes and situation fitting to moving towards your character learning to let go. (For example if you are seduced and gain the key of love, but later you win a conflict and catch the person that seduced you setting you up to be killed, you gain the ability to buy off.) Note that this does not force you to act in accord with the new key -- you may, for example, kill the man that seduced you even though you love him. It just rewards you if you chose to follow along with it. <br/><br/>4. You can have a key transmuted. In this case you have one key replaced with another, for example the Key of Love being replaced with the Key of Unrequited Love if someone wins a contest against you and takes your lover. You can then use that key as normal (including buy off), or you can transmute it back by winning a fitting conflict in the future. <br/><br/>In general conflicts to change, remove, or unfreeze keys should not have so simple and direct of stakes as "I want to end my fear of snakes now." It should play out in a dramatic fashion and have real risk to the character if it fails. Some keys may be harder to shake than others, and may require some creativity to get rid of. In all cases keys can only be modded in Bringing Down the Pain, not in a normal contest.<br/><br/>Option: A normal contest can modify a Key for a scene, but not permanently. <br/><br/>PCs can do this to NPCs too. Minor NPCs may be able to be modded without BDtP, but named NPCs can only be modded permanently in BDtP, just as they can only be killed in BDtP. <br/><br/>Note: Keys from conflicts only come from the result of real conflicts. You can't conflict yourself to get a free key. If the group thinks someone is trying to get a free key they have the right to instantly change the consequences to something nastier. <br/><br/>Note 2: You can have keys shut off, but you can't just lose one off your sheet forever.<br/><br/>For Tribe 8 TSOY, this kind of thing is the perfect option for Synthesis based Secrets. Either only those with a secret can do this (such as Magdalites using Lust to give someone the Key of Lust), or the secrets give a weapon bonus (up to +3) for conflicts in which the consequences involve giving another character a key. Other Secrets (like Joanite Devotion) could give armor (same value) to resist having your keys messed with.<br/><br/><br/>P.S. Yes, I talk to myself when I make notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63929/#Comment_63929" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-14T19:35:48+00:00" title="April 14, 2007  7:35PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Secret Arts in Weapons of the Gods work in a somewhat similar way: you can't force someone to act like they're in love... but you can give them penalties if they don't, or, alternatively, bonuses if they do.

Thanks Alex!<br/><br/>I pretty much thought you had to have an audience to until I played a session of BW with Luke, Thor and Ralph (I think) at GenCon in 2005.  The 3 of us were trying to determine what was going to happen to a magical sword and we used the DoW.  There was no audience other than ourselves.  We were simply playing out an arguement and seeing who the system said would concede.  This works out okay in BW because the winner almost never completely gets his way.  He generally has to concede some things to the loser.  Thus, it doesn't resemble mind control but rather some sort of negotiated compromise.<br/><br/>You can do the same thing in BDtP.  If the loser inflicts damage on the winner during the argument then the winner has to concede some stuff to the loser at the end.  It isn't strickly by the rules, I don't guess, but I think it is within the spirit of the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64009/#Comment_64009" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T07:22:15+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  7:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas, Alex: Thanks. I'm awfully short-sighted some times.<br/><br/>Brand: Targeting just a portion of a Key means an in depth knowledge of Keys for the person wishing to strike it. I think that allowing the person to choose when a Key is damaged makes it easier as they're the possesor of the character sheet.<br/><br/>Andrew: I'm not sure if the current TSOY rules don't already match what you said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65647/#Comment_65647" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T05:45:37+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  5:45AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I had this all prepped to run last weekend.<br/><br/>And I didn't need it. I just made a huge effort to show how it should work and appeal to their sense of 'rule equality' (despite the hypocrisy of this in TSOY).<br/><br/>People loved it. One player used it to make up his character's mind between two tough choices. The other players used it to move on when an item was up for grabs.<br/><br/>However, I think the mechanic is still worth exploring in a more Cool Feature sense and not a Social Contract Patch sense.<br/><br/>Here are the character sheets that are prepped for use with this mechanic: <a href="http://tsoy.schtuff.com/" rel="nofollow">TSOY</a><br/><br/>So, how about this? At the beginning of BDtP, you can, along with your intentions, indicate which Keys are involved on your side. This gives you a Bonus Die per Key on the first roll of the dice. When being Harmed, the Harm inflictor can choose to not have the normal Harm inflicted but have it hit a Key. This Key would be impaired until the equivalent of a Refresh scene for that Key or Keys, as appropriate, were engaged in.<br/><br/>Yes?
