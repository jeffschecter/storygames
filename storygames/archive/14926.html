And some of them I just thought were kind of meh. I know it's not a matter of how well designed the games are, because some of those game that I didn't enjoy are getting accolades left and right. By now, I've played enough games that I kind of have an instinctual inkling of what kind of game I like and what kind of game I don't like. But I still can't put words on these types (and I have this gut feeling that I have basically one or two types I really like).<br/><br/>The way I see this, if I came into this subset of the gaming hobby right now and tried a single story game to see if I would keep on digging the body of games out there, it would basically be a coin toss. Pick a game I like, and I keep digging. But if I pick a game I don't, I'm done with story games with no inkling that this game has jackshit to do with that other game I was thinking of trying.<br/><br/>Someone needs to come up with a way to recommend games in a way that fit a person's tastes real fast, or I'm under the impression that story games will end up losing fans on that coin toss that they could've brought on board with a better "referral."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Fyans</cite>The same is true of Roleplay games, Boardgames, Wargames and Card games. Some you will like, some you won't; the only way to tell is by trial and experience. I fail to see why Story Games would be any different in this respect.</blockquote>\nSure, let's take boardgames for instance. I like a bit of everything, but my girlfriend hates worker placement and resource management games, and she likes tile placement, route/network building, set collection, and area control games. Without any kind of trial or experience with new game X, I can know that it's not a good purchase to play with my girlfriend if it features worker placement, or that it's likely to be a hit if it's about route building. Not only can I know that, but I have an established vocabulary to express my preferences or to seek information about a game I'm looking to buy.<br/><br/>This is the difference between story games and board games - story games lack that vocabulary, yet have grown diverse enough that having one would be really helpful to people with specific taste.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339400/#Comment_339400" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T07:06:32+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  7:06AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Montsegur 1244 is a GMless game with a fixed scene progression and rotating scene framing using some random inputs but freeform resolution.

Such a process has too much of the wrong kind of bias, both in the labels chosen and in what games they are applied to.<br/><br/>Instead, let data guide you. Example:<br/><br/>Suppose the existence of a web site containing a list of all games. People create an account. For each game, they say:<br/><br/>how often they've played the game (never, made characters but never used them, once, a few times, etc.)<br/>in what format they own the game (none, book, PDF, etc.)<br/>how enjoyable their typical play experience was, for some deliberately vague definition of "enjoyable" (hated it, meh, good, great, etc.)<br/><br/>Then, assuming everyone has rated every game they've played (which, of course, will clearly happen, since everyone <i>loves</i> data entry), you make recommendations to people based on how others with a similar rating profile to the user voted on a game.<br/><br/>Such a system contains quite a bit of knowledge, but it never requires any judgement about <i>why</i> the knowledge is that way, or even what the knowledge actually is. It doesn't know why anyone likes anything, it just assumes that if person A liked the same collection of games as person B, and A liked game X too, then it must have some nebulous quality that person B will probably like as well. It has no idea at all what that nebulous quality is.<br/><br/>Once such a system had a lot of rating data, you might be able to mine it all to figure out what these nebulous qualities are, but that's the end point, not the starting point.<br/><br/>This system has several kinds of bias, too. One is exactly the kind of bias you <i>want</i>: people's opinions on games. <br/><br/>Another type stems from the bias created by lack of data: the recommendations are only as good as the data it has. In real life, this would kill such a system, as it is extremely unlikely that a niche hobby like roleplaying would be able to generate a large enough data set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339405/#Comment_339405" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T07:28:38+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  7:28AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lester, doesn't RPG Geek approach that?

Certainly, it is a start. I suspect that RPG Geek is asking the wrong questions, though. Their rating system could really mean anything. Does <i>Eoris</i> get 7 out of 10 because people have fun playing it, or because it has great art and a funky setting? How many people who voted have even played it? If a game has crappy mechanics, but is somehow fun anyway, which people rate it high or low? <br/><br/>Lacking other data, it would probably do, but you'd have to change the notion of what the "recommendation" meant. It really couldn't mean "you will probably enjoy playing this game", but a more generic "you will probably enjoy the 'product experience' of this gaming product", whatever that means.<br/><br/>Also, even it's database is pretty sparse. There are only six ratings for <i>Happy Birthday, Robot</i>, for example. Even <i>Fiasco</i> only has ~70. So, like I mentioned, it's not clear that enough data could be collected to be meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339413/#Comment_339413" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T07:50:11+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  7:50AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random idea for a way to encourage at least some data collection in a system like this:<br/><br/>When you sign up, you are presented with a plea that says some variation of "this site only works if it collects lots of data" and then offers an <i>opt-in</i> "nagging" feature (which is fully explained and disclosed):<br/><br/>Once a day, everyone who has this feature on is asked (by e-mail, or any time they log in, or whatever) to rate the same game. They follow a link. This page shows them the "game of the day", plus up to three previous games of the day that they didn't vote on (maybe they were busy that day). They vote quickly and move on.<br/><br/>Importantly, if you have already voted for the game of the day, you are not nagged. (Minor incentive to vote for other games on your own.)<br/><br/>Assuming altruistic members, this sort of setup offers some advantages:<br/><br/>you get a lot of ratings for the same game at the same time.<br/>exposes members to games they may not know about.<br/>allows whoever runs the site to pick games that will best enhance the data set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339417/#Comment_339417" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T07:59:21+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  7:59AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This doesn't feel so much like a glossary issue as a review database issue.<br/><br/>If there are reviews available of the games then that's really helpful. I loved MLwM but didn't take to Dogs. Jargon won't help me with that, but reviews might. If a new game comes out and the review says "it borrows from the cool dice mechanic in Dogs but adds in an interesting extra stage" then I've no idea where that is on theory terms but I know that the dice mechanic was what I didn't like so I probably won't like this.<br/><br/>I'm not sure there's a huge need for defined terms. What's needed is capsule descriptions like this one Jason posted:<br/><br/>"Montsegur 1244 is a GMless game with a fixed scene progression and rotating scene framing using some random inputs but freeform resolution. The killer app is the combination of a detailed and perilous historical situation (Cathars!), a tight and fixed relationship map, and predetermined outcomes."<br/><br/>That tells me all I really need to know about Montsegur (apart from the setting which as it happens I do know but which is lacking in that description) and it tells me it fast. <br/><br/>Few things communicate faster than well written plain English.

The problem with most of these is that they treat a "document" as the center of the experience, while a system like this would need something more like a "database record" (with admin-defined fields) as the center. Some CMS can support that (Symphony does. Drupal, I think, has plugins that would allow it). I'd wager supporting tags is a simple as a plugin for most of them. The family tree stuff is harder, but some of the "closer to the metal" CMSs (e.g. MODx or Symphony) might have something that could work. On the other hand, some of them have <i>a lot</i> of plugins, so some might have some sort of relationship linking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339457/#Comment_339457" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T11:04:48+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 11:04AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the very least, it seems clear that more of us should add to RPGGeek.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339458/#Comment_339458" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T11:05:23+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 11:05AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2011 11:06AM by ivan.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Wordman">@Wordman</a>: I would estimate it to about 3 days of drupal work including installation on a server and some very basic styling.

What's needed is capsule descriptions like this one Jason posted:<br/><br/>"Montsegur 1244 is a GMless game with a fixed scene progression and rotating scene framing using some random inputs but freeform resolution. The killer app is the combination of a detailed and perilous historical situation (Cathars!), a tight and fixed relationship map, and predetermined outcomes."<br/><br/>That tells me all I really need to know about Montsegur (apart from the setting which as it happens I do know but which is lacking in that description) and it tells me it fast.<br/><br/>Few things communicate faster than well written plain English. A reviews database and friendly fora resolve this problem quite effectively.</blockquote>\nWait. You don't think those are "defined terms"? That 2 sentence example is almost all jargon, of exactly the sort that Jocelyn is talking about appreciating in board games.<br/><br/>"Montsegur 1244 is a GMless game - jargon, but reasonable<br/>with a fixed scene progression - very jargon<br/>and rotating scene framing - very very jargon<br/>using some random inputs - jargon, but reasonable<br/>but freeform resolution. - very very jargon <br/>The killer app is the combination of a detailed and perilous historical situation (Cathars!), - not jargon<br/>a tight and fixed relationship map, - jargon <br/>and predetermined outcomes." - jargon<br/><br/>The fact that it has a detailed and perilous historical situation is the only "plain English" descriptor in there.<br/><br/>That's not a criticism of Jason. I think Jason was trying to prove a point that we already have a pretty decent vocabulary for talking about games and the pieces that make up a design. Sure, more work can be done. But the innovative games from the past 10 years or so exist precisely because such jargon and the ideas behind them have been created and used.<br/><br/>In particular, more work can be done by designers in successfully telling potential players what their game is like and what it does well without the player needing to buy it to find out. But I think a lot of designers do a pretty reasonable job of doing that. <br/><br/>At least the ones who aren't semi-purposely obfuscating those things because they think they're game is for everyone and don't want to lose potential sales. Because many people don't understand that you gain more customers by accurately describing your product and it's niche than by falsely shotgunning your approach and trying to sell to EVERYONE.<br/><br/>I did some larp-focused work on this front, writing an article on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14484" rel="nofollow">Player Motives</a> and how event designers can satisfy them. Some of that vocabulary might be helpful as well. It is, in part, a way of getting much more granular than the 3-4 cagetory game descriptions (GNS etc.). But it's still working at the level of "types of things" rather than "actual things". (Jason's jargon is all "actual things".) But I think larp analysis tends to be at a slightly higher level, due to the greater challenge in organizing sessions, especially for large scale games. Still, those terms I developed are intended to do something very similar to what Jocelyn is asking for - to help people find games that suit their style, to help set expectations for players, to have fewer dissatisfying game experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339483/#Comment_339483" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T12:07:44+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 12:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Wordman">@Wordman</a>: I would estimate it to about 3 days of drupal work including installation on a server and some very basic styling.

I'm curious what that will look like.<br/>Honestly, I don't think I could. If I did, it would be a big long paragraph. Or a whole review. And frankly I don't know the game well enough to write it out in a longer form and add some more examples to clarify some of the terminology and make it less jargony.<br/><br/>I like your description. And I like the jargon. I think it's perfectly appropriate for what you were trying to say and the audience you're trying to say it to. It tells a person who knows what those terms are and who know what sort of games they like whether or not the game is likely to appeal to them.<br/><br/>Some of the stuff is, arguably, only jargon because of how succinctly you put it.<br/><br/>Fixed scene progression. My wife (who calls herself a non-gamer, but really she's more of a reluctant perma-newb) would read that and then reread it. And then she would scratch her head because she would not be sure she read it right. Then she would say "you mean, like, you go through the same scenes every time? How is that a roleplaying game? I thought you were supposed to make stuff up and follow where the players go like you do in the game you run?"<br/><br/>But if you said it over the course of 2-3 sentences instead of 3 words, she would say "Hmm. So that's a really different sort of game then, huh?"<br/><br/>Other parts, like freeform resolution, you would probably need to use some actual, specific examples in order for her to get what you were trying to say, because she's not familiar with different sorts of resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339553/#Comment_339553" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T16:54:18+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  4:54PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Building a database to make fuzzy connections based on user data only really works when you have nearly-passive input by users.<br/><br/>Netflix and Amazon have great systems for making recommendations for books and movies. Because they have thousands and thousands of users. And each of those thousands of users makes dozens or hundreds of transactions through their system. So they have assloads of data to work with.<br/><br/>And they still give me stuff that I say "Nope. Absolutely not. Not interested." on a regular basis. But they also make a lot of really good suggestions.<br/><br/>DriveThruRPG does a little of this. They track things that their users look at at the same time and make suggestions based on that to later users. And when I am browsing through their site for something, I see a lot of good, related suggestions that I often check out.<br/><br/>But mostly that helps with things like "I'm looking for paper terrain models and I want to see several by various companies before I pick ones I want." or "I'm going to run a Pathfinder game in an urban setting and I want to see lots of different idea books about that before I pick out a few to buy and read." It helps you find things that are very very similar like that.<br/><br/>But here's the thing. We're talking about indie games. Games that are distributed by many different methods. Many of them are only sold through individual websites. They don't all use the same distribution channel, so you can't use a shopping-based data collection model to data mine for them. And, to be honest, there's not enough reason for users to submit data if you're not talking about a shopping-based model.<br/><br/>If you got them all to use the same distribution channel, then you could do it.

First time I've played in a campaign since my son was born.<br/><br/>Here's my gaming table:<br/><br/>Ranyn. My 9 year old son. Loves tactical stuff to death. He's boffer larped at a couple of events and, for a 9 year old, is fairly good about taking his hits - which means you only have to remind him occasionally. This is his first time playing a tabletop game. He'd just plain struggle with the words. There's lots of big words in there.<br/><br/>Laura. My wife. Mid 30s. Considers herself "not a gamer". She's actively avoided roleplaying games for the 18 years we've been together, but knows a bit through osmosis. She just wouldn't really care about the 2 sentences and wouldn't bother trying to parse them.<br/><br/>Mallory. Mid 20s. A friend from larp. She's played D&amp;D and White Wolf and not much else, but has played them for years and years. And she's helped run larps. And she is also an aspiring novelist. But would never use a term like "scene framing" with regard to a roleplaying game, so she would struggle with that concept a lot. She sees RPG fiction as driven entirely through characterization and has never played a game that used authorial techniques. If she did, she'd probably resist for a long time because it would feel so different, but then eventually she'd totally dig it. But she hasn't gone through that process yet, so she'd get stuck there.<br/><br/>Kari. Mid 20s. Another friend from larp. Very much like Mallory, but she isn't an aspiring novelist. She's very proactive and a better system-head, so she tends to GM. Kind of a lot. In fact, I think the biggest thing she would struggle with was getting her head around the idea of a GMless game. I think she'd be so turned off by the time she got through those first few words that she would not even bother to read the rest. But not because she's an informed consumer who has tried GMless gaming and knows she doesn't like it. Just because she would have a hard time comprehend how and why you would do such a thing.<br/><br/>Jessica. Mid 20s. Another friend from larp. I think she used to play some WW back in the day, but I'm not sure. I know she has no D&amp;D experience unlike the other 20-somethings in the group. She came to larp via cosplay (and through dating Andrew). She's very curious and inquisitive, but doesn't have a lot of background to draw on. She would read the 2 sentences over and over again. She'd need someone to ask questions of about what some of the things meant and would need examples to comprehend them. But eventually she'd struggle through and comprehend it. And then she'd probably be intrigued and want to try it at least once and would keep her eye out for it if she were ever attending a convention or something.<br/><br/>Andrew. Mid 20s. Yet another friend from larp. He is the most "hardcore" gamer and rules monkey of the group. He's the only other one who has read the Savage Worlds rules that we're using a hack of. He used to do some freelance gamebook writing, but all of his experience has been with trad style games. He would read through the 2 sentences. And then reread them a few times to parse them, because they are quite dense. Then he would say "Huh. I've never played a game like that. Sounds neat. What's a relationship map? It sounds like it would be fun to try." And then he'd mostly forget about it and go back to thinking about the stuff he's more familiar with.<br/><br/>Aya. Mid 20s. Larp friend. I think the majority of her roleplay experience has been through freeform forum play. She's very dramatic. She's the type of person who will play in the same game for years and never really "get" the rules, she'll just get enough of them to passibly function. Cause she's not there for systems or structures or rules or procedures or any of that. She's there to be in character and to socialize. She'd read the 2 sentences and say "Yeah. Neat. I have no idea what that means." In fact, I can hear her voice saying exactly that.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>So out of the 8 of us (myself included) only 2 would be able to get through that description unaided without either giving up, not understanding, not caring, or needing lots of help clarifying and giving examples.<br/><br/>The average Story-Games.com poster is FAR FAR FAR from the average gamer, and I think many of the people here would need to reread those 2 sentences slowly and chew on them a bit in order to get at all the information densely packed in there. I know I did.<br/><br/>No, a non-gamer does not get "using some random inputs" when you put it like that. If you say "you use dice or playing card draws sometimes to randomize some parts of the game, which in other ways is quite heavily structured and static" then, yeah, a non-gamer would get it at that point. So some of it is, as I said, jargony looking because of how succinct it is.<br/><br/>Some of the stuff looks like jargon because it's the parts that challenge common assumption that people with only super trad-style experience would hold.<br/><br/>Like "predetermined outcomes". I consider that jargony because it's just so different. The only thing that is even remotely similar for the "average gamer" is the notion of "railroading", which is BAD. So why would anyone want to play a game that marked that as a feature? The concept needs to be unpacked and described with examples before it can be comprehended.<br/><br/>When you're describing something that people can relate to, you can be super succinct and you're fine.<br/><br/>When you're describing something that goes almost completely opposite of what they would normally assume to be good, then you need to spend a lot more time on your description in order to encourage comprehension.<br/><br/>In other words, story-games.com readers can read those 2 sentences easily because we've spent time thinking about those ideas before and considering them as at least possible options that some people might like.<br/><br/>Other folks who have spent over a decade getting used to vastly different assumptions that they've never really challenged before have a hard time comprehending something that runs so counter, even if you're using terminology that they should be able to work with.<br/><br/>I'm certainly not ragging on such folks. Nor am I trying to place myself as superior. I'm just anticipating comprehension difficulties based on my experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339691/#Comment_339691" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T16:11:50+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  4:11PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like jargon, it helps us knowing in a very precise way what we want to play or study.

And please don't think I was ripping on Jason for using jargon. I was merely contesting the fact that someone labled it "plain English", which it wasn't. And that's not a bad thing. In fact, jargon is what the OP was asking for. He wants terms that are the story game equivilant of " tile placement, route/network building, set collection, and area control" for board games.<br/><br/>And I think Jason nailed several of those terms in his 2 sentences.<br/><br/>I do have the following problem with the OP post, though.<br/><br/>He says that he wants to be able to have terminology that's good enough that, right off the bat, you would be able to recognize what games you like and what games you wouldn't.\n<blockquote>The way I see this, if I came into this subset of the gaming hobby right now and tried a single story game to see if I would keep on digging the body of games out there, it would basically be a coin toss. Pick a game I like, and I keep digging. But if I pick a game I don't, I'm done with story games with no inkling that this game has jackshit to do with that other game I was thinking of trying.</blockquote>\nI would argue that that's setting the bar a bit too high.<br/><br/>I think players need to approach gaming with an open mind and try a few different things if they're going to have any chance of finding games that are a super awesome fit for their tastes.<br/><br/>And also, some of the funkier techniques, like aggressive scene framing, take a while to get good at. I have yet to be in a game that feels like this technique is being used the way it sounds like it is when I read some AP reports.<br/><br/>The thing is, I think a lot of the design techniques are developing quickly enough right now that it's hard to create groupings and labelings and categories for things. I'm not sure that the game design field is in the same place the board game field is.<br/><br/>I don't know. When I look at board games, I have an easy time looking at how things are similar from one to another.<br/><br/>When I look at RPGs, my attention tends to be grabbed by what is different about that game. Especially when it's something neat and potentially reusable.<br/><br/>Like I read about Fronts in Apocalypse World. And I think, NEATO. I could use that idea to structure how the threats in my Savage Worlds fantasy game are organized.<br/><br/>And I think RPGs lend themselves to that sort of thing in a way that board games don't. You don't look at Puerto Rico and say "Sweet. I'm going to think about my resources in Power Grid as though they were workers in Puerto Rico and that will make my game experience better." That doesn't make any sense. Hell, it's quite likely to make you lose.<br/><br/>Not that this sort of thing is impossible. There are strategies that are easier to see in some games that would be really useful to apply to other games. That could happen. But it doesn't happen a lot.<br/><br/>The apples are not the same as the oranges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339703/#Comment_339703" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T18:26:51+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  6:26PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, just saying you want stronger jargon doesn't make it happen.<br/><br/>You have to figure out what sorts of things you are seeing that you don't have terms for yet.<br/><br/>That's what I did with player motives. I was seeing something that I felt was potentially useful for designers (especially larp event designers) to consider. So I put terms to it. It came out of a discussion on the larp forum at rpg.net where people were mixing together play style and stance and a bunch of other stuff into a big gobbly mess that wasn't helping describe what was going on. So I took a different angle - what does the player want out of the game? And a bunch of neato jargon was born.<br/><br/>So what are the things that people are seeing that they don't have good terms for? Cause that's what you have to start with in order to make good useful jargon. You have to have a thing you want to label before you can make a good label for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339710/#Comment_339710" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T19:59:03+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  7:59PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its starting to look like two conversations, jargon and recommendation-system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339714/#Comment_339714" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T20:56:55+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  8:56PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the core still remains a repository of knowledge.

So far, computers suck at telepathy.<br/><br/>So, from a practical standpoint, about the best that can be done in this vein right now is something like this:<br/><br/>o Create database a games<br/>o Have people who know what they are talking about tag games, using a quite large pool of tags like "gm-less", "group char gen", "hooks to starting situation", and so on.<br/>o Show users the list of tags.<br/>o Allow users to pick one or more tags, and list games that have them all.<br/><br/>Unlike the telepathy version of the problem, the tagging approach is fairly simple, technically speaking. The hard part is getting people to tag games. And to decide on what the tags are.

Make an entry per game, describing what solutions that game provides and how they go about doing it. And then use categories or tags or both to cross reference them. Bam.<br/><br/>Or you could use a wiki with some specific template structures and lots of cross links.<br/><br/>Or you could build out a fancy database and a PHP delivery platform.<br/><br/>But none of that is nearly as important as actually doing the work. Gathering the information. Parsing through hundreds of game texts and categorizing them.<br/><br/>And why would anyone do all that work? I don't know about you, but that's a LOT of time that I'd rather spend playing games, really.<br/><br/>I don't mean to poopoo the notion that it would be a valuable resource for some designers. But you know, really, most of the designers that would most benefit from it wouldn't know to look for the resource in the first place and probably wouldn't bother to make use of it if they did.<br/><br/>In larp forums especially, you see a random person every few months come on and, in their first post, say something like "So I just found out about this thing called larp. And I've been reading about it all day and it looks neat. But as far as I can tell the closest game to me is 90 minutes away and I can't drive or anything, so I want to make up my own larp and play it in the park down the street with my friends. Any suggestions about how to get started?"<br/><br/>And even though I answer that question regularly, and actually try to point the person in some useful directions based on other details of what they've posted (for example, 7/8ths of the people who post that are clearly more interested in fantasy boffer larps than anything else) I compile a list of things they should read through before they start. Like Madrigal and Glass and a few others that are good examples.<br/><br/>But really, the core of the answer is always always "Go play some games. Really. Even if it's far away and a hassle. Do it anyway. And until you've played at least a couple of very different games (not just 2 flavors of NERO style games) you shouldn't consider yourself ready to write your own."<br/><br/>And I think, ultimately, that's the answer to this question as well. Play more games. Play different games. Play new games.<br/><br/>I think that ends up being the best way to experience and remember what games are good at addressing what challenges.<br/><br/>That, and playing games is fun, right?<br/><br/>I don't mean to be dismissive of the idea of compiling a database of useful information. I just don't see who would do such a thing and when and why they would do it. And in particular, I don't see why someone would do such a thing from scratch.

They are closely related, as both of them sets out to create interactive drama by verbal interaction, but there is a general distinction. It's useful to have terms that implies this.<br/>Well, we've been through this before.  Originally, the FAQ on this forum suggested that "story games" were games with less emphasis on my character and more emphasis on our story.  However, that resulted in the problem of having to distinguish a boundary line.  Is Riddle of Steel a story game?  Is Everway?  Is Amber?  I don't recall exact details, but the general result was to drop trying to make distinctions about what is a story game and what isn't - and just call all role-playing games story games.  <br/><br/>As a possibility for adding to the trove of knowledge...<br/><br/>I could add to my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/encyclopedia/" rel="nofollow"><b>Encyclopedia of RPGs</b></a> to allow users to add in links, comments, and tags to a detail page for an individual RPG.  It would be some work on my part, but there would clearly be some advantages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340232/#Comment_340232" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-23T16:10:32+00:00" title="August 23, 2011  4:10PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.

The base document is very frequently updated, but the format of entries is very stable.  <br/><br/>So someone could set up an alternate site using the XML from my encyclopedia - but instead of changing that data, they should create new fields which "tack onto" each entry.  Then they could update the XML regularly from my site.  On the other hand, that's a chunk of programming there.  <br/><br/>If they just made a static copy of my site at present, they wouldn't get future updates - which I think would be non-ideal.  One mini-project I'm working on now is linking the Indie RPG Award data and my encyclopedia data.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340276/#Comment_340276" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T03:04:22+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  3:04AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            we have 17 entries on Google Spreadsheet.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/jhkim">@jhkim</a>: the excel data should be super easy to export to any format you might need                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340989/#Comment_340989" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-30T15:45:52+00:00" title="August 30, 2011  3:45PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apd6gC3wLZ9AdHZzaUJPaUpmVVFRamQ1UldVQkY2bFE&amp;hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">This is the list of tagged games:</a><br/><br/>Apocalypse World<br/>Becoming Heroes<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Don't Rest Your Head<br/>Fiasco<br/>Grey Ranks<br/>How We Came To Live Here<br/>In a Wicked Age<br/>Land of Nodd<br/>Montsegur 1244<br/>Puppetland<br/>Sign in Stranger<br/>Spione<br/>Steal Away Jordan<br/>Swords Without Master<br/>Perfect (Unrevised)<br/>Ribbon Drive<br/>Polaris<br/>Mouse Guard                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
