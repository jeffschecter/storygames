By hitting them, the players earn resources they can spend to do cool stuff. The early playtest made it clear that the GM needed a resource, too, to challenge the players in important conflicts. So the GM gets access to Adversity (or Peril; can't decide) he can spend for extra dice on challenges.<br/><br/>Some Adversity is earned at the start of each scene, and some when the PCs do certain stuff (like use sorcery, because it's blasphemous wossnamery that man was not meant to wot of), but I can't help but feel I'm missing an opportunity here. One of the great things about Keys is that they encourage certain sorts of play from the players - could they do the same for the GM?<br/><br/>Is there any mileage in the GM having keys - maybe tying into the game or session's theme - that earn him a resource when he hits on them in play with NPCs or scene-setting? Something like:-<br/><br/><b>The Key of Recurring Villainy</b>: gain 1 Peril when a villain engages a PC in a conflict, and then escapes to return in a later scene.<br/><br/>Or,<br/><br/><b>The Key of Blood-spattered Gore</b>: gain 1 Peril for describing an injury or death in a way that makes the players go "Eeeew!"<br/><br/>Or might this mess up the balance of play? Could it lead the GM to spend more time on finding ways to bring his Keys in and put less focus on the PCs? Has anyone used anything like this in their games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96057/#Comment_96057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T13:08:37+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  1:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chris Gardiner</cite>Could it lead the GM to spend more time on finding ways to bring his Keys in and put less focus on the PCs?</blockquote>\nHow about if the non-Gms determined the Keys?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96085/#Comment_96085" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T14:01:59+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  2:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite><br/>How about if the non-Gms determined the Keys?</blockquote>My thoughts exactly.

I thought the same thing five minutes after getting up from the keyboard - you're right, that makes the players an active part of the GMed Keys. Age of Steel has a semi-competitive element, so I'm thinking being able to set the GM's Keys for next session might make a nice reward for the winning player or compensation for the losing ones.<br/><br/>I'm wondering about what sort of GM behaviours the Keys could encourage. So far, I can think of:-<br/><br/>- <i>Atmosphere</i>: Keys of the Spooky Tale, Gory Tale, Melancholy Tale, etc.<br/>- <i>NPC actions</i>: Keys of Treachery, Vengeance, Recurring Villainy, etc.<br/>- <i>Scene-Framing</i>: Key of the Cliffhanger.<br/>- <i>Conflict types</i>: Key of the Hostile Wilderness, Key of the Fractious Relationship, Key of the Red Swords, etc.<br/><br/>Can anyone think of any others?

I think it might be relevant that in Age of Steel, Keys provide the player with resources they can spend to boost their chances of success rather than generating XP - so one function they serve is absolutely communicative, but there's also a resource-management function going on, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain" title="coffeestain"><img alt="coffeestain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain">coffeestain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96246/#Comment_96246" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T03:43:00+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  3:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Chris.

Are they transferrable to any GM-character, or to GM-characters engaged in the "keyful" activity? For example, if GM has Key of Returning Villain, gets 1 RP for re-introducing a villain, does that mean that a re-introduced villain gets a bonus?  This likely means the Keys are all about "adversity to PC's".  How would a key that implies "character-positive" actions work?<br/><br/>Is the purpose of the mechanic to create incentive/inclination to or away from certain sorts of play?<br/><br/>I can see this being useful in a "low-no GM" system of distributed authority where there are Game-Keys to encourage players to provide adversity and to provide it of a type suitable to the genre of the story, it's themes etc.  Without "keys" the resource system of a game like Universalis does reward "re-introduced" elements like a villain (or hero) just by making it cheaper to re-use, but doesn't reward re-introducing a theme, image, colour (e.g., treachery, gore, scary atmosphere).  I could imagine a gimmick to it to do just that though "Introducing "gory" to the scene (giving a one die trait to draw on for anything spilling blood).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96306/#Comment_96306" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T09:16:11+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  9:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aren't Key Scenes supposed to be the keys for GMs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96309/#Comment_96309" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T09:24:00+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  9:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric nails it!

Earn 1 Fortune for losing a challenge, or 3 for giving in a conflict.<br/><br/>So maybe some GM conditions for this key might be: Confront this hero with a challenge of at least X dice, or When the hero suffers a tragedy?<br/><br/>I think that's really interesting, but I wonder if it might be even cooler if the Keys were explicitly devoted to GM tasks, and built from the ground up with GMs in mind.<br/><br/>Being able to talk this stuff through is really useful - I'd got rather stuck. So this is much appreciated!<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>- Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96315/#Comment_96315" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T09:58:48+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  9:58AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>Can you give examples of how the GM resources would be used? Are they transferrable to any GM-character, or to GM-characters engaged in the "keyful" activity? For example, if GM has Key of Returning Villain, gets 1 RP for re-introducing a villain, does that mean that a re-introduced villain gets a bonus? This likely means the Keys are all about "adversity to PC's". How would a key that implies "character-positive" actions work?</blockquote>\nSure! The GM resource is called adversity. It's actually attached to specific PCs, so a hero might have 3 points of adversity in his pool. Adversity can only be used by the GM against the hero whose pool it was in. Spending adversity typically grants the GM extra dice on a roll against the PC. If one of the NPCs is opposing the PC, then Fortune basically increases one of the NPC's stats against that hero for the duration of the conflict. It can also be used to activate NPCs special abilities. <br/><br/>Currently, a hero gets a point of adversity at the start of each scene, but heroes can do things that increase their adversity pool, too.\n<blockquote>Is the purpose of the mechanic to create incentive/inclination to or away from certain sorts of play?</blockquote>\nThe initial purpose was to provide the GM with a resource to make things more difficult to the PCs. But if that system's going in there, I'm interested in seeing if it could also be used to encourage certain sorts of play from the GM.<br/><br/>There's an element of competition in the game - players compete to see who was the real hero of the tale, and I want both players and GM to have defined economies that regulate their accumulation of resources.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96317/#Comment_96317" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T10:08:50+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 10:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Aren't Key Scenes supposed to be the keys for GMs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>Eric nails it! People forget about those.</blockquote>\nHi guys!<br/><br/>I used Key Scenes religiously for 16 sessions of my Sweet20-based D&amp;D game, and eventually stopped because I could never work out how to make real use of them. Maybe you could advise me if I was doing something wrong?<br/><br/>As I understand it, the GM creates a number of Key Scenes, like "Tesha returns to her demonic family to find out her mother is planning on selling her hand in marriage to the highest bidder", or "Typhon's mentor at the arena asks him to throw a match". When these scenes come into play, the PCs each earn some XP.<br/><br/>In our game, this never worked out as being anything other than - essentially - XP for turning up. The players played. Every few scenes they got XP. But I don't feel they were guiding my GMing at all, and the really good scenes weren't necessarily the Key Scenes, they were the ones where a player hit the major condition of one of their Keys. We switched to a system where when someone achieved that major condition, every other PC earned an XP too, which encourages people to arrange fruitful situations for each other.<br/><br/>Have I just misunderstood how Key Scenes work?<br/><br/>Also, based on my above posts, is it clear how what I'm after with GM-Keys is different to what Key Scenes do? If not, I obviously need to do a better job of explaining, or I've missed something fundamental.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96323/#Comment_96323" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T10:26:06+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 10:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 1of3</cite>Chris, doesn't that miss the point of Keys? When my character has a Key, that tells the GM what I want him to provide. So if the GM had keys, shouldn't that tell the players what to provide?</blockquote>\nRIght - been thinking about this. I think Keys serve a few functions. <br/><br/>1) They are (like you said) a message to the GM saying "This is what I want to see."  <br/>2) They serve as a guide to players. A player with the Key of Compassion is more likely to behave in a compassionate way, even in situation that the GM hadn't established to test that Key. They're useful prompts in play. If I'm a player and I'm at a loose end regarding what to do next, I can take a look at my Keys and do something that brings me closer to hitting one.<br/><br/>In Age of Steel, that first function is built right into adventure creation - an adventure isn't done until the GM has generated elements that tie into all the heroes' Keys. The second function is what ties into the resource economy - by acting in accordance with their Drives, the heroes earn Fortune which they can use to do cool stuff. The idea is: acting in accordance with your drives = increased fortune = increased ability to act.<br/><br/>In the playtest this worked really well. By doing the things that made them who they are, the heroes earned resources that let them be even more heroic. People jived with this very quickly, even the ones who hadn't experienced indie-gaming before (This is why I love Keys - they're so intuitive. People get to grips with them right away. Thank you, Clinton!).<br/><br/>What I'm wondering is: can the same benefits be achieved for the GM? Might it be productive to link the GM's resource system to specific behaviours and conditions in a similar way that Keys do for players, so that they provide a moment-by-moment guide to running the game? Something to go to if you're stumped or looking for inspiration, and reminders regarding what the game is about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96361/#Comment_96361" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T14:01:00+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  2:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is pretty much exactly what I was setting out to do with the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3867" rel="nofollow">coolmap</a>.

Brief summary: You have a diagram of all the themes and entities in the setting and how they relate to one another. People initial the ones they're into. When these themes turn up in the game, you get one GM point; when they're the focus of conflict, you get 1 GM point per initial against them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97059/#Comment_97059" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T02:04:11+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  2:04AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's *very* cool. And very elegant. I guess, in Age of Steel, something like that could work by having a list of themes appropriate to sword and sorcery stories (Cliffhangers, Untamed Wilderness, Decadent Civilisation, etc), and then having people look over it and initial the ones they like, then those being the ones the GM jots down and aims for.<br/><br/>I've been thinking a bit more about this whole Keys-for-the-GM idea, and one thing I'm not sure about is whether there's ever a good reason for the GM to be encouraged to do something that the players aren't. If the GM has the Key of Cliffhanging, his job is still going to be complicated if the players aren't driving towards cliffhangers as well.<br/><br/>So now I'm wondering if each adventure should have a key or two, and anytime the players hit it they get fortune, and any time the GM hits it he gets to put some adversity down. Maybe it could be weighted so the GM gets more points, or something, though, since the players ave other means of gaining fortune, and that bit of the economy seems to work ok.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97226/#Comment_97226" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T12:52:40+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 12:52PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Credit where it's due, the coolmap is a mashup of a TonyLB idea and the game Verge, plus of course TSOY Keys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
