Instead of taking you on a pillaging spree around the Carribean, he has somehow sent you up this river and now you've runaground in a desert and are lost. <br/><br/>But what's this? <br/><br/>You spy a cloud of dust in the distance. Horseman!  They look a bit funny but they're travelling light so can't be going far. In fact, they ride straight towards you.<br/><br/>Here they are in their funny coats. They start asking about the guy on the yardarm and what sins have been committed. Strangely they seem friendly although they keep arguing amongst themselves. One of them wants to shoot you all but the others think what you need is a bit of a sing-song.<br/><br/>So you kill them anyway and take their coats. <br/><br/>Now you ride out across the desert in search of plunder, rum and women.

I'm sure every second person who has played both games has thought what a good merge they'd make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
