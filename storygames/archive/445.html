<p>So first, a little background on me:</p>
<p>When I walk into a game, I generally have a character idea that I can summarise in a few words... "flying poet-baker", "joan-of-arc mechanic", "charming Mentat", &amp;c. It does me precious little good to hang Flags, situations, links to the larger setting, and stuff off such a character; I will often forget that such things are even <em>there</em> and when encountering them in play, they come as a surprise, and sometimes my interest has shifted away and they slide off unnoticed.</p>
<p>Then these characters gradually crystallise in play, or play doesn't last long enough for the character to harden and start to 'work'.</p>
<p>So this has led me to turn away from games with a lot of character generation, or to get skittish around it. Ask Jonathan how long it took me to write my Power of Brilliance!</p>
<p>Can I get chargen to work for me?</p>

The first question is, of course, why?<br/><br/>To unpack that a bit: <br/><br/>Why play a game over just creating fiction?<br/>Why are flags unimportant?<br/>Do you consider your character concept inviolate?<br/>Do you consider adding flags and the like a violation?<br/><br/>In other words:<br/><br/>Games are abotu sharing an intellectual space.  In order to do that, there needs to be a ground of common understanding and compromise between players.  What is it about the process of sharing or compromise that you don't like?<br/><br/>Then, tell us only the good things that come to mind about your mother.                        </div>

Shreyas, how would you feel about a hypothetical system where the characters were generated during play itself? A bit like Dogs, where the relationships can be decided during play, but with pretty much the whole of chargen occurring during play?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>Why are flags unimportant? 'Cause, at the time of construction, I dunno if they'll be applicable to <em>that character.</em> A few sessions into the game I'll be all fired up with "hey Mr. GM I want to create a new religion based on my privileged knowledge of the metaphysics of the world and thereby become UNDISPUTED GOD-KING BIRDS-OF-TRINITY THE INCOMPARABLE," which, while not really strictly Flaggy, is certainly a pretty clear statement of "what I wanna do".</p>

<p>Graham,</p>
<p>I have a really negative aesthetic reaction to Dogs, so I'm just gonna pretend you didn't mention it. I played a brief The Pool game of that description, though, and it was fun, but it was a one-shot so I don't know how well it would have panned out in the long run.</p>

I think it's a play difference - I always start out with at least a 50/50 idea of where the character's been and his past - but not if that will be applicable to the character or the current game.  Certainly I like an amount of haziness at character creation, but I see characters as me interrupting the life of someone who would otherwise would go on about their business without me.<br/><br/>And I find that starting out with one set of expectations and winding up with a different reality helps with the 'fish out of water' feeling that most good stories have - take <i>Die Hard</i> for instance.  Yes, he's a cop - but he's never been pushed <i>like that</i> before.  So you start out with one set of expectations and have to take it to the next level, so to speak.                        </div>

                            Hi Shreyas,<br/><br/>It sounds to me you are saying something similiar to:
<blockquote>...and keeping in mind my choices are made to try to define the core of the character to enter actor stance. Some choices are made badly, and I flounder until I start to "get" the character. Once I get the character then I'm golden. This is what drives my dislike of playing shorter games, and my preference to want to play longer games. Previously I had to take several sessions time to find what I think Belief and Instincts may create for me in a shorter time. I think this is one of the things I liked about L5R it had Bushido to point me towards how to respond. </blockquote>
That quote is taken from <a href="http://www.indiegamingunderground.com/viewtopic.php?t=150" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indiegamingunderground.com/viewtopic.php?t=150</a> and it was made by me. So if we aren't on the same page ignore the rest of the post. Otherwise...<br/><br/>Have you tried playing Burning Wheel? If not and you know someone who knows how to run it I'd recommend having them run the demo titled "The Sword" for you. I was amazed by my first experience with Burning Wheel because I was immediately able to start groking who the pre-generated character was and was able to respond as the character, just like that.<br/><br/>The magic for me wasn't the goals so much, although the goals were very helpful it was the instincts that really grabbed me. They were something that is generated at chargen that let me know who the character was. They're very simple, it's just a set of statements with these structures:
<blockquote><b>If</b> condition, <b>then</b> reaction equals X. <br/><b>Always</b> do X.<br/><b>Never</b> do X.<br/></blockquote>
Here's specific examples from the rogue I played.
<blockquote>1. I always haggle.<br/>2. Always cheat.<br/>3. Never throw the first punch.<br/></blockquote>
Those three lines got me right into character without the normal stumbling I have to do to figure out the character. You can do them for every game you play, as long as it isn't a hardcore Narrativist game, since you don't "own" anything in those games. (There's no venom in that last sentence guys.)<br/><br/>Hope I was helpful.                        </div>

                            I can not only see where Shreyas is coming from, but tend to agree. The more 'stuff' on my character sheet, and the more I feel disconnected from them. Broadly painted strokes defining the character work best for me. That being said, when I approach a game with a lot of character creation rules, I tend to just go with the flow. I don't sweat every little detail, but grab the things that stand out and are colorful. This doesn't always make the most effective characters (you should see my WotG character!) but ones I can play.                        </div>

                            Shreyas, it seems to me that what you dislike isn't character generation per se, it's character generation that is not paired with powerful character development.  It seems like you would be best served by a game where you had opportunities to create flags as you go, and to remove flags that no longer interest you.  The character sheet as an immutable thing created before play, and especially the <em>character</em> as an immutable thing created before play, sounds like the problem.  Does that sound accurate?                        </div>

<br/>
I think there is a cool game that could be built out of this. Maybe set up an explicity set of Motivations, Issues, or whatever you want to call them, then give the player a pool of Foo points with which to add flags in play in the pursuit of those Motivations. Something like...<br/>
<br/>
<b>Avenge My Father's Death</b> (x unspent Foo)<br/>
The Sword That Killed Him xdFoo<br/>
<b>Woo my beloved</b> (x unspent Foo)<br/>
Knowledge of her favorite Poet xdFoo<br/>
Her Father's Favor xdFoo<br/>
<br/>
etc. When you achieve a Motivation (avenge your father or secure your beloved, in this case), you take the Foo points out of the flags you had bought, and then get to use them to add flags in pursuit of your <i>new</i> Motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Crap. I'm not done with my first game yet, and I want to write this...hmm,  maybe its time to raise Hearths from the dead...<br/>
<br/>
P.S: The answer to that is yes. Goodbye, free time! ^_~                        </div>

                            For a concrete example, Shreyas, in FLFS your three primary flags can be swapped out at the end of every session.  So of you were the Gentleman and that wasn't doing it for you, you can swap that out and be a Rake, instead.  The next situation would be use Rake as an inspiration instead of Gentleman.                        </div>

I don't have this problems with Issues, Kickers, Flags and similar stuff. I think the reason is, that I design my character around those. When I made up my current Mage character I thought something like:<br/>
<br/>
<i>He awakened during a dive trip. He was first taught by a Dreamspeaker but then turned to the Cult. Will he become a Dreamspeaker or a Cultist?</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your problem (It isn't really a problem. More a preference.) is that you perceive something else central for your characters.                        </div>

  I don't know if I can SELL you on something you don;t like already. But I can tell you what chargen is good for:<br>
 - Telling other players what your char is about<br>
 - Filling in the char sheet with what you decided before to bring some ocontinuity to your char<br>
 - Teling you where your char came from. Which may not have anything to do with where they are going...<br>
 - Defining what your character can and cannot do<br>
  The trick is, there is plenty of ways to do all that. So, find that game that does it the way you want and have fun!<br>

Out of interest (because it sounds a bit like my experience, too) - what do you <i>do</i> in play during those first sessions? Trying to "find" what makes the character tick beyond the basic concept of "ponderous pirate"? Does the setting/situation have anything to do with the direction the character takes (i.e. are you fishing for setting-hooks)?<br/>

<p>herrmess,</p>
<p>It's hard for me to speculate about that, really; I generally portray character in artist-intuition-creative mode (which is, to me, sharply distinct from "designing or using crunchy stuff", which happens in scientist-logic-opposition mode), and I don't do so good at analysing that.</p>
<p>If you're interested in glancing through a fairly short Actual Play record, I can dig up the Nobilis game I play with Jonathan and (a) Josh. My character Colin crystallised fairly fast there, so it might be illuminating to someone who <em>can</em> apply analytical capacity to it.</p>
<p>Generally, I don't feel like I am searching for the character to ignite (it's like a fire; it takes some small amount of fuel and a large amount of work to start, and then it goes my itself); there's just a marked change when it <em>does,</em> at which point I start feelin' invested in the character, and I can start seeing that character as a creative work, rather than just a socket into the shared fiction.</p>

  The other thing that chargen does is gives you is a past to go back to. Cyclops is the most annoying and whiney X-Man ever. But when he has dealings with his brother the story gets interesting...<br>

                            Was that stuff with Cyclops's brother introduced at the same time as the character? If not, then it's not chargen--it's retroactive construction of a relationship.                        </div>

Sounds to me a bit like chargen-in-play, as in the character is not "created" yet when you start playing. My terminology is a bit awkward because I am not sure the character is ever fully "created", in a complete-desription sense. <br>
<br>
In my experience many people are uncomfortable playing that way (because of the ingrained "chargen phase" vs "playing phase"), when in practice playing like this would be a lot easier for them. One of them small ropleplaying paradoxes. <br>

                            Hermess, I think you're underestimating why and how a lot of people play.  For lots of folks, the character is a mask or costume that they inhabit when they play -- and you can't inhabit half of a mask.  They need enough personal context in order to play in the first place -- and then they can riff and shift and manipulate the character.  But they need that starting 'oomph' first.                        </div>

                            Historically, (and I may be inventing a lot of this history, in which case please consider it a charming alegory) chargen served a strategic purpose.  In particularly hack-n-slashy games, where a lot of the meat of the game was overcoming a challenge, you settled up front what your character was and was not.  So mechanical balance was really important, in order to provide the basis of the strategic challenge at chargen, and as the foundation for the challenge of play.  You could even say that a lot of the diseases we see in older fantasy games are a natural and necessary result of framing the games that way.<br>
<br>
But the analogy I'd make is that, for there to be a _*game*_ to it, you do need some kind of challenge.  That could be a strategic challenge, or it could be a narrative challenge.  And laying out, committing to "enough" of your character ahead of time is a challenge in and of itself.  Then the character you've committed to is the foundation for narrative challenge as the game goes on.<br>
<br>
Chargen is by no means the only way to establish challenge in any RPG, but it's a means that's tested by time, and if you take a game that builds it's challenge on chargen and then strip that out, you're changing the activity from game to toy, IMO.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Mo, otoh, is not going to have "story game fun" (as opposed to "board game fun") unless she's had a character to invest in emotionally prior to contact with the fiction.

                            There's long-since been a DIP (Develop in Play) vs DAS (Develop at Start) argument between gamers -- once that like many rpg-related political arguments, tends to only get acknowledged by one side (in this case, the DIP guys).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I tend to like a lot of DAS--it sets up situations and reactions, and front-loads negotiation rather than forcing you to alternate in narrative play between "narrative play" and "negotiation" (and I do consider it a weakness of games like PTA, at least for me, that they often require a lot of negotiation during narrative play) or mix them.   But it's nice to have -some- in-play development; ideally, pre-"game" development should provide vectors which in play continue to move (like Fate in an ideal Everway game) rather than nailing you down to something that may end up being less than ideal in play or slowing down the start of play.<br/>
<br/>
In a similar way, I far prefer pre-written larps to "players create their characters" larps -- because the former allows a huge amount of frontloaded situation, allowing a 4 hour game with enoumous numbers of things getting resolved and multiple plotlines to climax.  By contrast, a "player create their characters" larp will tend to have the first 4-20 hours of any given player's play involve meeting and developing situations with other players (admitedly, such a game will usually be at least partially "adventure style" so situations will be introduced externally...but you still lack the richness of having established complications with other primary PCs), and only then can you really engage in the kind of play you can get in a pre-written larp right away.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, a tabletop rpg, having a much faster information velocity (ie, as soon as you say something it's part of the game text, whereas in a 20 person game, something might only become part of the text 15 minutes or an hour after you start it because of the need for the information to hit everyone it involves directly), can bootstrap this stuff much faster, but having at least -some- info frontloaded can be very useful.                        </div>
