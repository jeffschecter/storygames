I hope that's OK with you, Andy!]</i><br/><br/>Last night I met up with some gamers--all strangers to me--to play <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>, as a one-shot game. I'm reporting because of a couple of interesting things that came up, and a question it raised for me about the way many gamers seem to approach this game.<br/><br/>And, boy, was it an interesting game of IaWA. They organized the game via an online Meetup.com event, which meant guests RSVP and then show up. Six people were supposed to be there. A big group, to my eyes, but, hey, why not? Sounds like a fun challenge.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, shortly after people started arriving, the number grew to <i>nine</i>. I was wondering, "how is this going to go?" I can't remember the last time I played a game with nine people. Yikes! And we only had about two or two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Most of the players were self-avowed <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> fans, and said it was their number-one game, which they played regularly. Despite this, most claimed to be fairly unclear on the rules (as it turned out, this was true). There were also a few newbies ("I've only played D&amp;D, and one game of Werewolf..."). Most of the people knew each other, but there were a few people, like myself, who were new to the group.<br/><br/>Two of the players decided to co-GM the game. That left seven players.<br/><br/>The two GMs began to introduce the game, making a big point of how this was a "narrative-based game", and not your typical RPG. "There are some dice involved, but we very rarely roll them. You only roll if you want to roll, as you'll see." "We brainstorm characters and create the plot together before we play." I found this disclaimer interesting.<br/><br/>Next, another unusual procedure: the GMs had everyone close their eyes, and then announced different movie ratings: "PG-13!" "NC-17!" etc. We were supposed to raise our hand if the rating being named was the highest level we wanted to handle explicitly in the game. Someone chose "PG-13", so that was our cutoff, in terms of game content. (For the record, all the players were adults)<br/><br/>This seemed like a pretty good idea on a number of levels, but felt very strange to me in the context of a game like <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> For instance, it meant we just threw out the "Blood &amp; Sex" Oracle altogether, since it was too likely that something un-PG would come up. We then voted on which Oracle to use, and ended up drawing two cards from The Unquiet Past, and two from Nest of Vipers. One of the cards was deemed "uninteresting", and another drawn. Then characters were brainstormed, and (I believe) eight were identified. <br/><br/>"We need more characters," said the GMs. "We need at least half as many NPCs as there are PCs, so we need to draw another card." (Need more NPCs? With seven PCs in the game and less than two hours to play? Hmmmm.) We ended up drawing two more, from Nest of Vipers.<br/><br/>Nothing too unusual here, but I got the impression that mixing Oracles and drawing whatever number of cards they liked was the standard procedure.<br/><br/>Then there was a brief "demo" of a conflict, with dice being rolled, but no narration taking place. ("He didn't double me, so we roll again...") Again, close to right, but something felt a little off to me here. I'm pretty sure the few newbies didn't get much out of the demo, except to see that certain dice would be rolled and that the highest number mattered. Also, the GM who was facilitating had the impression that we "roll initiative" for the first round of an action sequence, but not subsequent rounds. The "initiative" was handled correctly, though, despite several of the experienced IaWA players thinking that being doubled in the initial roll meant everything was over.<br/><br/>We spent a good deal of time banging out Best Interests (with a fair bit of success), using a "conflict map". People seemed to find a lot of glee in the messy picture that resulted, even though we didn't really ever refer to that page after we began playing. Then players were instructed to take some time to write a physical description of their character on their sheets (this gave several players pause, and took a while), even though we were never prompted in any way to describe our characters in play.<br/><br/>Finally, we assigned dice to forms and skipped Particular Strengths (which seemed a wise thing to do, since time was running out quick; probably half the session was up by this point).<br/><br/>To begin the game, one GM intoned "In a Wicked Age..." and described three of the characters meeting out on the street outside a mansion (which was one of the elements drawn). The first difficulty that arose was that many players were asking, "Do I know so-and-so? How long have I been doing X?" The GMs responded that you can just decide whatever you like, and not worry about background details. "You can narrate anything you want. Only, if you disagree with something someone else says, you can roll dice against them." The GMs explained that you could roll dice against another player if you disagreed about something. Note: not characters disagreeing, but players disagreeing.<br/><br/>Example from play: "Have we signed the deed yet?" "I thought we had." "No, I think it's better if we're still waiting to sign it." "But the card we drew said, 'deed, signed and sealed'!" "Do you guys want to roll dice over this?"<br/><br/>Fortunately, in actual play only conflicts between characters led to dice-rolling, with backstory stuff being quickly negotiated by the players. This was good.<br/><br/>The players with characters in the scene began to posture and talk to each other, doing funny voices and being entertaining, but without doing anything to move the story along. In response to inactivity, the GMs started to introduce the other characters into the scene one by one, but without introducing conflict. e.g. "Oh, yeah, while you're talking, you see there's a red-haired woman across the street who can see you."<br/><br/>This reminded me of my one failed attempt to play IaWA in the past, where I was GMing, and a very similar lack of anything *happening* took place. <br/><br/>Things continued much in the same vein, with players entertaining each other with dialogue and, it seems, waiting for something to happen. An NPC (demons possessing the mansion) caused conflicts via one of the GMs narrating bizarre stuff into play, like "for some reason, you can't climb the stairs, like your legs won't respond to your commands." Some dice were rolled over this sort of thing, with minimal narration. Here, something interesting happened:<br/><br/>When a person would win a conflict, the GMs explained: "Now, you, loser, have to narrate how the other person wins. And if you don't make it interesting enough, they can take away your dice [i.e. damage two forms]." Comical descriptions of failure were quickly delivered and commended: "Great job! You certainly understand this game. I won't take away any of your dice."<br/><br/>In future conflicts, much the same took place. The loser would narrate their failure in some drastic fashion ("I fall down the stairs, and my cloak falls off, and I land on the ground facefirst, then skid out the front door, like this: Ouch!"). When I won a conflict and said, "OK, great, but can't I negotiate now for some actual consequences, in exchange for not damaging the dice?", there were some very confused looks around the table, and people seemed uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I was informed that, anyway, damaging dice wasn't all that important, because the all "refreshed at the start of the next session, anyway".<br/><br/>The game progressed as a comedy of errors, mainly involving slapstick humour. Which was, mind you, played up to good effect, and many players were both entertained and entertaining. My character was a hapless, luckless murderer, who begged his murder victim to help him plead with his wife. An unlucky cultist tried to climb the stairs several times, and each time ended up sliding out the door on his ass. Someone fell out of the window. Shingles from the house fell down on buyers whenever the seller was trying to convince them of its value, leading to more laughs.<br/><br/>But it seemed like little was ever at stake in the game. For instance, one of the characters was a magical bird, whose Best Interests were to steal some hair from the red-haired woman. The entirety of her involvement with the game was to swoop in at random moments, pluck out a hair, and then fly off (out of the scene). But everyone seemed to find it terribly funny. And it was, from time to time. Getting in-character and goofing around can be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>However, it reminded me of gaming in past years, where I seem to remember feeling that this was what <i>roleplaying was all about</i>. In other words, the GM provides plot, and the players provide Color and laughs by portraying their characters. Roleplaying = talking in funny voices, Rollplaying = rolling dice to fight things. Everything else ("story") is the territory of the GM. It seems to me that in this game, without the GMs injecting story, everyone was a little lost, and my own failed game a year ago was a fumble for the same reason.<br/><br/>My question is:<br/><br/>Am I remembering correctly? Are a lot of gamers out there kind of conditioned to expect and enjoy contributing to a game purely by character-portrayal? And become paralyzed or confused when the burden of moving along the plot falls on them? Or is my memory playing tricks on me?<br/><br/>I also seem to remember that those gamers who were considered "great roleplayers" were sometimes people who learned to break up this tedium by throwing their characters into wacky, unexpected situations, creating thereby surprise and conflict. But, in IaWA, it seems to me that everyone has to do this. To enter any scene with a clear direction for the character. And to push for their desires. But it seemed that in this game, people really were just so used to merely acting out dialogue or non-essential actions ("I take a piece of the bush and braid it into a hat for my pet donkey!") that this was not a comfortable thing for them.<br/><br/>I'm curious to hear what you think.<br/><br/>Finally, no long post is complete without a personal attack: I must demonstrate what I mean by the above, for otherwise my writing here would be mere character-portrayal, and not conflict-inducing. Therefore I must say that all these people proudly say that they have learned to play <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> from Ryan (Ry). Ha! Time to roll the dice, Ryan! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258757/#Comment_258757" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T11:03:45+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 11:03AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one more interesting note in terms of how they handled the rules:<br/><br/>1. The GMs instructed us that whatever forms we chose, we had to stick to narrating within those forms for the entire conflict. I pointed out that this was not entirely how I think the game is supposed to be played, since it can limit the natural development of conflicts. The more knowledgeable GM explained, however, that they were more interested in how the text was written, and following that faithfully, than in playing the game the way the designer intended. Well, fair enough: I was the newcomer, so I kept mum. To my relief, though, this rule was never enforced.<br/><br/>2. In group conflicts, everyone made a big point of organizing the involved parties into two sides, "OK, so it's so-and-so with so-and-so, against character B and C. Anyone want to support either side?" If someone on the opposite side of the conflict had bigger dice than you, then you would go on the Owe List after the first round. They didn't seem to see that it was actually important that you ROLL against that person, since they would determine this before the dice ever hit the table and Challenges were announced (when they were announced, if they were announced).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm really curious if these people play in this style every week, game in and game out. I'll have to ask them next time I get the chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258762/#Comment_258762" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T11:10:44+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 11:10AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

I use it every game, especially with new players or at cons.<br/><br/>Sounds like somewhat typical reactionary play. If playing IAWA, that means the Best Interests were (a) not of interest to the players and/or (b) not in direct conflict (PC v PC or PC v NPC, no matter). I wouldn't say EVERY scene has to have face-stabbing conflict; but very few will have it if the conflicts <span style="color: #FF0000;">are not </span>"baked in" to the initial situation.<br/><br/>But I'd really say it broke down due to not knowing (or, rather, not understanding) the play procedures, how the We Owe List operates, or (obviously) negotiating with The Stick. You didn't PLAY In A Wicked Age; you used (some of) its situation generator, basically. I'm not sure there's any more to unpack than that, here.<br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">[edit]</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258769/#Comment_258769" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T11:22:02+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 11:22AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, they did a really good job of the Best Interests.

Some of it may be habit from playing other games where the GM sets up adversity and/or story for the players, who just have to respond.  Some of it may be stage fright, especially when drama rather than comedy is on the table.<br/><br/>I ran IAWA earlier this week for a group of four players (organized through Meetup.com, by the way!).  At one point there was talk of a fifth player joining us.  While I was open to the idea, I was a little worried that it would get too big at that point.  Too little screen time for the individual PCs.  Also, we were mostly strangers to each other with varying levels of experiences with the game, so we were putting energy into getting to know each other, feeling out each other's style, teaching/learning the rules, etc.  The more people, the more complicated that process becomes.  We're getting together next month for another session.  I'm looking forward to how it will play out, now that we've sussed each other out and understand the system. <br/><br/>I will say that this group seemed more comfortable with moving the story along and going for conflict than others with whom I've played.  Maybe I'm getting better at explaining how the game should work, but I think it's more likely due to this group having experience with games that foreground player agency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258783/#Comment_258783" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T12:20:58+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 12:20PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2010 12:22PM by jenskot.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, your post is hilarious. I love your in depth analysis of gaming. I can't wait till you come back to NY.<br/><br/>This is my favorite:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>When a person would win a conflict, the GMs explained: "Now, you, loser, have to narrate how the other person wins. And if you don't make it interesting enough, they can take away your dice [i.e. damage two forms]." Comical descriptions of failure were quickly delivered and commended: "Great job! You certainly understand this game. I won't take away any of your dice."</blockquote>\nTo answer your question, I've played with so many people with so many different RPG backgrounds its hard to generalize. People who grew up playing 1st edition D&amp;D feel very different than people who played 2nd edition vs. 3rd vs. 4th vs. playing Call of Cthulhu, Shadowrun, vampire, and on and on... and of course within groups there is huge variation. <br/><br/>In general I find a lot of games that require you to use your characters to drive toward conflict work really well with players who have GMed or with people who have never roleplayed before with no expectations. But I don't really know. There are a lot of people who won't participate unless you say "roll initiative" and others who only contribute to interpret dice rolls "I succeeded, I do all this cool stuff", "I failed, all this cool stuff happens to me." <br/><br/>The GM is also a huge factor. How do they lead by example? What example are they setting? What behaviors do they reward? If the players are unfamiliar with the rules, people will game the GM. <br/><br/>I have also noticed the size of the group is a huge factor. I find more players drive towards conflict in groups of 3-4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258785/#Comment_258785" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T12:24:55+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 12:24PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a wicked age... haunted houses baffle luckless homeowners who, in turn, are beset by hair-stealing birds? <br/><br/>Just sounds like you've failed the genre <i><b>SPECTACULARLY!</b></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258793/#Comment_258793" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T12:47:45+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 12:47PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>They just didn't act on it play, for the most part.</blockquote>So they didn't do A. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>I mean, if they're weaving donkey hats and playing demonic pranks on home buyers, and that's not in their Best Interests and there's nothing to which someone would cry out, "ONYDYA!" then... not IAWA. Scarp the Oracles and start over, or maybe go to Abulafia and try a different setting's Oracles?<br/><br/>As a parallel: wouldn't it be like showing up to play Texas Hold 'Em, but then folks started doing card and poker chip tricks or playing psyche-out games with each others' heads; but only Check-Folded for their betting? Are you still "playing Texas Hold 'Em" at that table? It LOOKS like it--LOOK, there's the chips and the community cards and the button! But no one is really interested in taking the other players' money nor is even really engaging the "system" that is betting and pot-odd calculation....<br/><br/>-----<br/>As for the unpack--not at all, lately, but I've done a LOT to drift "story techniques" into other games. Also, my own RP background for years was with Hero/Champions, and many, many of the Disadvantages end up driving the story lines--one of the earliest examples of player agency I can recall experiencing (now that I know what to call it). Those Hunteds and Reputations can completely overshadow some GM railroad plot, unless the GM ignores them. And in those munchkin days, the players sometimes LOVED to have Disads ignored--that was free points! And being a GM that would NEVER ignore them, I worked closely with players during creation, making sure they would enjoy their Disads, or rewrite them.<br/><br/>Hmmm... but that only "drive[s] toward conflict and story" in as much as the players resolve to overcome (buy off) their Disads, which in turn makes them want to confront them, gain Exp, and then buy off. (Let's set aside that it's not in the RAW that Exp to buy off Disads must come from confronting them--in fact, many couldn't be legitimately "confronted" in an Exp-gaining way, using Hero systems. I wouldn't let a PC beat up a bunch of mooks and their crimelord boss and then say, "Wow, OK, that 5 Exp buys off my Fear of Spiders!") If I'm Hunted by, say, the US Government, then I'm going to want to "clear my name" at some point, driving story to a point where I've gained the 15 Exp or so to buy it off (which could be upwards of 5 sessions, in some Hero groups).<br/><br/>Then again, we all made "complex, brooding, prima donna" heroes; we'd LOVE to have a series of sessions focus on our Disads and back stories and relationships and arch rivals! Not idea what to run tonight, GM? Well that means it would be a PERFECT time for me to see psychotheraphy and maybe run a sort of "mental encounter" where I battle my worst fear! (Energy Blasting Giant Spiders for Health and Happiness).<br/><br/>So I guess I've only really encountered it at all, lately, with folks who've played almost exclusively illusionist (D&amp;D) games or WW games built around exploring the WOD canon. Then, yeah, first times with BW or DitV or IAWA go clunky for a bit, until I draw out the conflicts, to use the phrase from the other IAWA thread going on at the moment.<br/><br/>And then it's only the rare individual that doesn't want to contribute or take the wheel (to "drive," get it?). I've certainly played a session or two of some "story games" with folks who just didn't get it, didn't pursue their Beliefs or Interests, and sat "waiting for their turn to attack." Usually, those "campaigns" died fast (or, if one-shots, that person just couldn't be drawn out and had to be given things to which to react--they hitch their caboose to someone else's train).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258798/#Comment_258798" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T13:15:03+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  1:15PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where\u2019s the emoticon where the smiley face blows out his brains?<br/><br/>Paul, I've had versions of your experience various times over the past few years (i.e. since I started paying attention to such things).

In other words, if I make a character who is not pursuing their best interests hard, what happens <i>then</i> that is compelling? If (as someone put it), Jimmy McNulty's best interest is to stop drinking and listen to Lieutenant Daniels, and he does <i>nothing of the kind</i>, that can certainly be a compelling story, but only because McNulty comes stumbling into the room and fucks an alligator or something.  Players who aren't used to or don't really like PvP are not going to go charging after best interests in a roomful of strangers, it just isn't going to happen. I just met this person and I have no clue how they are going to react at all when I obliterate them.  So even if they write a good, pointed, at-your-guy best interests, they're going to be as reasonable as they can about it, and will often give the farm away just because they were asked to, and if there are no consequences to failure to pursue the best interests, the game will grind to a halt, as you saw.<br/><br/>Second, "conditioning" is the wrong word - it is entirely negative and discounts the idea that player preferences are aesthetic choices based on taste. Plenty of players like giving input into the game world strictly through their character.  It is what they want to do, it is what attracts them to the hobby.  And other than negotiating after losing or winning a conflict, they can do just that very easily in IAWA. It is not a bad game for them where they have to narrate one billion things.<br/><br/>Third, "loser describes how winner wins" is just not IAWA at all.  Like, that's not the game. It doesn't even much make sense.  I'm all for house rules if people like them, and these folks seemed to, but I'm not sure I would go to IAWA for that.  The only two things unique about IAWA are the owe list and negotiating having an actual gameplay framework (the stick - the threat of just bludgeoning the other person instead.)  Someone going to an IAWA game and not finding any real negotiations-with-sticks is going to be in a very similar position to someone going to a D&amp;D4 game and finding "well, we don't use 1-square shift rules".  The natural reaction is "whawhu huh?" even if everyone seems to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Fourth, IAWA can be used with NPCs to charge after the PCs if they're lagging behind a bit. They can especially be used to pick off PCs who have been hit hard.  I don't think a version in which the NPCs provide the bulk of the conflict is dysfunctional in any way, it's just VERY hard on the GM and not nearly as competitive. Actually that might be a good idea for a group of strangers who are a little shy about punching each other in the face.<br/><br/>Finally, strangers would far rather do comedy together than drama. That will never change, ever. Even if it had been played absolutely according to the book, I guarantee you would consider it a comedy.<br/><br/>By the way, I LOVE the "close your eyes and raise your hand to identify the rating" bit of the game. That is a great way to get people to state that they might be squicked out by something without feeling like they have to stand in front of everyone and say "hello I am a wimp."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258809/#Comment_258809" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T13:57:02+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  1:57PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 10:35AM by Ry.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Time to roll the dice, Ryan! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>Augh, I'm REALLY bummed to here this, but I can't fairly dissect this in public from here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258917/#Comment_258917" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T08:03:21+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  8:03AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2010 8:03AM by jessecoombs.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds awful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258921/#Comment_258921" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T08:21:22+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  8:21AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is what happen when you play IAWA thinking that "rule zero" still apply.<br/><br/>Most GMs (and players) are conditioned to think that roleplaying=rule zero.

That's the weird thing about it: I'm pretty sure I remember (if I think way back) thinking that all one-shots are kind of like that--goofy, inconclusive, just an excuse to get together and talk at each other in funny voices and make each other laugh. I was probably one of those people that said, "I only campaign play", because in my experience, that was the only way to get a meaningful story and any character development happening.<br/><br/>Now, I was only active in about 20 minutes of gameplay, since my character wasn't one of the people immediately in the first (and only) scene. I think one of the GMs framed me in as, "oh, yeah, there's also a sketchy guy watching all this from the trees." I eventually picked a moment where a player whose play I was enjoying was separated from the others (coincidentally, he was the character it was in my Best Interests to kill), and just asked if I could be present in the same room as him. We had a very enjoyable interaction where I threatened to kill him, then realized he was much stronger than me (this was established in the fiction; no dice rolled here) and started begging him to help me plead with his wife for my children's lives. I had a blast for those 20 minutes or so; it just wasn't meaningful story play. I rolled dice twice (and got onto the Owe List both times, despite winning!), once to scramble out the window (in which I was comically stuck) and then to "accidentally" bump into one of the other characters as I fell out of the window. I remember thinking, "Directly or Covertly? Why isn't there a form called 'Indirectly'?"<br/><br/>The weird thing about the game was that it wasn't all wrong. It was *this* close to being a proper game of IaWA, and then just proceeded to miss by a few degrees on each approach. For instance, the only NPC present (a demonic influence in the house, that only acted to keep people from going up or down the stairs for some reason) was rolling d10 d12, which I later told the GMs shouldn't have happened, but didn't feel comfortable bringing up in play. The whole "loser narrates outcome" thing wasn't as bad as it sounds, either: they DID know that sometimes the winner can be the Answerer, but "that pretty much never happens!"<br/><br/>I didn't get the impression that the people playing didn't understand the game--quite to the contrary (although I can't say the same for the few newbies who were there). But it was like a bunch of people playing tennis, except they were all holding their rackets in the wrong hand.<br/><br/>It was so close to right, and yet so far...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258927/#Comment_258927" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T09:19:47+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  9:19AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I think this is what happen when you play IAWA thinking that "rule zero" still apply.</blockquote>\nRule zero always applies no matter what, it will apply no matter what anyone says, forever, but some applications are good ideas and some are bad ideas and some are neither good nor bad but just puzzling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258929/#Comment_258929" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T09:24:12+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  9:24AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys obviously have different definitions of "Rule Zero"...

Without needing any "rules".<br/><br/>"Rule zero" is WITHHOLDING that right from every single participant in the game, apart one. It says "the GM is the ONLY one who decide. You can't participate in that decision". This means, literally, that the GM become the system, and it's "above the shared rules".  In this scenario, the rules CAN'T CHANGE, because the GM is the same, and he will always decide in the same way.<br/><br/>LOOK, please, LOOK at that first post, instead of telling the usual "theory" about "rule zero = change". In reality, In ACTUAL PLAY, rule zero means NO CHANGE. It means ALWAYS PLAYING THE SAME GAME. It means buying new games and playing them exactly like the old ones! It means PLAYING ALWAYS THE SAME GAME. It's the most powerful factor against innovation in this hobby.<br/><br/>Sorry for the tone, but I really have no patience with "theories" that contradict what everybody see every day...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258994/#Comment_258994" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T18:59:06+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  6:59PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>No, "rule zero" isn't the possibility to change the rules.

The text then instructs GMs to kill players with a shovel if they try to get them to follow the rules: "...those players who are going to want to follow every rule to the letter. The easiest way to deal with them is with a shovel..."  Page 210 has more gems like "At least try to look like you're being fair."<br/><br/>Do you want a more famous game?<br/>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, Dungeon Masters Guide page 110: "You [The GM] do have every right to overrule the dice at any time if there is a particular course of events that you would like to have occur." <br/><br/>Something more recent?<br/><br/>From the Moongoose edition of Runequest:<br/>"The Games Master, <b>using the rules in this book as a<br/>guideline</b>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">decides</span> what effect any actions undertaken<br/>by the Player Characters have.

There are a lot of D&amp;D lovers on there that want to get out and game, but when presented with more indie style games wherein they have to help narrate and make the story, they freeze up and sit there, dawdling until they GM interferes. I say this because I've run several games for these folks, and god bless them, they're getting better. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will not say all gamers are people who freeze up when the buck is passed to them. I will say most of the TAG folks are used to mainstream and haven't yet figured out what the indie scene is all about. But I will say they're interested, but need to be eased into it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs one of the GMs that regularly runs games through the website, I won't deny dismal sadness at some games when they latched on to every narration as "There's a tunnel the GM mentioned, let's go down it because it must be important!" to just having their characters mill around until I gave them fodder. They did much better with direction, but then again, I wasn't surprised by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best advice for running/playing indie games with those folks is to make it fun, exciting and emphasize certain things. Then... push them when they need it.

That, by itself, would not be a problem. Everybody can believe what he want  (I am Italian: I see every day ample proof that people can believe ANYTHING, no matter the evidence). The problem is that you continue to interrupt every thread where someone cite rule zero, jumping "in the fray" to defend her from anybody who would like to say that it isn't the best rule in the world.  And, to push your point, you spout absolute nonsense as the idea that rule zero is player-empowering or that doesn't give any special authority to the GM on the rules or that "every game has it".<br/><br/>"It is absolutely absurd to say that a rule that supports customization means less variety in games."????. Where did you live in the '90, on the moon? Rule Zero caused a decade long stagnation in game design ("system does not matter") that stopped only when it was rejected by newer, better designs.<br/><br/>But, as I said, you are free to believe in every delusional nonsense you want. The problem is that you don't have enough respect for the other people who are trying to talk about other things.  The other guy at least debated the point using whispers. You could have started another thread, if you really wanted play again the Paladin of Rule Zero in public. But no, you prefer to derail THIS thread. Obviously, seeing that this thread talk about some "rule zero" habit/damage that made a couple of GM incapable of understanding a game without it, you are invested in stopping or derailing this discussion.<br/><br/>Seeing that you have absolutely no intention of respecting the topic, I will simply ignore any other post from you.

I certainly didn't mean it that way (joking about Ryan aside).<br/><br/>I've had a positive experience with the TAG group so far (and I'm very impressed with the way it's run), and last Thursday night was my first event, which I thought was great. I met a bunch of nice people, made some new friends, and had a good time in general.<br/><br/>However, I found their approach to this particular game really, well, unusual. Given the discussion we had about IaWA recently, with some people having trouble running it successfully (which includes one game I ran last summer with D&amp;D players), I thought I'd share it. My focus on it is one of curiosity, not criticism. Note that I didn't try to "fix" their way of playing (with which they may be entirely happy), nor tell them they were doing "it" wrong. And I don't plan on it, unless they ask me.<br/><br/>I also posted about because the game made me reflect on my own roleplaying history, and the role of the word "roleplaying", as used by many gamers outside the internet community of "enlightened" theory-oriented gamers. I've usually heard it as a shorthand for "using player intelligence to solve difficult situations"--e.g. thinking your way through a puzzle, outsmarting an NPC without rolling dice, etc. But I realized as a result of this game that for a lot of people it means "using description and dialogue to bring my character to life", and that furthermore, there is a very specific "skill" to this that is practiced over years of play. The skill part is not just bringing your character to life and entertaining fellow players but also doing so <i>without impacting the plot in any way</i>. <br/><br/>I see people who have been trained into "good roleplaying practice" as a matter of entertaining dialogue, etc, but also carefully staying away from any significant actions within the story. Because years of play where the GM provides the story have taught those people that "speaking in a funny voice" enhances the game for everyone, whereas "taking action through my character in a dramatic fashion" tends to increase frustration as the GM then has to rein the players back into the planned Plot. In this style of play, I only see truly dramatic character actions been taken when it has become clear that there is "plot-sanctioned" or "GM-sanctioned" moment for that kind of action. You often see some kind of clear signal from the GM that <i>this is the moment where you can do something significant</i>, and then a pointed look at the player in question.<br/><br/>So my hypothesis is that long-term play of this type makes people really hesitant to push the story along. Perhaps that's why "traditional" RPG discussion is usually heavily focused on things like, "How can I do a good Orcish accent better?" and "How can I use props to make my characters more memorable?" Whereas in this community those things... well, they don't come up so much. I've played with quite a few story gamers/indie gamers who use game systems to crank out story and impact each other, and have next to zero interest in the particulars of description or portrayal. (Of course, this is not true of everyone--I'm just saying *some* people.) That contrast is striking to me. Very striking.<br/><br/>My first game of IaWA went very poorly because I narrated a bunch of properly motivated, at-odds characters into a dramatic situation, and then watched as the players did everything in their power to forestall conflict. <br/><br/>I posted this account partially as a matter of curiosity. But mostly I want to see if what I'm seeing and thinking is familiar to you other folks out there, or whether I'm imagining things that aren't true. Memory can be so fickle!<br/><br/>In any case, I didn't mean to offend anyone--that's just my quirky sense of humour coming through. I can see, though, how Kate and Ryan might take this as some kind of dig at them, and I want to assure you two that it's not the case. I'm just using it as an opportunity for some humour. Because I don't think there's anything here for anyone to be upset about. Playing a game differently from the way it's written is no crime, it hurts no one. And I spent a good evening with those folks, even if the way that particular session went might not be something I would want to include in my regular gaming life.<br/><br/>This is also a problem of the internet: I think if I was recounting this in person you'd see from my facial expression that I'm just saying, "Hey, guys! I met this bunch of people and they were cool and all, but *check out how they played this game*! What do you think of that? Let's chat about it." And I'm saying that with a smile, because it's fun to talk about gaming and learn how to play games better, not because I'm hurt or upset or worried or disgusted. I hope this all makes sense--it's possible that me throwing words at this over the internet is making me less clear rather than more clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259032/#Comment_259032" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T22:01:21+00:00" title="February 27, 2010 10:01PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan and Kate,<br/><br/>And, of course, most importantly, we need to hang and talk and maybe play some games over a few beers or a few cups of coffee.

I remember running Dread that turned into a B-movie story with PVP being more important than the actual horror. But... I just went with it. I'm glad you had fun though! <br/>\n<br/>\nI do also agree that a lot of people aren't comfortable with shared narration and trying to make it a good story as a team instead of working on their own character. I find with some people that are used to playing more mainstream games, it becomes difficult to jump right into the role of story teller rather than playable character. I'm hoping to get some more shared narrative games going in TAG to strengthen that theme of learning to narrate and 'go with the flow'.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me awhile to get folks comfortable even just narrating their own actions instead of me explaining how they succeeded or failed. Gamers can evolve and while it takes time, I'm excited to see more people coming out for indie games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259035/#Comment_259035" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T22:06:51+00:00" title="February 27, 2010 10:06PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great!

Because years of play where the GM provides the story have taught those people that "speaking in a funny voice" enhances the game for everyone, whereas "taking action through my character in a dramatic fashion" tends to increase frustration as the GM then has to rein the players back into the planned Plot. In this style of play, I only see truly dramatic character actions been taken when it has become clear that there is "plot-sanctioned" or "GM-sanctioned" moment for that kind of action. You often see some kind of clear signal from the GM that<i>this is the moment where you can do something significant</i>, and then a pointed look at the player in question.</blockquote>\nTHIS I can definitely get behind, (despite my above finger-wagging about some players liking to influence the fiction strictly through their character). And really, what you're talking about here is the frequency of these moments. Some come from an experience where these moments are few and far between (hell, in organized module play, you may never experience one).  Some come from an experience where they are more common, but still not constant (here I am thinking of games which replicate very strictured genres, like Westerns, comic books, etc.  You probably have "a moment" in every conflict, but that's about it.)  Then there are those that want an experience where they happen all the time, where they are disappointed if something happens and they didn't get to put a spoon in the stew (here I am thinking of situations where the PCs are prime movers, like Dogs in the Vineyard, or a lot of sandbox play).  It can make a big difference!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259143/#Comment_259143" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T18:29:21+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  6:29PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>That's a good point!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259170/#Comment_259170" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T00:48:07+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 12:48AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>And, of course, most importantly, we need to hang and talk and maybe play some games over a few beers or a few cups of coffee.

People often talk about "system mastery" when referring to traditional games like D&amp;D, knowing the rules inside and out so that you optimize a character and increase your potential power within the game.  The same sort of thing can apply to all sorts of indie games, but not quite in the same way.  Instead of knowing what feats you should take for your character, you need to learn how to write Best Interests for your character that will help drive the story; basically, it's about knowing how best to increase the potential of the story that will be created.  Many indie games, I've found, tend to require a certain intuitive understanding that really only comes through a lot of play and discussion, and IaWA is no different.  Not only that, but different people can (and will) understand these games in different ways, and thus you encounter the sort of situation that you did.<br/><br/>Now, you came here to talk about all this, but did you talk with the other players about this?  Barring comments during the game, that is.  Perhaps they'd be interested in hearing your ideas.  Obviously, it's something you'd have to approach carefully, but if you're interested in helping these players get the most out of the game, then perhaps you should see if they're willing to discuss it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259194/#Comment_259194" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T05:28:47+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for chiming in, Mike.<br/><br/>What you're talking about is exactly what surprised me about this game: most of the people playing said they've been playing for quite a while, on a regular basis.

And yes, I now regret my actions. Not so much my actions in the game as a host, but rather my actions as a host to fail to prepare Paul for the type of gaming experience I typically offer in the way of an IAWA one-shot. <br/>\n<br/>\nPaul has been a recent member of Toronto Area Gamers (the meetup.com group) and I do value his ideas, which he has been kind enough to share on our message board. I hope to learn more, and I hope that others also engage in the discussion. To that end I have asked Paul if he will open a discussion with me on meetup to address how I could have better managed expectations for this gaming experience. If you are interested and are a member (or choose to become a member) I hope that you can bring some great ideas on how to build a gaming community. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose here is where I should get down to brass tacks and plead for my life as a gaming host. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe my main failure as a host was to address light-narrative play vs. system demonstration play. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning I am going to simply offer a mea culpa for errors in system based play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been running RPG's since I was a teenager (as I'm sure many of us have) and I have never had a head for systems and rules. While I do realize that some players derive their fun from trying to beat the system, work the system, or crunch the system... keeping track of the permutations of conflict resolution is something that ruins my play experience as a player and that I have even less skill at as a GM. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been running games with Toronto Area Gamers for three years now, and I think I entered a comfort zone where I felt it was "known" that I am a GM that tosses out the rule book on each and every occasion. What I failed to take into account was that since our group is growing (up from 75 active members in December 2008 to 325 members in December 2009) that I should have resumed my old habit of making it explicitly clear that I am a 'rule-light' to 'no-rules' GM. My failure to do so certainly failed to prepare Paul for situations where I was unclear on the actual rules and put little stock in making implementing the system rules as it pertained to the correct sequence (initiative included - I still have no idea where that goes!!! ack .... see haven't learned my lesson) for conflict resolution. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy second failure... although I do hesitate to call it a failure... lets call it a short coming instead is my lack of confidence and experience as a GM. Despite having run games since highschool I much prefer the player experience. I run one shots for TAG because I am an Assistant Organizer, and keeping an active organization is a large reason for our growth. I eagerly look forward to the day when we have enough members running one-shots and I can worry about things like accounting, website registration and then go enjoy some games as a player. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I would like to host sometimes... less than I do now... but sometimes. And, to do that it would be good if I took this opportunity over this IAWA feedback to pull out some learning opportunities. Up front, I'm never going to learn the system, in campaigns I designate a 'rules lawyer' and that person is responsible in my campaigns for knowing the rules and navigating the system when we need one (which  I try to avoid as much as possible). <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my learning opportunities here are to enhance the narrative. Paul is correct the narrative in this one-shot was weak as compared to campaign narratives, I'm at a bit of a loss however, on how this could have been enriched with given reasonable planning constraints.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say reasonable plannning constraints I mean this isn't a convention one-shot, nor is it a regular campaign with consistent players, so I'm not inclined to put a significant amount of pre-preparation into it. One reason I run it is that I can basically take it out and set it up like a board game rather than the preparation of NPC generation and plot points that would be needed for a more structured system. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued below...<br/>\n<br/>\nBeagleSmuggler<br/>\n(ask Sara M - AO - Toronto Area Gamers)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler" title="BeagleSmuggler"><img alt="BeagleSmuggler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler">BeagleSmuggler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260684/#Comment_260684" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T09:54:04+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  9:54AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 9:59AM by BeagleSmuggler.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            continued from above...<br/><br/>So lets get down to the nitty-gritty and ask some questions, clear up some facts and find some solutions!<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>They organized the game via an online Meetup.com event, which meant guests RSVP and then show up. Six people were supposed to be there. A big group, to my eyes, but, hey, why not? Sounds like a fun challenge.</blockquote>\nThis is an interesting observation for me. I have always been lead to believe that my six players for IAWA was a fairly conservative number as compared to most people who were playing. I've always felt a bit bad for limiting to this small of a number. What are the experiences here with a standard group size for this game?\n<blockquote>For whatever reason, shortly after people started arriving, the number grew to<i>nine</i>. I was wondering, "how is this going to go?" I can't remember the last time I played a game with nine people. Yikes! And we only had about two or two and a half hours.</blockquote>\nYup, I should have thought that one through. One reason that I don't apologize for my gaming style (no rules) is that I do get a lot of returning players who do seem to have enjoyed themselves. Another consideration with the 9 people was that unfortunately with many meetup.com events there are often (most of the time) people who RSVP 'yes' and then don't show up to the event. This can be a particular problem when it's a small group. So, I generally err on the side of letting people who request to 'come anyways' do so on the assumption that some of the people who said they would show up will not... this obviously did not work out this time. <br/><br/>Some details on the group that may help to evaluate why some decisions were made:<br/><br/>While I'm not sure that any of us actually did describe IAWA as our 'main' or 'number-one' game there were six of nine people who had played it several times before. The remaining three were completely new to the game. One of the new players who had been brought by one of the experienced players had specifically requested to either be given a very minor character or to only observe the game - hopefully this addresses the issue of why one character was playing a bird with very little in the way of integrated best interests. \n<blockquote>The two GMs began to introduce the game, making a big point of how this was a "narrative-based game", and not your typical RPG. "There are some dice involved, but we very rarely roll them. You only roll if you want to roll, as you'll see." "We brainstorm characters and create the plot together before we play." I found this disclaimer interesting.</blockquote>\nI'm sorry. I will try to put better explanations of this in my game descriptions rather than in the in-person introduction. \n<blockquote>Next, another unusual procedure: the GMs had everyone close their eyes, and then announced different movie ratings: "PG-13!" "NC-17!" etc. We were supposed to raise our hand if the rating being named was the highest level we wanted to handle explicitly in the game. Someone chose "PG-13", so that was our cutoff, in terms of game content. (For the record, all the players were adults)</blockquote>\nOkay, here's a question for the board. <br/><br/>Until about 3 months ago I never did this. Then, when running a couple of one-shots a few of the female players came to me afterwards and expressed some discomfort with the graphic details that the narrative had taken. I had a discussion with them and some other TAG GM's and this idea of asking people to either blind vote on paper, or blind vote with hands was offered as a solution. <br/><br/>For a campaign I would clear comfort levels with people prior to the campaign, for a one-shot I think it's important to do that every time since people's comfort levels are different with strangers. An adult who may be comfortable with sexualized themes and narratives in a regular group may feel very uncomfortable with them in a group with people they have never met. <br/><br/>My goal is to have all of my players feel comfortable with the narrative and my expectation is that unless I advertise the game as an NC-17 game that players who are comfortable with NC-17 will not have their play experience ruined by having to play PG-13 but if you switch that around the person who is only comfortable with PG-13 will feel badly and maybe not return to the game or the entire group if they find themselves in NC-17 play. <br/><br/>In the end two players chose PG-13, one player later let me know that the reason for their choice was that at the time of voting there was a child under the age of 10 present in the room (she was picked up by a parent shortly thereafter, but this player did not realize that was going to happen - I could have mentioned that and did not - communications failure on my part). Even if this player had changed their mind I don't know the reason for the other players vote (didn't ask) but would have stuck by it. <br/><br/>I was disappointed that the Blood and Sex Oracle did get binned as a result, personally I think it can be part of PG-13 play, but I have always felt in the minority on that score. Glad to know I have some company for liking that oracle. \n<blockquote>We spent a good deal of time banging out Best Interests (with a fair bit of success), using a "conflict map". People seemed to find a lot of glee in the messy picture that resulted, even though we didn't really ever refer to that page after we began playing. Then players were instructed to take some time to write a physical description of their character on their sheets (this gave several players pause, and took a while), even though we were never prompted in any way to describe our characters in play.</blockquote>\nThe 'conflict map' is something that I got from a friend, which I think is a great tool for players to create plot. Since plot generally involves points of conflict (not always physical) this is a visual demonstration to players of putting that into practice. I'd be more than open to other tools. But, as I mentioned I borrowed this one and I don't think of myself as someone who is good at generating these kinds of tools. <br/><br/>I try to use the "develop a character description" time as a period for players to begin to transition between the set up of the game where they (ideally) took ownership of the macro-plot and for them now to focus in on their own character and how they want that character to look, act and feel as a character moving the plot rather than as an abstract tool of the plot. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the "lets all describe ourselves now" scene, that I have all too often come across in games. What tools have you used to encourage players to volunteer character descriptions without a too-heavy-handed "okay tell everyone what you look like" device?<br/><br/><br/>\n<blockquote>The first difficulty that arose was that many players were asking, "Do I know so-and-so? How long have I been doing X?" The GMs responded that you can just decide whatever you like, and not worry about background details. "You can narrate anything you want. Only, if you disagree with something someone else says, you can roll dice against them." The GMs explained that you could roll dice against another player if you disagreed about something. Note: not characters disagreeing, but players disagreeing.<br/><br/>Example from play: "Have we signed the deed yet?" "I thought we had." "No, I think it's better if we're still waiting to sign it." "But the card we drew said, 'deed, signed and sealed'!" "Do you guys want to roll dice over this?"</blockquote>\nOops! I really don't remember saying this, and would like to think that if I did I intended it in sarcasm - although if I did it was failed attempt. I fully agree that dice should only be used to settle character-to-character disagreements which cannot be settled via narration. <br/><br/>The line that I usually try to use is the "no you don't!" line....<br/><br/>"In this game you have the freedom (and need to because you are in control of the plot - not the GM) to narrate anything you like, we go to dice when one player narrates a character action that your character would not agree with. The best example of this is if Player A says "I run up behind Player B and stab him in the back", if player A and B cannot narrate a solution that they both agree with, and we will presume they can't since Player A wants his character to stab Player B's character, then Player B would say "no you don't!" and a dice resolution would be used to help the scene narration by giving direction on which character has the upper hand in the conflict based on the dice results"...\n<blockquote> In response to inactivity, the GMs started to introduce the other characters into the scene one by one, but without introducing conflict. e.g. "Oh, yeah, while you're talking, you see there's a red-haired woman across the street who can see you."</blockquote>\nHere is where I may need some direction on this issue. I often find that this is the main hurdle to jump for a new IAWA group, experienced or inexperienced. I am under the impression (correct me if I'm wrong) that in this style of game the role of the GM is to prompt characters to narrate details into a scene and initiate conflict themselves. This of course is very different from a standard RPG where players are often on a track laid out by the GM. In this case the GM is trying to avoid building the track, but is then needs to find ways to subtly prompt players for "wouldn't this be a good time for your character to notice something of interest..."<br/><br/>If I am not completely off base on the above what are some good tactics to use for this?<br/><br/><br/>Continued below...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler" title="BeagleSmuggler"><img alt="BeagleSmuggler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler">BeagleSmuggler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260685/#Comment_260685" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T09:54:59+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  9:54AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 10:00AM by BeagleSmuggler.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            continued from above...\n<blockquote>However, it reminded me of gaming in past years, where I seem to remember feeling that this was what<i>roleplaying was all about</i>. In other words, the GM provides plot, and the players provide Color and laughs by portraying their characters. Roleplaying = talking in funny voices, Rollplaying = rolling dice to fight things. Everything else ("story") is the territory of the GM. It seems to me that in this game, without the GMs injecting story, everyone was a little lost, and my own failed game a year ago was a fumble for the same reason.<br/><br/>My question is:<br/><br/>Am I remembering correctly? Are a lot of gamers out there kind of conditioned to expect and enjoy contributing to a game purely by character-portrayal? And become paralyzed or confused when the burden of moving along the plot falls on them? Or is my memory playing tricks on me?<br/><br/>I also seem to remember that those gamers who were considered "great roleplayers" were sometimes people who learned to break up this tedium by throwing their characters into wacky, unexpected situations, creating thereby surprise and conflict. But, in IaWA, it seems to me that everyone has to do this. To enter any scene with a clear direction for the character. And to push for their desires. But it seemed that in this game, people really were just so used to merely acting out dialogue or non-essential actions ("I take a piece of the bush and braid it into a hat for my pet donkey!") that this was not a comfortable thing for them.<br/><br/>I'm curious to hear what you think.</blockquote>\nI think this goes partially to my own lack of confidence as a GM and partly to the relative lack of familiarity that players have with these types of systems. Even those of us who I will describe as experienced IAWA players has played less than 10 individual sessions over the span of 3 years. <br/><br/>I agree that it is a poor role playing experience where players only add colour and do not share in the story creation and direction, more so in a narrative based system. <br/><br/>The question is how to accustom players to taking control of the story. Some do it naturally while others do seem quite lost, some even seem put out by having this asked of them (I call them D&amp;D players - I had to get a snipe in there at D&amp;D somewhere).<br/><br/>I find the challenge, especially with a group like TAG where the vast majority of members are coming from systems based role play (for lack of a better term) they tend to sit back and wait for the GM to prompt and obstacle to their collective objective and in many cases view it as bad or aggressive play to take on another PC. They are in many ways looking for permission to take the reigns. <br/><br/>I consider the first signs that they are willing to do that the rather off the wall first attempts at narrative that do pop out in a one-shot. In the one and only longer term IAWA game (a full 6 sessions) I was part of players after the initial discovery that they can take control of the direction of the plot by adding in details they quickly became more comfortable and bolder, and would then start to push other characters, once that happened a time or two then everyone became comfortable that you were not going to insult any player by pushing their character into a conflict scene and plots began moving, overarching themes developed and favourite characters began returning. <br/><br/>I think the second form that we would both like to see is true narrative gaming, but I think that many players need to transition through narrative-light by learning to narrate consequences rather than having them handed down by the GM before they feel confident in narrative. I could be wrong... but I can't for the life of me figure out how - without a group of players very accustom to each other - this stronger narrative could be fostered in a one-shot. Ideas?<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Thanks for your time, and I hope that we can trade some ideas on how to create better narratives and tools to prompt new players in narrative games. I'll eventually take a deep breath and read through the comments.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed having Paul in my game, he is a creative and talented player and I hope to see much more of him in TAG games. <br/><br/>BeagleSmuggler<br/>(aka SaraM - Assistant Organizer Toronto Area Gamers)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260694/#Comment_260694" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T10:47:51+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 10:47AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BeagleSmuggler</cite>I have been running games with Toronto Area Gamers for three years now, and I think I entered a comfort zone where I felt it was "known" that I am a GM that tosses out the rule book on each and every occasion.</blockquote>\nI would like to ask you something about this.

We've been communicating a little bit by e-mail, but now we can chat "in the open", which I hope might clear up matters for anyone who might have been reading but did not post. I've already thanked you for hosting a great evening, and just generally being wonderful in helping people get together, have fun, and make friends, but let me do so again here, now that I know you're reading this!<br/><br/>I really regret making the post that started this thread now, as I didn't think so many people would have been affected by it. That was a stupid assumption on my part, and I am well aware that I owe any offended parties an apology. Reading through my own posts, above, I don't feel like I've insulted anyone, but the subject line could certainly be read as offensive, especially by anyone who doesn't know me well in real life (I like to make light-hearted fun of life in general). And, of course, that subject line must colour any reader's interpretation of the text that follows, so that was another mistake on my part.<br/><br/>It is very common on Story Games for people to discuss things they didn't enjoy or understand in each others' games, and often to do so humorously, so I was posting in that vein without considering that some feelings might be hurt. (I actually didn't know that any TAG members read Story Games, except for a couple of people I know personally.)<br/><br/>I had a great time during the game, met lots of fun people, and was very impressed with the way the event was put together and run. Sara was absolutely fantastic in terms of organizing, hosting, providing snacks (and delicious ones!), and making sure everyone was comfortable and got to participate in the game. I said this above, but I want to say it again just to be really, really clear. Running a game for a mix of strangers and friends, in a large group, with varying levels of experience, and in a short time frame, is a huge, huge challenge, and Sara handled it amazingly well. And I'm not using the word "amazingly" lightly, here. Like, I was seriously impressed--and I know I could never have pulled that off with that level of success. And while I'm talking mostly about human-person-type skills, which you have in spade-loads, Sara, your participation in the game as a roleplayer/GM was also very skillful, and contributed to the fun of the game immensely.<br/><br/>More importantly, Sara, you can't and shouldn't be taking any blame for a bad game experience on yourself. First of all, it wasn't a bad game experience at all: I was merely commenting that this group of people played the game in a very different way, one that contrasts how I view the game. There's no value judgement there. Indeed, if the way the game ran was the desired outcome (which, for all I know, it was), then it was a resounding success.<br/><br/>(Given that you and several of the players actually have more experience playing IaWA than I do, it might be quite fair to say that I'm the one whose approach to the game is not quite right! I participate in this forum largely out of curiosity in the diversity of play-styles, and I like learning about different ways to play and enjoy games. I don't think it's a matter of right and wrong, but a matter of appreciating diversity. The more ways we have to play different games, the more people can have fun playing them. In my mind, that's the whole basis of this story game/indie game/hippy game community, and the very thing that drew me to it: a celebration of a variety of gaming styles rather than a pledge to administer the One True Way.)  <br/><br/>More importantly, in a game with nine people and all participating more or less equally (and you did a fantastic job helping that happen!), we are all equally responsible for what happens, good and bad. It doesn't matter who's a GM and who isn't. We were all playing together, and making it happen: you, me, and everyone else at the table. (For instance, you know some of the things you quoted me as saying, but don't remember saying yourself? Those were probably things the other GM said. Or even one of the other players sharing their knowledge of the game with the group. We were all participating, and thus all share the joys and burdens of the resulting fun or lack of fun together. As I see it, that's how we become friends--by building together and sharing our successes and failures.)<br/><br/>You also communicated the style and feel of the game very well, contrary to what you may be thinking now. The "movie rating" scheme was very slick and well administered. I think it's a great tool--I was just surprised to see it in a game of IaWA, which has so many "adult" themes built into it. But it's good technique, and you applied it in the right context for all the right reasons, which is awesome.<br/><br/>If I had felt that I had been offered one thing and then given a different thing, I would have had said something. But, no: I think you were really clear and upfront about the style and tone of the game, as well as your preferred style of GMing/play. This is another rare thing in the gaming community that you deserves huge kudos for. <br/><br/>Everything from the presentation to the "movie ratings" technique made it very clear what kind of game we were in for, and I think as a group we were all agreed on what we were doing that evening, even if some of us (like you and I) might have, say, wished we could have included the Blood &amp; Sex oracle. But we went with what was best for the group, and I think this was a very good thing. So, I'm not saying, "Look how stupid! PG-13 In a Wicked Age." I'm saying, "Hey, look! I played in a PG-13 version of In a Wicked Age..., and here's how it went down. What do you think?" I thought it was pretty cool, personally. I was actually surprised at how well the system can be suited to slapsticky play. That's another tool I'll be adding to my toolbelt!<br/><br/>So, the only reason I posted here on Story Games is because:<br/><br/>a) I was surprised by how different this game was from my previous experiences playing IaWA (with the exception of that one session I ran myself). This in itself is an interesting thing to discuss. How do different people play different games?<br/>b) I wanted to share my perception of this play style with the community, to see if I was crazy and seeing ghosts where there were none, or if certain player behaviours were a common thing in the wider gaming world.<br/>b) It would also be great to see if we can prod and pull some good techniques to communicate different styles of play.<br/><br/>I wouldn't worry too much about the rules stuff: if you're happy playing the way you're playing, then keep on keepin' on, right? If you're not, well, we're playing in a game together on Saturday, and we can compare notes and see if we have some good tips for each other.<br/><br/>The only real reason I brought up rules comments at all here is because a huge proportion of the posters are game designers, and are always interested in seeing how people play their games and how their rules are interpreted out "in the wild". So, it's usually interesting to discuss these details--I, for one, don't believe there's anything inherently good or bad about following the letter of the rules or doing what you like, instead. So, there's no problem there. I was just trying to supply some more information to game designers, of which there are many, many, many on this forum. I *think* that they appreciate this kind of information. I know that if a bunch of people I didn't know about were playing one of my games, I'd love to hear what they were doing with them.<br/><br/>Most importantly, though:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BeagleSmuggler</cite><br/>Thanks for your time, and I hope that we can trade some ideas on how to create better narratives and tools to prompt new players in narrative games.

Personally I'm grateful for this little flash in the pan, I had no idea this forum even existed and it looks like one that I will really enjoy getting to know. And, I've learned that a number of our members are already participants here - which to me means that Toronto Area Gamers is attracting a high level of engaged players who are looking to build great play experiences. <br/><br/>I have to admit I only heard about this thread through the grape vine and when I came here to read it I was prepared to read the worst, and was quite happy to find that the account was well thought out and left lots of room for me to ask my own "how could I have made this better" questions. I love the fact that I think this attitude of 'lets work together to make gaming better' can exist in this space and I hope that any TAG members who re-read this thread can re-read your original post in that spirit. <br/><br/>A true Canadian trait, I feel the need to instantly apologize if I think I've inconvenienced anyone. I'm glad that areas which I was worried were unclear (i.e. style of play, rating system) were actually positively received. This is only the second time in the four months that I've now been using the rating system that I've had any feedback on it at all aside from people who asked that I implement it. <br/><br/>I agree that it is definitely a cooperative game so the speed at which the narrative picks up and manages to help itself along is a collective responsibility, still in a one-shot where people are 'trying the game on' I do feel that as the host I should develop some tools to help players who are struggling with that. <br/><br/>I think this is where your objectives laid out above are very important. We would be able to have a much more informed discussion on how different people play this game, if this was a common stumbling block and what tools people used to get around it if this were D&amp;D on virtually any gaming forum, however since it's IaWA - there's less knowledge and therefore a forum called Story Games seems like an ideal place to go for that advice. (I will make sure to go read through those comments soon!)\n<blockquote>There is definitely a certain outlook necessary to get the most out of this game, and I suspect it applies to many other story games, as well. How can we help people put their finger on that faster and more easily?</blockquote>\nThis is the crux of the question for me. Those of us who have been playing narrative games for awhile know what a good narrative game feels like, but for me (and I it looks like for Paul as well) sometimes there is a lot of trouble conveying that to people that are new to the systems. To avoid things like players floundering when they are expected to pick up the plot direction and run with it, what tools do you use? (You being the collective community here, not putting all the pressure on Paul). <br/><br/>Finally thanks for the welcome to the forums Paul, I look forward to seeing you Saturday for an awesome home brew game using Mutants and Masterminds - kind of... sort of (Sara, apologizes to all the game designers on this forum who have agonized over systems that I have never bothered to read...

To my memory no one tried to 'enhance' their character by 'speaking in funny voices'. This is a pet peeve of mine, and I think could be taken as devaluing of the attempts that players did make to bring whatever dimension was brought into their characters.<br/><br/>2. As many people have pointed out a significant portion of the TAG membership is D&amp;D gamers, followed by other system gamers (White Wolf, WOD, and Traveler) although I was hoping that we were seeing some growth in the narrative end, I suppose that remains to be seen. The thing I struggle with the most is simply getting the characters to first describe their own actions, then describe consequences... it a learning experience for almost everyone. <br/><br/>3. I feel like we are being made out to be experts that we are not. The folks who attended and who have played IaWA before have mostly learned from Ryan's initial five or six sessions way back in 2007, and a few of the others had simply played a time or two at a con. All in all none of us has played this game more than 10 times, and most not more than 3. <br/><br/>Keeping all of the above in mind I have the following broad general goals when I run IaWA (or any other narrative / indie) games. <br/><br/>1. To introduce people to indie and narrative games as a viable option when compared to more mainstream published games, to bring awareness to the industry and create an environment that will have people consider branching out from mainstream. <br/><br/>2. To introduce the idea that there are games that don't run on rails. That players can and should be able to have a stake in the game and the story and more than that can actually fully direct it. <br/><br/>With those broad goals and knowing that I am for the most part dealing with an audience that will ask me "what do I need to roll to fire uphill in a rainstorm" I generally try to praise and encourage the following behaviour on the assumption that these are the basics of developing narrative gaming comfort level and if these start to emerge then narrative play can deepen in future sessions.<br/><br/>1. Describe your actions, don't just roll the dice and look to me to tell you what happened based on a number. <br/><br/>2. Become comfortable narrating consequences, the dice tell you that you have not lost this conflict but that the other player's character has the upper hand, what does that look like?<br/><br/>Realistically in a one-shot I'm happy if those things are achieved, I may be setting my expectations low, but I'm not sure how to raise them to the next steps without making it a game that is not friendly to newbies, which is the purpose of a one-shot (well for me at least). <br/><br/>3. Learn how to advocate for your character and your characters interests, don't sit back and wait for the GM to make something 'happen' to your character. <br/><br/>4. Challenge others into counter point positions so that plot must move forward, create scenes and situations where other characters are forced to 'deal' with your character. <br/><br/>5. Raise the level of narration by increasing description of scene, setting and action and how they interrelate. <br/><br/>So this is the membership from where I find players and these are the goals I have for introducing indie play, any suggestions on how they could could be altered for higher success?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler" title="BeagleSmuggler"><img alt="BeagleSmuggler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler">BeagleSmuggler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260774/#Comment_260774" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T15:07:40+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  3:07PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>1. The GMs instructed us that whatever forms we chose, we had to stick to narrating within those forms for the entire conflict. I pointed out that this was not entirely how I think the game is supposed to be played, since it can limit the natural development of conflicts. The more knowledgeable GM explained, however, that they were more interested in how the text was written, and following that faithfully, than in playing the game the way the designer intended. Well, fair enough: I was the newcomer, so I kept mum. To my relief, though, this rule was never enforced.<br/><br/>2. In group conflicts, everyone made a big point of organizing the involved parties into two sides, "OK, so it's so-and-so with so-and-so, against character B and C. Anyone want to support either side?" If someone on the opposite side of the conflict had bigger dice than you, then you would go on the Owe List after the first round. They didn't seem to see that it was actually important that you ROLL against that person, since they would determine this before the dice ever hit the table and Challenges were announced (when they were announced, if they were announced).<br/></cite></blockquote>\nWhat I like about the conflict resolution system in IaWA is that I don't have to flip through ten chapters of a book to determine what I need to roll to determine if my character is successful or not in hitting the other character with a given weapon and then filp through more of the book to figure out what the subsequent damage roll is if I am successful.<br/><br/>What I dislike about the IaWA conflict system is that the concept of having player to player opposed rolls in a given sequence broken up by narration is confusing for most players (myself included). In a one shot I find it easiest and yes, this is a cheat, but I really don't know how else to manage it (SUGGESTIONS WELCOME) to pause the first few times, draw some clear lines to know that all players know how they are or are not involved in the conflict and then proceed step by step. <br/><br/>When we were playing with Ryan (yes, Ryan I'm throwing you under the bus) he would walk us through this in sequence the first few times and then leave us to it. Which would lead me to believe that once the system is learned then players can apply it with more fluidity. Of course, I may be a living example that my assumption is wrong since I could neither remember if and when initiative is applied and I was under the assumption that the same forms needed to be used for the whole combat. <br/><br/>(apologizes to Ryan for being a poor IaWA student).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260775/#Comment_260775" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T15:13:10+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  3:13PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 3:14PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sara,<br/><br/>Great stuff. I think you hit all those points admirably, so you're golden there. There's also absolutely nothing wrong with saying, "This is how I like to play." If that's the case, there's no reason some jerk posting on the internet should change your opinion, and no need to defend your position. And that's why I didn't jump in and try to "fix" what was happening: as far as I was concerned, you and the group were doing exactly what you set out to do. From your description, it sounds like you succeeded totally. That's great! There are many different ways to play any game, and none are categorically good or bad.<br/><br/>It's often difficult to communicate over the internet, so let me clear up something else, as well:<br/><br/>If you look through what I've written, you'll see that I never acused anyone at the game of "speaking in a funny voice". I'm just using that as an expression, a shorthand for something I've seen in my own gaming history--so it's my issue, not yours or the group's. Besides, "speaking in funny voices" can often enhance a game, and in that capacity I strongly support it: a more generous label for it would be "acting".<br/><br/>I'm not saying you were implying that about me, necessarily--I'm just adding that to cover the bases.<br/><br/>Thank you for being so understanding (even while I was a jerk on the internet, though that was not my intention)!<br/><br/><i>edit: cross-posted with the above.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler" title="BeagleSmuggler"><img alt="BeagleSmuggler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler">BeagleSmuggler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260776/#Comment_260776" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T15:16:46+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  3:16PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Vincent">@Vincent</a> Huh.

At the beginning of the game when we described conflict I did confusingly used the term 'narrating resolution' rather than 'negotiating consequences' (will fix that) and mentioned that this was important since if it was not narrated-meaning-negotiated in a satisfying way for both characters then dice damage would happen. <br/><br/>I generally find that given the mainstream gamers I am trying to introduce to indie gaming that most are really reluctant to enter into conflict with another player character, let alone dish out damage and consequences to them. There is this belief that NPC's are the villans and PC's are the hero's that I'm trying to over come. I think this attributed to the sudden feeling of discomfort in the room. I could have and should have backed up Paul more to make this a positive "yes this is one of the fun things about narrative" I dropped the ball on that. <br/><br/>What could I do to make players more comfortable with developing consequences for other player characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler" title="BeagleSmuggler"><img alt="BeagleSmuggler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler">BeagleSmuggler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260780/#Comment_260780" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T15:36:12+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  3:36PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/jenskot">@jenskot</a> The GM is also a huge factor.

Do you think that the rules in a game should help you have more fun? If not, what is the function of the rules? And how would you call a rule that make the game LESS fun?<br/><br/>Given the rule zero conversation which I am still failing to grasp I'm not real sure how to answer this. <br/><br/>I think that rules in a game should facilitate play.<br/><br/>I also think that in many games rules hinder play as opposed to facilitating it. <br/><br/>A rule makes a game less fun for me when it is too complicated for the majority of players to remember or understand how to apply. If the players are finding themselves spending more time debating which rule is applied in what situation and how it should be applied that to me is a very boring experience. I would say that's a bad rule and whatever the majority of players can agree on should then be used for the remainder of the session, between sessions players and GM's can develop a 'house rule' to address similar situations. <br/><br/>I know that I personally am not good at understanding systems. I'm interested in player character to character interaction, story lines and plot. To that end my usual solution is to designate a 'rules lawyer' for my campaigns who will be the person who implements the system when play needs to involve resolution via the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[IaWA] Slapstick comedy and Plucky Birds - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11607/iawa-slapstick-comedy-and-plucky-birds/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[IaWA] Slapstick comedy and Plucky Birds - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11607/iawa-slapstick-comedy-and-plucky-birds/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Sara, don't mind me!

You don't want to fully play out the consequences of what-if-we-don't, before play actually starts. Something like, "If I don't get the macguffin, my sister will die" or "If I don't get the macguffin, the kingdom will fall into ruin" or whatever.  Just something that puts some teeth in failure from the jump.<br/><br/>Let me reiterate what I said earlier and I'll expand it a bit in answer to your other question:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The only two things unique about IAWA are the owe list and negotiating having an actual gameplay framework (the stick - the threat of just bludgeoning the other person instead.)</blockquote>\nNow, I don't have the book in front of me, but here's how I remember conflicts going, and someone can stop me if I stray too far.<br/><br/>You're playing along narrating until you do something that makes the other guy go "LIKE HELL YOU DO THAT", such as grabbing the magic sword away from them or blowing up their meth lab.  Probably something that's in your best interests to do.  You back up to the first step of that thing that they yelled at you about.  So I'm creeping into your house with the dynamite and you're suspiciously coming upstairs from the basement with your submachine gun.  We pick our forms.  We go through the rolling, step by step. If I don't obliterate you and you don't obliterate me the first go-round, <i>someone goes on the owe list</i>.  <br/><br/>That is very important because it means that one of us is losing against a challenge that is exactly in the narrative sweet spot of "just a tiny bit beyond their reach", which is where protagonists live.  <br/><br/>Plenty of people run IAWA as one-chapter games, which to me is like playing Monopoly but omitting buying and selling houses.  You could play the game with just jail, "Go" money and railroads but why play Monopoly at that point?  Anyway, room to disagree there. Some people may even yell and sneer at me right now for saying it.  But even in a four hour convention block, I always, ALWAYS try to get through at least two chapters so people can see how great the owe list is.  In an ongoing situation like you've got, where you're not sure who is going to show up, IAWA is frickin' IDEAL, but only because of the owe list.  The owe list is your continuity between all these different players and all these different games.  You will see the emergent fun of campaigns coming out from the energetic fun of the one-shot.  IAWA is perfect for this situation, you are not wrong about that.  But the owe list is what makes it perfect.<br/><br/>Anyway, we continue to roll and describe what we're doing, back and forth.  <i>No one sets stakes</i>, we just say what we're doing and keep on keepin' on until someone gets wiped or gives in.  <br/><br/>When that happens, the winner makes an offer to the loser, if they wish: "Hey, I can exhaust you, OR I can blow up your meth lab."<br/><br/>If the loser's meth lab is important to their best interests, they may very well say, "Screw you, I'm keeping my meth lab." and the winner says, "Fine, you're exhausted...." and on their next turn starts with, "So I'm driving a pickup truck through the front wall of your skanky ass trailer park meth house."  and now the loser has to fight off an attack <i>while exhausted</i>. <br/><br/>This is important because if you keep losing and losing, it still creates a good narrative - this guy is NOT going to go down, he's GOING to protect his meth lab, because that's in his best interest and the consequences if he doesn't keep it are dire, horribly dire, and the winner is going to continue to attack, because that's in HER best interest, and so on and so on.<br/><br/>Negotiating with a stick is the other unique thing about IAWA and it's VERY different from other narrative-passing games.  In PTA, for example, when I win a conflict with the Producer, I don't lose anything by incorporating his ideas, and I actually gain something from incorporating other players' ideas.  In IAWA, when I win, <i>I have the power</i> in the negotiation, it's not unlimited power, the loser can still say, "Nope, you injure me, but the meth lab is still mine and still standing", but winning gives you a tangible control over the story that is more fluid in "winner describes what happens" games.  The winner in IAWA doesn't decide what happens (unless they want to just injure/exhaust). The winner either exhausts or injures the loser, or the loser accepts what the winner proposes for what happens.  <i>The loser decides whether they accept the winner's offer or not.</i><br/><br/>If it's in my guy's best interest to keep his meth lab and I decide he's willing to die before he lets it go, guess what, <i>you have to kill him to get it.</i>  IAWA lets you do that and makes the ratcheting up of pressure on increasingly broken characters very mechanically evident.<br/><br/>Anyway, hope that helps you see why those rules are important (to me) and why they're great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260831/#Comment_260831" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T23:46:32+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 11:46PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 11:51PM by noclue.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Sara, you don't have anything to apologize for. IAWA has a history of thrashing GMs the first few times they take it out for a spin. It's kicked my ass a few times.<br/><br/>Jason did a pretty good job discussing the resolution system, but I thought I would break it down a little bit. <br/><br/>Firstly, the dice do not resolve anything except who can injure or exhaust the other person. It's not a resolution system; it's a coercion system. If our characters are fighting over the magic sword, the dice will not tell us who gets the sword. All, the dice will tell us is who has the advantage, and finally which one of us can injure or exhaust the other. That is the stick.<br/><br/>So, first we roll. If I get the higher roll, my dice stand and you have to answer. You reroll. Let's say my dice are still better (but I don't double you). I have the advantage. We narrate what that looks like, maybe I've got a firmer grip on the sword.<br/><br/>The next question is does someone go on the Owe List. For simplicity, let's assume we're rolling the same sized dice. So, no one is on the list.<br/><br/>The next question is a big one. Are we going to keep rolling, or do we want to negotiate. More pointedly, are you scared enough to give me something I might want more than hurting you? Maybe I say, give me the sword and this is all over, but you're all "No way!"<br/><br/>I've got the advantage. But that advantage die is fickle. We roll again and I have the higher roll, but when you pick up your dice to answer, you beat me (but don't double me). Now you have the advantage. Again we can negotiate. This time you have the stick. If I don't want to get injured or exhausted, perhaps I better offer you something that you want instead. <br/><br/>If we can't come to terms, we roll again. However, this time who ever ends up on top wins the conflict. Still, there's no resolution. The dice haven't decided who gets the sword. If you've won, you get to injure or exhaust me, unless I offer up something else you want.<br/><br/>Maybe getting the sword isn't all that important to you anymore. Now I'm all "Take the sword!

And I respect you a lot for that: it takes a lot of guts and humility.<br/><br/>However, you're really taking this too far if you're seeing this as some kind of failure on your part, and I'm not even sure what else I can say other than what I've already said to convince you of that. You organized a great event, and facilitated a fun game for nine (!) people. We all got on the same page and put together this fun slapstick romp. It was pretty clear to me that everyone enjoyed that aspect of the game. Playing IaWA as a slapstick farce is "failing the genre", yes, but that doesn't mean it was a failed evening. It would have been far worse to try to bully everyone into "playing the game right"!<br/><br/>If you think back to the evening, you'll remember (or, at least, I do) that you didn't do much talking during the game. You established the rules for the evening (and I don't mean just game rules), and then stepped out of the way and let everyone have fun, which was absolutely fantastic, and I wish more people would learn to do that as well as you did.<br/><br/>From that point on, we, the players, created something, and had a good time doing it. It wasn't a "typical" game of IaWA, but with nine people who aren't familiar with the game or the assumptions that go into the setting and style of play, no one would expect it to be. Don't let the comments ("Gosh, that sounds terrible!") get to you. I was there, and I saw people having fun, exploring a new medium. I don't think it was terrible it all. And I didn't see anyone else looking at their watch and wishing they could just get out of there, either. I spoke with a few of the players afterwards, and everyone seemed happy with what happened.<br/><br/>So, there is no "failure"--it was a definite success! I wrote about it not because I thought it was awful and I thought everyone did a terrible job, but rather because it DID work. It just worked in a way that was so different from what most people here would expect from a game of IaWA that I thought they would find it interesting to talk about. In any case, you have NOTHING to apologize for! Like, really. Nothing, nada. You rocked the house. And I hope you had a fun evening, too. Did you?<br/><br/>And, again, a lot of the things I wrote about the game (in terms of rules)--in fact, most of them--were coming from the other players who had previously played the game. Everyone was clearly enthusiastic about the game, and that's fantastic. There's nothing to complain about here, either. You get a big group together and different points of view emerge--that's human nature. It's not a case of right and wrong<br/><br/>I think that, for the future, you can just say, "Hey, by the way, this is [such-and-such game], but we like to play fast-and-loose with the rules. Is everyone cool with that?" As long as everyone's on the same page about that, everything's golden.<br/><br/>Now, I think that applying the rules a little more strictly might actually help, because in this game, unlike many other games, they're very carefully designed. If you're interested in that, you'll get a lot of great advice here in this forum, and I can clear up some of your questions in person on Saturday (at Stephen's game), which will be much much faster than typing back and forth. It may be that following the rules precisely might actually be easier and simpler than the way things worked that Thursday night--for instance, there's absolutely no need to figure out who's on whose side in this game, and doing so is tricky. So, there are some extra steps we added to the rules that night without which play will actually be simpler and faster.<br/><br/>However, it's also worth considering that they way we played the game is actually superior for those circumstances: a light-hearted game with lots and lots of participants. Instead of more "typical" hard-hitting IaWA play, we have a safer, lighter system ideal for comical relief and introducing new gamers to "unrailroaded", player-driven play. It may even be worth making "loser narrates outcome" a hard rule to encourage this kind of "safe" play. (It's also possible a different system might be more suited to what you're trying to do, without any wrangling, which would be an even easier solution--we'll talk on Saturday about that, again, since it's much easier in person.)<br/><br/>One thing I'm really glad about: I'm pretty sure that as a result of all this internet mess, you and I are going to be good friends! I'm looking forward to our game on Saturday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260882/#Comment_260882" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T06:29:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  6:29AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A comment about Best Interests:<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier upthread, the Best Interests phase, like many other things in the game was fantastic. I was really scared to see how it would pan out with nine people, but thanks to the "conflict map", some really helpful initiative from a few of the players, and great direction and advice from Sara and her co-GM, it went as smoothly as any Best Interests phase I've ever seen in IaWA.

I think that during the game, with the combined understanding of the players, we were 99% of the way there already. We'll have to wait and see if Sara wants more advice on how to play the game "by the book", or if she prefers the looser approach we adopted at the session. What do you think, Sara?<br/><br/>(This next part is for the game designers, and probably will sound like gobble-dee-gook. Don't mind this part if that's not your interest in this thread.)<br/><br/>Here is a very interesting (to me) observation about what happened in play:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Anyway, we continue to roll and describe what we're doing, back and forth.<i>No one sets stakes</i>, we just say what we're doing and keep on keepin' on until someone gets wiped or gives in.<br/></blockquote>\nMost people in "this community", if I'm allowed to say that non-ironically, have seen problems playing IaWA with players who want to "set stakes", bringing the conflict resolution aspects of the resolution upfront overtly, directly, and with violence. Hence this common advice, as you can see, italicized, above, in JDCorley's excellent summary of tips on IaWA resolution.<br/><br/>However, what makes IaWA work as conflict resolution is proper application of the Stick in the negotiation phase, where the players effectively decide whether they want to draw conflict resolution out of the action sequence that just happened, or stick to something like task resolution/hit-point loss for the loser, drawing out the conflict, and most likely leaving it unresolved for now.<br/><br/>In this game, however, players shied away from hard negotiation and rather let the loser narrate an unhappy outcome. So, in other words, the drift of play went in the opposite direction altogether: rather than trying to shoehorn "stakes"-style conflict resolution onto the IaWA dice play (which no one tried to do), the group was turning the dice play into straight-up task resolution. You and I disagree about something, someone shoves someone else, and we roll dice to see whose task is successful. The loser, then, narrates the outcome (much as the GM would in a traditional D&amp;D-type game). So, it was basically "task resolution with loser narration", which is a nice, safe way to introduce new gamers to a style of play where they get to narrate outcomes. (It almost reminded me a little bit of The Pool.) Sara lists this as one of her goals for the session, so she succeeded there 100%.<br/><br/>This is what I find really interesting about the game, actually, and something I'm hoping to discuss here. It's a concensual drift of the rules that may have been perfectly suited to the genre being created, or may have evolved in that moment, in reaction to the style of play that was emerging. (Sara, if I wrote the above in a way that was clear enough for you to understand--and it probably wasn't--would you say this is the typical way you play In a Wicked Age..., or something that happened just at that session?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260902/#Comment_260902" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T07:40:03+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:40AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>So, it was basically "task resolution with loser narration", which is a nice, safe way to introduce new gamers to a style of play where they get to narrate outcomes.</blockquote>\nAs a general method, whenever you see task resolution and a conflict (the Best Interests), you should ask yourself where the implicit conflict resolution is. In this case, unlike traditional task resolution where implicit conflict resolution is GM fiat, the conflict is resolved by the permission of the losing player - and perhaps by peer pressure from the player group / player group. Presumably, when a character or story has meet some group aesthetic requirement, then a Best Interest can be gained. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, this seems closer to the implicit way Best Interests are resolved in IaWA typically, i.e. negotiation with a stick, than by explicit conflict resolution replacing the negotiation. It just lacks the hard limit on the losing player resisting the winner. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260907/#Comment_260907" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T07:49:16+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:49AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, indeed.

In a one-shot I make more of an effort than I do in my long term campaign to actually follow the rules. As others have mentioned though, I'm focusing primarily on how to engage more mainstream players who are used to rolling a dice and having a GM narrate an outcome base on the roll in taking over that role themselves. To that end Paul's earlier comment that the game often missed by *this* much is accurate. <br/><br/>I'm going to post another question on the roll sequence - feel free to jump in there, but I though I would ask you other questions since you brought them up first.<br/><br/>The Owe List<br/><br/>My understanding of the Owe List is this:<br/><br/>1. A character ends up on the owe list, if after the first round of rolling dice (that is rolling initiative and having the loser of initiative answer those dice) the player using the lower-sided dice is not doubled by the player using the higher-sided dice. <br/><br/>2. Once a player-character is on the Owe List they can then cross their name off the owe list at any time (including the next round of conflict resolution) to gain a bonus die. <br/><br/>3. If a player-character is on the Owe List at the end of the session/chapter then in the development stages of the next session/chapter they can cross their character name off the owe list and determine what oracles are used, and also choose to bring back that character even if it is not implied in the Oracles.<br/><br/>4. A player-character can potentially do all of the third part if they have another character on the Owe list they could cross off that character but choose to bring back another instead. <br/><br/>Two Chapters<br/><br/>What is a chapter? How it is determined in a single session?<br/><br/>Negotiating with a Stick<br/><br/>In most of these one-shots with new players, especially players coming from a more mainstream setting I find it challenging to get people to wrap their heads around allowing themselves to take control of their own characters narrative. I also find that most players - especially in a game involving strangers - are very uncomfortable with the idea of harming another player-character. <br/><br/>This is of course necessary in IaWA, otherwise the game doesn't really work. <br/><br/>In a one-shot I've been working on encouraging any narrative work (hence the examples of me saying "good job" when anyone described anything in anyway) and use the conflict map to get people used to the idea that for this game to work you are going to need to go after each other. <br/><br/>I think ensuring that players also determine a consequence for not pursuing their best interest will also help with this comfort level.<br/><br/>Any other ideas for encouraging players to negotiate with each other with a stick?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler" title="BeagleSmuggler"><img alt="BeagleSmuggler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler">BeagleSmuggler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261071/#Comment_261071" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T19:56:01+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:56PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/noclue">@noclue</a> Hey Sara, you don't have anything to apologize for.

If I get the higher roll, my dice stand and you have to answer. You reroll. Let's say my dice are still better (but I don't double you). I have the advantage. We narrate what that looks like, maybe I've got a firmer grip on the sword.</blockquote>\nMy understanding here is that if I am answering you that it is always the person who answers who makes the proposal and it is up to the person who is being answered (whose dice are standing) to accept or ask for modifications. I also am under the impression that other players can make (and should make) suggestions. <br/><br/>Is this accurate or should it be more of a two way narration?\n<blockquote>I've got the advantage. But that advantage die is fickle. We roll again and I have the higher roll, but when you pick up your dice to answer, you beat me (but don't double me). Now you have the advantage. Again we can negotiate. This time you have the stick. If I don't want to get injured or exhausted, perhaps I better offer you something that you want instead.</blockquote>\nWhy do I have the stick in this part?\n<blockquote>If we can't come to terms, we roll again. However, this time who ever ends up on top wins the conflict. Still, there's no resolution. The dice haven't decided who gets the sword. If you've won, you get to injure or exhaust me, unless I offer up something else you want.<br/><br/>Maybe getting the sword isn't all that important to you anymore. Now I'm all "Take the sword! It's yours!" And you're all "nope, looks like you're exhausted from the struggle.

(Sara, if I wrote the above in a way that was clear enough for you to understand--and it probably wasn't--would you say this is the typical way you play In a Wicked Age..., or something that happened just at that session?)</blockquote>\nI may be able to better respond to this when my questions that I threw at Jason and 'noclue' are answered about who has control of narration when. <br/><br/>I would generally say that this is a combination of two things.<br/><br/>1. My spotty recollection of what Ryan taught us (sorry Ryan!)<br/><br/>2. My prioritization of creating an atmosphere that encouraged a group of mostly strangers to experiment in the area of collective narrative gaming. <br/><br/>On the first, when I ran my first session of IaWA as part of TAG back in September I remembered this much:<br/><br/>1. Players roll dice for conflict resolution.<br/><br/>2. There are never more than three rounds. <br/><br/>3. Someone goes on the owe list if they go up against bigger dice and don't loose. <br/><br/>4. Conflict can stop before the three rounds are finished. <br/><br/>5. There is a narration sequence that involves something about one player answering another players dice and the person answering is supposed to narrate - I couldn't remember what 'answering' meant so I slotted in 'loses' for 'answering' sort of arbitrarily. <br/><br/>Since September I've run the game roughly once a month and had a variety of people who have and have not played it attend. Most of these people added their own recollections to the rules and certain things were cleared up.<br/><br/>1. A player loses a conflict if at anytime they are doubled. <br/><br/>2. There is an 'initiative' round each of the three times the dice are rolled, whoever wins that round (has the higher roll, ties of high rolls being broken by the lower dice) lets their dice stand while the other person answers them.... <br/><br/>This one here cleared up my confusion on who was answering and I started to add a caveat to my "most of the time the loser narrates" comment, that it actually had to do with who was answering the dice. Most players seemed really confused by this, and it was easier to latch onto loser narrates. This also seemed to produce scenarios where people seemed to feel more comfortable since they never felt bad about losing a roll since it meant that they had the reward of narrating the outcome. <br/><br/>So it's a bit of both, I threw it in because I couldn't remember the rule, and when I tried to correct the error it wasn't really popular and didn't fly well so I didn't want to push players in a direction they didn't feel comfortable with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler" title="BeagleSmuggler"><img alt="BeagleSmuggler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeagleSmuggler">BeagleSmuggler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261081/#Comment_261081" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T20:22:31+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  8:22PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/noclue">@noclue</a> I just noticed that there were nine players!?!?!

At first I assumed you were asking about proposals for negotiating outcomes. On rereading you may mean simply narrating results after die rolls. I'll leave the negotiation stuff and put something at the end about narration.<br/><br/>Any of the participants in the conflict can propose an outcome as a negotiation. If you can't negotiate an outcome, then things proceed with dice until someone get's exhausted or injured. The actual wording in the book is: \n<blockquote>Normally when I win a roll but not by<br/>double, and not in the third round, we<br/>keep rolling and I get an advantage die.<br/>We can, if we like, negotiate an end<br/>then instead.</blockquote>\nEven after you've won in the third round, there may something you want more than injuring or exhausting the other PC. So, you can negotiate as a Winner. If you've completely lost, it's usually a good time to start throwing out ideas for an outcome you prefer to losing dice.\n<blockquote><br/>Why do I have the stick in this part?</blockquote> In my example we're rolling the same sized dice and you just picked up the advantage die, meaning I'm likely to get hurt. Of course, it's not as big a stick as you get when you win outright in the third round. You could very well lose even with the advantage die.\n<blockquote>In this last scene is it always the loser who is narrating the offer, or if the person who answered the dice in the last round happens to also win the round do they then have the narration and the stick to injure and/or exhaust?</blockquote>Offers aren't narration. Offers are offers between players. An offer might look like "How about you only injure me in one form rather than two, but you get the sword right now." I don't believe the text is specific about who actually narrates how that looks in the fiction.<br/><br/>Narration:<br/><br/>Okay, so there\u2019s a good example in the book with a fight between Mekha and Amek. The rounds go Mehka has the advantage, Mehka has the advantage, Mehka is doubled and loses completely. Here\u2019s how the narration goes:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 1 (Mehka stands/Amek answers) Mehka has highest die</span><br/>Mekha\u2019s move \u2013 I say what Mekha does.<br/>Amek\u2019s answer \u2013 You say what Amek does to interfere with Mekha, but remain at a disadvantage.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 2 (Mehka stands/Amek answers) Mekha has highest die</span><br/>Mekha\u2019s move \u2013 I say what Mehka does.<br/>Amek answer \u2013 You say what Amek does, showing Mekha retains the advantage.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Round 3 (Amek stands/Mehka answers) Mekha loses</span><br/>Amek\u2019s move \u2013 You say what Amek does.<br/>Mehka\u2019s answer \u2013 I say what Mehka does, admitting Amek\u2019s action more or less in full.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261169/#Comment_261169" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T08:59:11+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  8:59AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 9:00AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sara,<br/><br/>That's a great review of how the game has evolved in your various groups. Thanks for posting that!<br/><br/>It looks to me like you've developed a play-style that's perfectly suited to what you want to do, by adapting to the situation and the desires or needs of the players. The results are fairly different from "typical" IaWA play (whatever that may be!), but are working well. The slight rules changes involved are producing some effects, such as the leaning towards comedy/slapstick, that aren't at all surprising, in hindsight. Instead of "negotiating with the Stick", we have loser narrations that seek to be entertaining and colourful.<br/><br/>That's pretty interesting and pretty cool! No wonder lots of funny stuff happens in play, tending on the side of humour.<br/><br/>As for all the confusion about ordering and picking sides and stuff, it's actually much simpler than you're making it out to be, I think. The IaWA rules are pretty simple:<br/><br/>* When a "Oh, no, you don't!" situation comes up, everyone involved rolls dice. <br/>* Then everyone gets to say something about what their character is doing, in order of die rolls. <br/>* When someone says something that your character opposes, or something that could hurt your character, you reroll your dice and say how it turned out based on that die roll. <br/>* Once you've had to "answer" someone (which means "narrating the outcome of their action against your character"), though, you don't get your own action any more--you've been busy struggling with whoever is doing something to your character.<br/><br/>There's no need to worry about who's potentially going to end up on the Owe List or who is on which side until the dice are rolled and narrations exchanged. It's fun and flexible, because I might start out wanting one thing, but, based on how things have changed since the dice were first rolled, I might decide on a different course of action by the time my turn to narrate an action has come around.<br/><br/>There might be a game that's more well-suited to what you're trying to do than IaWA (perhaps a game that doesn't force players to go at each others' throats in order to be successful, for instance--that's something that can be difficult for strangers to do), but that's a whole other discussion. If you're happy with what the game is doing for you, there's no need to go looking elsewhere!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265778/#Comment_265778" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T10:34:31+00:00" title="April  6, 2010 10:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2010 11:21AM by Daniel H..">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BeagleSmuggler</cite>This is one of the most difficult questions for me as a host. Knowing that we have a fairly diverse group of gamers with different play levels and different expectations I feel like a terrible host if I think that someone is feeling trapped in a room with a bunch of people doing an activity they can't stand. I understand in that situation most people will feel a social pressure to stay and make a good show, but realistically that person should have the comfort level to say "my expectations were different, this isn't for me" and be able to leave and have a great evening without anyone feeling bad about that.<br/><br/>Do you have any ideas how I could make that easier?</blockquote>\nHi Sara,<br/><br/>If you\u2019ll forgive the delayed reply, I\u2019m only now seeing your comments and that this discussion continued to run while I took some time away from the forum.<br/><br/>I believe firmly that roleplaying games, more than their players, create a certain experience at the table.  So when someone advertises a session of D&amp;D 4th Edition, or Mouse Guard, or Call of Cthulhu, or In a Wicked Age, I\u2019ve got an idea of my preferences as far as what each of those games provide.  I would be surprised to show up to a roleplaying session, especially of a game like In a Wicked Age, and find that the players were engaging in something considerably different than what my past understanding of text and play had led me to expect.<br/><br/>Paul and I have similar taste in games\u2014he and I played together regularly before he left NYC\u2014and I empathized with a lot of what he described.  While Paul perhaps was in the minority this time, as the community of Toronto Area Gamers grows, it\u2019s inevitable that people expecting a particular play experience will attend game sessions and become puzzled when they deliver something wildly contrary to their expectations.<br/><br/>My best idea for you is to be up front in the game postings about what your style is when running games.  It\u2019s fine to say that you\u2019re incorporating In a Wicked Age-style character and situation creation, but following that the course of play will be altered from what\u2019s in the text; just make sure people know that going into the game.  It is obvious people are enjoying these sessions, but others might feel afterward like they got the ol\u2019 bait-and-switch, which would be discouraging to potential members of the community.<br/><br/>Also, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that likely there\u2019s a game out there that would fit your style of hosting better than In a Wicked Age.  I\u2019m sure Paul would happily suggest something now that you all have had the chance to game in person.<br/><br/>I hope you find your stay at Story Games to be fruitful.<br/><br/>(P.S. I read your question \u201cDo you have any ideas how I could make that easier?\u201d as \u201cIn the future, how do I prevent new players from encountering a disconnect like Paul experienced?\u201d  I see that also you could be asking \u201cHow do I deal with a player who wants politely to exit a session?\u201d  If I\u2019ve misread you, please say so.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11607/iawa-slapstick-comedy-and-plucky-birds" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11607/iawa-slapstick-comedy-and-plucky-birds" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11607/iawa-slapstick-comedy-and-plucky-birds/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11607%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11607%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
