Then they fought off some giant j\xf6tunn who had decided to throw a huge chuck of mountain -- containing Aire's home, the radio tower -- into the floating city of Valhalla.  Aire and Kara made quick work of the pair of j\xf6tunn carrying the piece of mountain, but their mother threw one of her son's corpses at the city instead, which was shot to bits by the ancient defense systems protecting Valhalla. The giantess then tried to rip the roof off the Valhall itself, the resting place of the valiant dead, but Ace managed to rouse the ghost army which possessed the giantess with a sickness similar to what Ace got from the fire demon soul.<br/><br/>Then, in the players' turn, various members of the squad interrogated / tortured the fire demon secret police captain, had brilliant character scenes with each other, and plotted to excavate the old burial ground on Valhalla.  Oh, and haven't even looked at the secret, seditious book called G\xf6tterd\xe4mmerung Days yet.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240411/#Comment_240411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T08:55:38+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  8:55AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We rocked our session of IAWA last night, although not a lot of dice were thrown and the players (and many NPCs) started allying with each other before we ended it.  <br/><br/>Still, very cool.

A few failed rolls later, Cambridge would be sending supplies to Boston for the cold winter, but Maverick is now betrothed to Laura Little. Dorothy Little tried to convince Ezekial to take her away with them, he refused, and Dorothy left him with "watch out for Laura."<br/><br/>After dinner, Sam and Ezekial tried to interrogate John Brown, the trader who's house Chief Wamsutta had mysteriously died outside of. After a brutal duel of wits where Brown barely even defended himself, he admitted to having bought a trinket from a strange man that was supposed to give him power over Wamsutta. Instead, it appeared to have killed him, bursting into flames as Wamsutta walked away.<br/><br/>Sam jumped on Brown as the 'real' cause of the indian attack, taking him into custody for transport back to Boston. With Brown locked in a shed and under watch by Ezekial and a few other men, Sam sat up all night to try to write his report on Brown. Ezekial made his forte roll and kept Brown guarded, Sam failed his, and was awoken by a voice in his ear, with no one else in the room.<br/><br/>A few great rolls later and Sam had tracked the magical source of the voice to a man standing in the shadows at the edge of town. A great roll let him get the drop on the man, surprising him with a dagger to the throat. With a lot to lose (his head) the man admitted to being Leonard Digges, the man that controlled the evil spirit Nekoti and had killed Wamsutta. Sam pushed him for more information, but Digges had enough. He tried to cast The Fear, which is when things got even cooler.<br/><br/>Sam won the vs. roll to get to act first.<br/><br/>Sam failed his steel test to cut Digges' throat.<br/><br/>Digges failed to cast The Fear. One summoning later, and there's some kind of Bigfoot Native standing behind Sam, headed for the treeline.<br/><br/>Digges fails his Tax test and passes out.<br/><br/>Ezekial walks around the corner to see Sam tying up a seemingly defenseless man.<br/><br/>The rest of the session involved Ezekial taking Digges to his friend Pastor Downs for an exorcism and Sam taking Brown back on the road. The Digges and Downs seemed to know each other, the friendly priest admitted considering killing Digges during the exorcism, but Zeke talked him down. The exorcism succeeded, but Ezekial passed out from exhaustion in the process, where the expelled demon appeared in his dreams to offer him the power to save his people.<br/><br/>Sm's trip back to Boston was relatively uninteresting, except when he used The Fear to keep Brown and the guards in line. It worked, the guards kept Brown captive, but using powers like that are just asking to be convicted of witchcraft...<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Sorry, not sure if that's 'bite-size,' every time I sit down to write about one of these sessions it turns into a novel.

So when the Swarm assault a base, it looks like a hodgepodge of different creatures all fighting together, tentacled monstrosities thundering alongside suspiciously aggressive star-antelope, etc. They're intelligent and can build spaceships and cities (if they get species with thumbs) but they also spread from world to world as spores. You never know if a world is already infected until the squirrels start acting funny.<br><br>An Event gets added really early in the history where the Swarm homeworld becomes uninhabitable -- the ecosystem collapses, so the Swarm are forced to look for new digs, making them a roaming menace. But we don't go into any detail about what actually happened, so a lot later in the game we have a Scene with the Question "hey, why _did_ the ecosystem of the Swarm homeworld collapse?" Because, well, that seems pertinent.<br/><br/>It turns out that the successful Swarm had taken over all the native species of their planet, and when all the organisms in the ecosphere stop acting the way they're supposed to -- when the star-lions stop hunting the star-gazelles and they sit around and plan cities instead -- the natural order is pretty much a thing of the past. The food chain breaks down, and eventually the ecosystem tanks.<br/><br/>The real bummer? It also implies that the same thing will happen to any world the Swarm take over, dooming them to wreck worlds and then look for more, like locusts.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241515/#Comment_241515" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-11T15:50:04+00:00" title="November 11, 2009  3:50PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, that's awesome.

Mostly talk and no dice.  The Crimson Blades leveled up and went shopping and we kicked off the final arc of the heroic tier.<br/><br/>The corrupt and greedy Church of Bahamut (which the PC Avenger is intent on cleaning up) has reneged on the resurrection contracts it holds with the Storm Legion free company (which the PC Warlord is estranged from.)  This is a body-blow to the Legion.  Negotiations have failed, and now the two sides are preparing to THROW DOWN.  <br/><br/>The Church and the Legion are twin nooses around the neck of the old Empire.  Will this war be a new beginning, a delivery from anarchy, banditry, and despair?  Or will it just be more misery layered upon the old?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Prince Ferax, the Dauphin of Dragonkind,  Arch-Benefactor of the Church's Guardian Council, and fierce revival-hater, has dispatched his henchmen to Coydmawr, the treecity of the mushroom folk.  They are hunting the 'astral traveler' -- that reformist Deva Avenger.<br/><br/>In response, the Crimson Blades throw in with a Storm Legion detachment on a secret mission to sack the lair of the Prince.  Unfortunately, Ferax is anticipating trouble, and the PC Ranger and Druid, who are walking point, are unable to bring down the minion picket rider who discovers them.*  The rider escapes and alerts his Prince.<br/> <br/>Ferax, eager for glory, chooses to engage well away from his lair, in open territory where the Blades / Legion force will have no cover from his lightning blasts.  And the Legionnaires, who are already spooked by the loss of their resurrection contracts, are on the edge of panic when he reveals himself...<br/><br/>* When Mike missed his Twin Strikes, I was like PLEASE GOD DON'T LET MIKE ACTION POINT THAT ROLL, because I already had an ambush area map drawn up, and the escaped picket rider gave me cover to use that map.  So I don't have to prepare a big elaborate dragon's lair map this week!

Lady B immediately freed Naomi and told her she could go if she wished, or stay as part of her retinue.  When Carlowe protested, Naomi reminded him that she was on the free world of Haven and she had every right to abolish slavery there. The scene ended with a shocked look on the unshackled Naomi.<br/><br/>We then had a scene between Lady Blackbird and Captain Vance created specifically to give them some screen time together.  As we RPed (Lady B an NPC, Vance a PC), I pinged the players with a few pics of the actress for Lady B (Monica Bellucci) to mercilessly remind them why Vance might be in love with her.<br/><br/>But their private moment was interrupted by PIRATES, as a big gunship appeared out fo the clouds, demanding tribute.  Vance lost his attempt to haggle, and had to allow a small boarding party to come and take some supplied and fuel.  But as they left on their sky-skiff, they were attacked by an unseen person who leapt off the top of The Owl and decimated them.  Vance rushed to the wireless to hear the Red Manta (the bit pirate gunship) calling down the fourteen hells and the anger of the gods on them.<br/><br/>As Vance banked and fired the engines to leave under heavy gunfire, Arkam rigged the wnch to snag the skiff and tow it along.  The crew barely escaped into the clouds as a storm came out of nowhere between The Owl and her pursuers.  The crew had a few moments to breath before Naomi declared that they had to find that deadly stowaway....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242658/#Comment_242658" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T23:28:18+00:00" title="November 18, 2009 11:28PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Houses of the Blooded:<br/><br/>our Falcon swordsman/Baron humiliated his maid in front of his men, and literally cut her with his sword, all instead of admitting that he slept with such unblooded dirt.<br/><br/>the Serpent accepted an offer by his Count to "take care of" the Countess.

Upon signing the new oath, the word "traitor" became burned in his forehead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242661/#Comment_242661" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T00:20:00+00:00" title="November 19, 2009 12:20AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2009 11:33PM by johnzo.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4E again, using the Rally rules from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10895" rel="nofollow">here.</a>  Crimson Blades + 20 5th level mercenary minions of questionable morale vs. Ferax, a level 8 iron dragon who is a big wheel  in the Church of Bahamut.<br/><br/>Ferax gets surprise, rolls high on initiative, cruises over party, dawn sun sparkling on the steel flecks in his iron hide.  He has 15 mercenaries lined up in his dragon breath blast, plus a couple PCs.  Needs 10+ to hit each of them.  [roll roll roll]  <b>Exactly one hit.</b>. <br/><br/>It goes gruesome from there.  The druid lassoes Ferax down to the deck, the fighter immobilizes him, avenger action-point novas him, the mercenaries relentlessly gatling-javelin him.  Worst of all, the warlord actually lands his Lead the Attack daily.  All the while, my dice stay cold as Cocytus.  Very soon, a hogtied Ferax is begging for his life -- begging the very Bahamut Avenger he had sworn to kill as an apostate.  The avenger opts against mercy.  The dragonborn ranger issues the coup de grace, laying the dragon's throat open.  <br/><br/>And <b>then it gets good.</b>  Because the mercenaries are like, finally, they're done talking, let's get our trophies!  But the dragonborn ranger is touchy about dragon remains.  He has sworn that he shall bear any such remains that he should encounter to the holy island of Bahamut.   The mercs, uncaring, move to carve Ferax's little lightning-sparkly horns from his skull.  The dragonborn totally breathes acid in their faces.  Diplomacy rolls fail.  In the resulting melee, a number of mercenaries die.  The rest slink off to find Ferax's lair and empty it of valuables while the PCs cart Ferax's rusting corpse out of owlbear country. <br/><br/>So, even though my big thrilling combat encounter anticlimaxed in an oblivion of bad die rolls -- Ferax batted about .150 with damage-causing attacks -- and even though my carefully wrought rally subsystem wasn't engaged at all, I was thrilled at the session because never before have I provoked a <i>party into killing their own henchmen for the sake of a personal quest of honor.</i><br/><br/>Plus, the mercenaries are sworn to the free company led by the warlord's estranged father, so there's some chewiness there for later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242668/#Comment_242668" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T04:10:33+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  4:10AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moments from a great game of Trollbabe:<br/><br/>Joel's character, Hasrah, bops a small child on the head.

My favorite part was when Lady Blackbird, Vance, and Snargle (the PCs) had made it to the hangar bay and onto the Owl. As they were warming up the engines, Naomi comes around the corner, dragging a wounded Kale with one hand and firing at the squad of marines chasing after them with the other. Snargle and Vance try to lend supporting fire - when they fail their roll, Naomi is hit in the shoulder and forced to drop Kale as she flees to the ship. The Owl lifts off, and Vance makes one last desperate attempt to rescue Kale, leaning from the lowered ramp and trying to grab him as they fly past. Another failure! Vance grips Kale's arm for just a moment before slipping and dropping him to the hangar floor, and the Owl goes soaring out into the Blue. Moments later, Vance has a flashback to the first time he met Kale - as a teenage thief trying to steal parts from the Owl - just before using the ship's turret to gun down an Imperial biplane in close pursuit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242689/#Comment_242689" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T07:38:29+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  7:38AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2009 7:39AM by Brian_Minter.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In last night's 'Spirit of the Century' game ...<br/><br/>Four of the five characters go to a party where nothing much happens, sneak around in the dead of night, fight some ninjas, and make some plans.<br/><br/>James' character, Tom Vinegar, gets upset over his ex-girlfriend (the world's strongest woman) taking up with The Flame, drinks too much, punches the chef, shoots a mirror and passes out, missing all the rest of the action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242797/#Comment_242797" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T16:14:41+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  4:14PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another session of our StarCraft-clone Microscope game:<br/><br/>Little Olivia, future freedom fighter, <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/118/happy-birthday-olivia/" rel="nofollow">betrays her dad</a> to the occupying aliens at her 10th birthday party.
