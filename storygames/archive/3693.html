One thing that's happening is that you're not playing Dogs in the Vineyard anymore. THe game is defined by the town and the player's decision about it. The canteen? That's another game entirely.<br/><br/>Which may or may not be fine, I dunno. You're talking about DOGS, which is a stand-in for any ol' alternative game. Ok. <br/><br/>Here's a question: Why are you trying to attract traditional gamers in the first place? I don't bother, myself.<br/><br/><br/>Secondly, it seems you're approaching from a traditional gamer background. "How can I use this ruleset to do this totally different and cool thing?"<br/><br/>Well, sounds like you're a game designer now, for one. The vast majority of these alternative games discussed here work under a certain context and setup, Dogs In the Vineyard in particular. This is not to say you can't do whatever you want when you play a game. Go nuts. Game Designer X ain't gonna stop you. But, it is to say you aren't confronting the things those games where designed intentionally to confront.<br/><br/>The basic assumption here is: Gamers can't know just from reading in a convention book whether a game is reliably fun. They have to have another parcel of information or experience <i>just to trust that the game is actually fun</i>. That means the default assumption is that games listed in such booklets arern't to be trusted. That is, <i>that they are not fun!</i><br/><br/>This is monumentally fucked up!<br/><br/>Jim, whom are you trying to attract? Why? For what purpose? And, why is that something you wish to continue to do in the face of distaste with the possible audience and failed results?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare" title="devilmaycare"><img alt="devilmaycare" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare">devilmaycare</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82851/#Comment_82851" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T18:31:39+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  6:31PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does the hook have to do with complexity/three act structure?

(And, be warned, doing so sometimes doesn't work well.)<br/><br/>I put forth that the reason you can't do this at a con is that you and your pals quite rightly share a system -- an unspoken means to know what they can and can't do, know how they go about doing it, and can't wait to come back for more precisely because the other people at the table "get this."<br/><br/>Sounds like you have such a system. It's more robust than you might think. It never need be written down, and still it works quite well most of the time. Good! Good for you and the group! I'm saying that sincerely.<br/><br/>Whereas, people at a con have very little notion at all, certainly no unspoken one, how to go about all this fun you're having at home. They have no trust. They have no prior experience. They have no idea that Bob over there really like to push Charlie's buttons via his character in play AND that Charlie actually enjoys this! And so on. So, they have to feel around, cautiously, which means that play is tepid a boring, frequently. <br/><br/>But, if you jump into, say, a three-act structure, well then! Now they have some common language. They ALREADY KNOW that Mr. Johnson is going to betray them after the run, or that So-and-so is really a necromancer who will capture the girl and we'll have to save her in the last act. <br/><br/>The three-act thing is a common denominator. It lets people who embrace that thing (and to be clear, it's 99% of time NOT my thing) just get over the non-surprise about Mr. Johnson and have fun anyway.<br/><br/>Do these seem plausible? I am not certain about them, but my experience is that these kinds of patterns repeat frequently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82858/#Comment_82858" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T18:56:37+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  6:56PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            matt,<br/><br/>yes. but you've pretty much told me what i already suspected.<br/><br/>my fear is that while gaming (indie or otherwise) is about challenges and conflicts, the common denominator of a three act story makes them easier to digest, regardless of the rules system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82860/#Comment_82860" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T19:07:28+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  7:07PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2007 7:13PM by Josh Roby.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>Moving on.

Different for different sake?<br/><br/>4) How far can you move from the THREE ACT structure before you lose your audience? Any audience.</blockquote>\n1) Judson has this right on the money: any film or book or whatever that has a "big twist" also has something that's interesting for the first three-quarters of the story.  In the Sixth Sense, it's "this kid can see dead people!"  Then the <em>twist</em> is, "Oh, and Bruce WIllis is dead, too!"  So if you want the twist to be a reveal, you have to make sure the content prior to the twist is interesting in and of itself first.<br/><br/>2) This is sort of a non-question, or at least one that can't really have an answer.  "Threshold of acceptability?"  Whose threshold?  Who is accepting or not accepting?  And so on.<br/><br/>2a) I seem to recall that you haven't read the <em>Dogs</em> book, Jim.  The game simply doesn't operate outside of towns -- much like the Enterprise doesn't actually do anything between interplanetary crises.  Specifically, the GM doesn't have any dice to roll unless he's using an NPC from a town derived from a hierarchy of sin (or demonic influence dice, also derived from a hierarchy of sin).  You could certainly take the <em>idea from the setting</em> of pseudo-Mormon pseudo-paladins in a pseudo-Wild West and do the desert plot with a different rule set.  Is it still <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em>?  Hard to say... although they aren't in the vineyard if they're out in the middle of the desert.<br/><br/>2b) This, on the other hand, is every single game of <em>Dogs</em> ever played.<br/><br/>Another word about 2) and 2a) -- you seem to be asking, "How much can I change and it still be <em>Dogs</em>?" and there really isn't an answer to that.  It is, in fact, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_and_change" rel="nofollow">Problem of Identity over Time</a>.  It's marginally more useful to talk about whether you would actually be communicating to anybody if you called it <em>Dogs</em>.  Would people show up and be disappointed?  Probably.  Because <em>Dogs</em> is more than guys with six-guns in funny coats.  It's about guys with six-guns in funny coats <em>judging Towns</em>.<br/><br/>3) Speaking as an indie designer, the only value that any game idea can have is whether I want to play it.  Which doesn't seem to be what you're after.  You seem to be after "would people play it" and to that I'll defer to JDCorley.  In the absence of market data, I know I'm highly skeptical of "different for different's sake" and I prefer to hear a rationale backing up the design decision.  Even if the rationale is, "Dude, it's <em>totally wicked fun</em> playing gelatinous cubes trying to clean the dungeon!"<br/><br/>4) By "three act" do you mean Rising Action / Climax / Denouement, or something more specific?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>5) but if i tried to run this at a con, i bet people who balk at it.</blockquote>\n5) Now, just to be clear: are you talking about whether players would not enjoy themselves if they played it, or if they wouldn't sign up for it to start with?

If you don't believe in your stuff, why should I?<br/><br/>The story must still follow the same general principles...That's not necessarily so. It's certainly easier to convey your message and sell your experience if you and the reader are making the same assumptions about the thing your selling. But, it isn't really fair to say "games must be x" then show examples of some games with x that are successful as proof of that statement. The best you can say is that some games that are x have been successful. <br/><br/>Also the thing about con games, especially con games with people I don't know, is that I've got fifty words in which to judge whether or not I want to commit the next four hours of my life (Yes, 4 hours. I have to tell you that the chance of getting 4 strangers to commit to sitting in a game room together at a con for 14 hours is just about nil. The only way to do it is to challenge their manhood or something).\n<blockquote>If I posted this... for instance...<br/><br/><i>Lucifer is dying. The seals of hell are broken. The end is near.</i><br/>I haven't told you what you're playing or what's at stake. Would you still show up?</blockquote>\nQuite possibly. The setting sounds completely, mind blowingly amazing...unfortunately what you have there is a teaser. Its good to grab attention. But its on its own it doesn't sell effectively. Its good sizzle, but there's no close. Still, its damn good sizzle...I might show up and to see what all the hype is about. \n<blockquote>This one?<br/><br/><i>The Fates have left us. The Dwarves of the North lie in their icy tombs. The elves, just a memory. Mankind stands on the brink of disaster and the final pieces of an ancient puzzle are coming to place.

That one too is very good at creating an evocative image, but it goes further. It draws the reader into the scene by asking questions. Classic sales technique, asking questions. This is much better than "you dreary losers have been wandering through the darkness looking for a wizard for 26 long years and you've almost given up when I, the GM, finally grant you the CLUE!!!!! Get ready for 14 hours of me."\n<blockquote><i>Born into slavery, you have known nothing but hardship and misery. Your oppressors maintain a vigilant guard over you and there seems no end in sight to your shackles...<br/></i></blockquote>\nNope. You left me in shackles with opressors standing vigilantly...bad. As in, not good. \n<blockquote><i>Born into slavery, you have known nothing but hardship and misery. Your oppressors maintain a vigilant guard over you and there seems no end in sight to your shackles. Four days ago you board a ship to a new world... four days ago you saw the end of the only life you've ever known, only to be sold to another oppressor.

Has some potential, but might be total cheeselog. Slave being oppressed, then freed by shipwreck. That seems a bit derivative...possibilities undreamt? Slaves dream of freedom all the time. Just say you awake to Freedom. The horror of survival against the unknown? Is it a survivalist game, or a game about how freedom comes with a cost, or is there a monster trying to eat me? I'm confused. \n<blockquote>No where in there, in my opinion, have I invented anything that hasn't been run before at a convention.</blockquote>\nNo you haven't created a new gaming paradigm as far as I can tell.

Also, from this writeup, I guess that the game master is totally into wrestling and I like it when people are into stuff and want to share their enthusiasm.  <br/><br/>I'd seriously give this game a look, maybe go out of my way to spy on the GM at some point before I sign up to see what their style is like.<br/><br/>(My guy would be The Owlbear.

Why not write us up a few pitches that would appeal hugely <i><b>to you</b></i>?  Like, the ones that would have you bouncing on the balls of your feet, ready to sign up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn some technical points:  You write these blurbs a little bit like you're paid by the word.  That's fine for a start, but then you need to ruthlessly edit with a heavy red pen.  Rip out every single word that you can.  Work it like you're an editor who gets paid by the word <i>removed</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo start with, you can remove anything the audience knows you need to tell them.  If you're pitching an RPG you can remove any text like "This text, right here, is a pitch for an RPG."  They pick that up from context.  And If you're offering them a game system they've never heard of before you can remove things like "new and unique."  I mean, really ... they weren't assuming that you wanted them to think it's old and derivative.  They know you're trying to pitch it as new, and so they suspend judgment on whether it's true until they see evidence.  All of that is verbiage that's prime for being excised.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you can cross off the second instance of anything you've already told them.  If you tell them that they can play commissioners, bookers and wrestlers you don't then have to tell them that they can play every aspect of wrestling (though I note that you don't describe rules for playing the scantily clad groupie-girls who hand folding chairs into the ring).  If you tell them that it's two-fisted you probably don't need to tell them that it's over-the-top.  Again, more words you can get rewarded for removing.  You get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you've ripped out all that stuff, what's left will be only the stuff that hits right below the solar plexus.  It will be the raw, gut-level appeal of your game.  Don't <b>tell them</b> it's cool ... <b>show them</b> it's cool.  Use <i>only</i> the words that show them how cool it is.  Less is totally more in this case.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText"><strike>Take charge of your own wrestling federation in jim pinto's</strike> Stranglehold, <strike>a new and unique way of playing</strike> wrestling. <strike>Take on the role of</strike> commissioner, booker, and wrestler in this no-holds barred, <strike>two-fisted, over the top,</strike> steel cage, <strike>action-packed</strike> roleplaying game. <strike>Don't just sit there and watch the action.

And you use this phrase and this summation as if we all know what you're talking about when you use it.<br/><br/>Now, I think about three act structures all the time.  And I could break down for you why both "Pulp Fiction" and "Memento" have three act structures, even though they might appear not to have any structure like that because of how they flip back and forth (and even sideways) through time.  Both films are jarring of convention and expectation.  And yet, they are structured.<br/><br/>So, let's assume for a moment that you need to define your term so I know what you're talking about.<br/><br/>So, tell me, what are you talking about?  Please feel free to use specific examples.<br/><br/>Also, you seem to feel constricted by this three-act structure thing. Could you elaborate on what you want to do that is you want to do that the structure stops you from doing?

And this is where I get a little hair-splitty.<br/><br/>As a game unto itself, if that was a back-cover blurb, I'd want to see some mechanical details.  Nothing too specific, but the very basics (do I as a player have a pool of resources independent of characters, or do characters have all the resources attached to them, and how do I select which characters I want to play?).  Because you are proposing something a little outside of the mainstream, I want some assurances that you can actually pull it off.  The bar is higher, and I want to see something that gives me hope you can make the jump.<br/><br/>As a con game blurb, I'd be really wary of a GM who wanted to cram too much content into one play session.  I'd also be wary of a GM who has no good focus for <em>this game this time</em>.  I get from the blurb, "this is a BIG BIG game with lots of STUFF!" and my immediate reaction is, "does this guy know how much of his fantastic STUFF will fit into a con game session?"

Anyone who can say that <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is "stuff happens", and can't see that both<i> Pulp Fiction</i> and<i> Memento </i>have clear structure hasn't really been paying attention.  Certainly, such a person hasn't been paying attention to these films as a <i>writer</i> of stories.<br/><br/>So, we'll leave that off that table and get back to RPGs.  <br/><br/>Because I really have to ask what games have you played lately?<br/><br/>In the previous thread you asked:<br/><br/><b>"What sorts of games do you find people will play at a CONVENTION or wherever, that do not follow a strict 3-act structure, do not have UBER-THEMES, do not involve a GM just showing up with blank character sheets (albeit this can be a good thing), or in general does not feel like an RPGA xerox event?"</b><br/><br/>I replied:<br/><br/><i>Sorcerer<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Full Light, Full Steam<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/>Universalis<br/>HeroQuest<br/>Burning Wheel<br/>The Riddle of Steel</i><br/><br/>You never addressed this.<br/><br/>As you go on blithely about "gamers" and what games are out there and how they're all like RPGA xerox's I can only suspect that you've never played any of the above games, let alone read them.<br/><br/>And when you ask questions like, "is failure bad? does it affect your fun if you try and fail?" I can, again, only assume you've never played the above games, let alone read then, since failure is clearly a satisfying option for those games, and failure is addressed explicitly in some of them.<br/><br/>Part of my confusion with your posts (and I find most of them confusing) is that you're posting <i>here</i>, on this site, with questions and attitudes that seem about 8 years behind the curve of game design and play.<br/><br/>You made a request in the previous thread. I gave specific answers to your request. <br/><br/>Would you please respond to my reply?  Have you read any of the listed games? Have you played them?  Or are you only drawing from your apparently bitter memories of RPGA events you didn't like very much with no other game experiences, texts or rules to drawn on.<br/><br/>Because you keep asking questions that have been addressed in one way or another in the rules listed above.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83042/#Comment_83042" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T14:41:37+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  2:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2007 2:43PM by Josh Roby.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>i like complications that aren't solved in 10 minutes. i like complications that add on to other complications. i like 15 things to solve at once.</blockquote>\nAhhhhh.

format:<br/><br/>party meets mysterious man in bar and gets handed plot<br/>party investigates plot and learns of complications<br/>party plans for complication and kills dragon<br/><br/>this is extremely over-simplified<br/><br/>but this is the 3-act format (as it is most used).</blockquote>\nSo, but this doesn't just mean "rising action, through complications, to climax and denouement," but "rising action, through complications, to climax and denouement, with a party of characters, an agenda that gets handed to them, and a very tidy ending." That's a whole lot more than just a three-act structure. If you've meant all that when you've been saying "three-act structure," knowing that will go a long way to clearing up this thread.\n<blockquote>my interest is in finding new ways for ME to tell stories... be it a show like deadwood... or a daily online comic told one frame at a time... or a roleplaying game where the players are concepts like blue, tangential velocity, and time (we did this once, actually as an experiment)</blockquote>\nNot one of these concepts seems to me to be incompatible with the blurbs that people have responded well to here. Nor with the ones we haven't. Nor with a structure of rising action, through complications to climax and denouement, <i>nor</i> a party of characters that gets handed an agenda and wraps it all up tidily.\n<blockquote>as for the blurbs, they point to ... a. who you are and b. what you're doing (that's the plot)... unless you merely race to the dragon at the end of the adventure, we can assume there's a complication/act ii in there, forming the meat of the adventure.</blockquote>\nNo; who you are and what you're doing is not the plot, in these cases. It's <i>the play</i> - we're responding to it because it describes <i>a real-world experience we as players would like to have in a game. </i> That could go with any story, any structure. As long as <i>we, the people in the real world, are having fun in the way we expected and wanted to,</i> the story can be literally anything.\n<blockquote>the PCs provide the climax to every adventure you ever run.</blockquote>\nNo, the players provide the play. That <i>may</i> mean they provide the ending... and <i>that</i> only <i>may</i> mean that they provide a <i>climax</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83056/#Comment_83056" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T15:24:02+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  3:24PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Jim,<br/><br/>We'll leave discussion of movies aside.  Anyone who can say that<i>Pulp Fiction</i>is "stuff happens", and can't see that both<i>Pulp Fiction</i>and<i>Memento</i>have clear structure hasn't really been paying attention.  Certainly, such a person hasn't been paying attention to these films as a<i>writer</i>of stories.<br/><br/>So, we'll leave that off that table and get back to RPGs.<br/><br/>Because I really have to ask what games have you played lately?<br/><br/>In the previous thread you asked:<br/><br/><b>"What sorts of games do you find people will play at a CONVENTION or wherever, that do not follow a strict 3-act structure, do not have UBER-THEMES, do not involve a GM just showing up with blank character sheets (albeit this can be a good thing), or in general does not feel like an RPGA xerox event?"</b><br/><br/>I replied:<br/><br/><i>Sorcerer<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Full Light, Full Steam<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/>Universalis<br/>HeroQuest<br/>Burning Wheel<br/>The Riddle of Steel</i><br/><br/>You never addressed this.<br/><br/>As you go on blithely about "gamers" and what games are out there and how they're all like RPGA xerox's I can only suspect that you've never played any of the above games, let alone read them.<br/><br/>And when you ask questions like, "is failure bad? does it affect your fun if you try and fail?" I can, again, only assume you've never played the above games, let alone read then, since failure is clearly a satisfying option for those games, and failure is addressed explicitly in some of them.<br/><br/>Part of my confusion with your posts (and I find most of them confusing) is that you're posting<i>here</i>, on this site, with questions and attitudes that seem about 8 years behind the curve of game design and play.<br/><br/>You made a request in the previous thread. I gave specific answers to your request.<br/><br/>Would you please respond to my reply?  Have you read any of the listed games? Have you played them?  Or are you only drawing from your apparently bitter memories of RPGA events you didn't like very much with no other game experiences, texts or rules to drawn on.<br/><br/>Because you keep asking questions that have been addressed in one way or another in the rules listed above.<br/><br/>CK</blockquote>\npulp fiction doesn't have a plot. it doesn't. it has a thread that ties together events, but there's no "dragon" to overcome. that doesn't make it bad. in fact, for my purposes, that's very good. even if i don't like tarrantino.<br/><br/>momento has a plot, but it doesn't follow the rules. it's extremely progressive and unconventional. i love it. it's amazing. sorry if that wasn't clear.<br/><br/>now. rpgs. (sorry if i missed this before0<br/><br/>i've played dogs, flfs, and read burning wheel<br/><br/>and i've begged to play PTA<br/><br/>i love dogs, absolutely loved it. i shout to everyone how great this game is. then they play it and are forced to agree.<br/>i like the mechanics of FLFS, but not the stricture of the scripts. josh and i have talked about this about 20 times. it's not my cup of tea.<br/>i don't think burning wheel is a convention game.<br/><br/>i was asking YOU (or whomever) if failure was acceptable to them as gamers... general question.<br/><br/>i'm not asking for design advice. just because someone wrote a book about X doesn't mean people like X. i was asking general questions.<br/><br/>but again, i'm getting "a tone" which is why i was reticent to talk minutia when i had general questions of the populace.<br/><br/>which i'm slowly finding harder and harder to express now\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>i like complications that aren't solved in 10 minutes. i like complications that add on to other complications. i like 15 things to solve at once.</blockquote>\nAhhhhh.

Playing games with darker themes is fine.<br/>Yes. Playing games where things don't work out is fine.<br/>Yes. There are games that don't do that very-specific-three-act thing you described.<br/><br/>And people play them and like them. Not everyone. But that'd be crazy talk. But a lot of people. Pretty much everyone on this site. And a huge chunk of the RPGers who show up to Strategicon.<br/><br/>I mean, as far as I can tell, you keep asking in the hopes that someone will say, "NO!" so you can say, "I knew it."<br/><br/>But it's not going to happen.<br/><br/>In general terms, everything you seem to want to do is on the market and there is an audience for it.<br/><br/>Okay. Now what? Because if you just keep saying, "Hey, I'm just asking general questions," and reality has already provided a concrete, resounding response that answers the question, I'm just curious what you're after?<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83070/#Comment_83070" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T16:17:36+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  4:17PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite><br/>i don't think burning wheel is a convention game.<br/></blockquote>\nWow.

What are you looking for? Even you enjoy narratives with three act structures. You want to design something beyond the three act structure? Cool. No one is wedded to the three act structure here from the looks of things. But...and its a big but...few here are motivated by a desire to get away from it either. <br/><br/>So, bring it. But, it better rock and you better be able to communicate how it rocks or folks wont show. That seems fair.<br/><br/>If its more of a theoretical discussion, please propose a story structure to compare to opening, rising conflict, denoument.

Fine. What do all the characters try and do? Well, escape of course. This, though, wasn't on the GM's agenda. Even succeeding at getting out of the wagon, we got dragged back into the thing so we could watch the next scene unfold. Two points here: firstly, character failure is a different thing from player impotence. Characters failing is just grand, providing they could have succeeded. Players being unable to alter the course of events is a different thing. Second point - if your blurb looks like it might be that sort of game, I for one will run a mile. I suspect most people here have had similar sorts of experience. Whatever your qualities running a game, you are contending with this sort of experience - your blurb needs to say what it isn't as well as what it is. For all I know, the guy running this game is a forty-year old adolescent trying to inflict his angst on a bunch of strangers, demonstrate to them how futile life is and get his own back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you indicate that the characters have a way of altering the course of events, that the players are not impotent? Well, tell them that they have a big ray gun - can't be that difficult, hey? Just get some words together and put them in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother observation here - you may be trying to do something quite different with your games. I can't quite see what but I'll trust you. Still, you seem to be using such familiar concepts that it isn't necessarily that convincing. "You're trying to kill the big bad", "Fellowship of the [thing]", "You start the game as slaves". Perhaps those are just examples you plucked out of the air but if they are then that might explain reactions to them. Your whole point may be that you are taking those things (are these tropes?) and subverting them. If so, that too needs to be indicated quite clearly but perhaps more importantly: if what you are doing is taking those old themes and turning them upside down then I'd say that you are pretty much still bound by those old themes and are still working them out in your own head. If all this is postmodern then where is the fun? Where's the kitsch velvet suit? Where's the ironing? Is Legolas gay? Is your dark theme leavened by some humour? Or is it postmodern without the fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83388/#Comment_83388" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T21:01:29+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  9:01PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>LONG POST</b><br/><br/>Sam,<br/><br/>Excellent observations. Thanks.<br/><br/>Let me use three examples of TYPES of games I run (as I try not to use the same methods over and over) and maybe that'll frame the conversation a little differently.<br/><br/>Let's say I'm running Warhammer Fantasy (or something similar). The PCs start as complete neophytes. This is purposeful. WHFRP's entire game world is built on this model. Life is cheap. Social darwinsim. All that. Eventually the PCs start caring about the world around them and grow in power so they can <i>affect</i> the world around them. This isn't for everyone, I recognize.<br/><br/>Now. At the end of any of my game sessions, there should be numerous dangling plot-threads, NPCs that have gotten away, and plenty of questions that the PCs want answered. This is how i run. It's not how everyone runs the game. The campaign ends when I see it's time to end it, and I start building momentum for the finale. The game always end with at least two villains to thwart and not all of them within arm's reach (no time to kill everything). Its very possible the characters can die trying to "win." It is very likely, they will be affected by the story.<br/><br/>Now. Let's say I'm running an Indie RPG. Dogs is a good example. Because I really like it and I have enough command of the rules to tinker.<br/><br/>I love to tinker.<br/><br/>In dogs, the PCs make their characters ahead of time, from home, and we roleplay the first few days of their campaign lives through e-mails and when they finally meet, they have more command of their character's voice. Unless your gaming with actors, most people (I've found) need a few hours to really find their voice. The PCs meet, through the church/mission/temple and are told... spread god's word. They aren't told how. They aren't told where. And they aren't railroaded or shoehorned. Hell, if I do my job right, I've made 10 towns for them to visit and I let them choose one. But I probably wouldn't do that much prep-work.<br/><br/>Seeing what the PCs are doing, I'm likely to throw subplots at them, tailored to their characters. I'm likely to distract their "plans" with minor moral inconveniences  (timmy fell in a well? and he's a sodomite?). I'm likely to expose them to events outside the "walls" of their world. I'm likely to drop them on the edge of a civil war or some large scale event that's about to affect their world in meaningful ways.<br/><br/>And with the right players, I'm likely to do nothing and just sit back and watch them take over.<br/><br/>Because I believe (and this is just my POV) that dogs cannot be campaigned forever, at a certain point I need to start wrapping it up, which means ratcheting the tension and abbreviating the amount of things they can do with their time. This is all administrative folderol. There's no way to write rules for it. You just have to sense what your players can handle and what they need.<br/><br/>Now. Let's say I'm running Vampire (or any city-oriented game). My city games are massive relationship mapping undertakings (not that I ever used this term until I met Josh). It's sort of like playing a tabletop version of Elder Scrolls (or whatever that video game was called). But instead of worrying about hit points and skills, you are concerned about standing and ambition. Other characters in the world are moving just as fast as you are. They are not just sitting in a night club somewhere waiting for the stereotypical meeting with the heroes while strippers giggle behind them in some Michael Bay-esque self-efacing charade. Instead, the NPCs are out collecting friends, buying stolen weapons, importing drugs, stealing candy from babies, and essentially upsetting the balance of the game's ecosystem. If the PCs sit back and do nothing, the world is still going to change. If the PCs get involved, the world is going to change more.<br/><br/>Short of ziplocking me right into a game box, though, I've yet to find a way to do this... but I'm working on it. COIL will be my first attempt at multi-character storytelling and city-wide roleplaying.<br/><br/>With the exception of Dogs, my games do not have a set "plot." I have world laws that I must adhere to (so I can't cheat anyone) and a paper-mache story framework that I can tear apart and mold into something else at a moment's notice, but I rarely have a plot the first night we game. In other words, imagine you wake up one morning and you don't want to go to work... what do you do instead? The game is a blank canvas. Once the PCs begin to poke and probe the game world do I get a sense of what they really want to do and how I want to pace the game.<br/><br/>And even with dogs, I don't force-feed them anything. But I build a settlement for them to explore.<br/><br/>These styles, do not play well in 4 hours. A lot is lost when you only have enough time to reveal characters, unearth the plot, uncover one or two complications, and footrace your way to finale.<br/><br/>That's my impression anyway.<br/><br/>Although, I hear the 8-hour Mountain Witch games at the local con are great, however. Because they have more "stages."<br/><br/>And of course, combine all of this with... I write RPG material (both mainstream and smallpress), fiction, essays, poetry, comic book scripts, movie reviews, and game convention adventures... all to completely different audiences... you can understand why I would ask these questions.<br/><br/>Finally, to address your comments about the Fellowship. This game isn't about winning and beating Nezzeroth. In a lot of ways, they can't fully win. But that's sort hard to explain without saying too much. Essentially, the game is about, what do you do... when you've spent 26 years of your life failing over and over and finally you get a lucky break and then that lucky break starts to smell like all the other lucky breaks... when do you say, enough? when do you say, where has my life gone? when do you say, the world isn't worth saving? why should i do this when no one cares? The world of Raavnia (the one I built that it's set in) doesn't hail adventurers  as savoirs, but instead treats them with scorn, because they always bring more trouble then they are worth. The PCs (despite their valiant quest... and it's quite complex... the character sheet is 4-5 pages) are just another band of opportunists.<br/><br/>In short hand, imagine a fantasy version of Wild Bunch, where no one has ever seen the Mexican army, and William Holden is an indecisive idealist, Ben Johnson is an eastern orthodox priest who has turned his whole life upside down to be part of this fruitless quest, Warren Oates is repressed and outcast dwarf ashamed of his and Ernest Borgnine is Steve Buscemi in Ghost World (providing some of levity to the tone of the game). There's one more character, but I don't have an equivalent for her.<br/><br/>Legolas is a virgin in my game. Does that count for anything?<br/><br/>Now. Taking a step back. The Fellowship of the Lost follows all the criterion of a story-game (in my opinion... last time we played we rolled dice four times in twelve hours), but it has none of the schwa of an indie game (although I could very easily run it with mountain witch). Does that forsake it from being playable con game fair because neither the SG nor non-SG crowd find it in their comfort zones?<br/><br/>Does playing a vampire game where you're not answering to the prince and being handed quests every session detract from the vtm model enough? or too much?<br/><br/>Is fantasy so passe and/or apocryphal that any game with spells is going to be ostracized out of hat?<br/><br/>Is there a theme that would capture your attention in a convention book (or anywhere) to steal 14 hours of your time that isn't World of Warcraft?<br/><br/>If these questions aren't relevant to you, can you see how they might be relevant to someone you know? Does that influence your fun?<br/><br/>(I'm really just typing questions now. I've written a lot here and I hope you feel comfortable addressing more than just these last questions I've raised.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83667/#Comment_83667" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T10:44:06+00:00" title="July 27, 2007 10:44AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2007 10:48AM by misuba.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.

I wish Sam hadn't said that, because it only give you support in your misguided, wallowing, pathetic despair. <br/><br/>In Chicago, there is an event called "The Taste of Chicago." During the summer, for an astounding weekend, restaurants from all over town set up booths serving their food. These are great restaurants. The food is great.<br/><br/>People wander amid hundreds of booths, meeting new people, sample food from all over the city.  No one sits down and eats at only one booth for a three hour meal.  Why would they?  There's so much to try!  So many people to meet!  You're not investing $28 dollars or more in a meal.  You're trying some food for five bucks.  And if you like it, you'll track the restaurant down.  Same with the games we play at cons.<br/><br/>A game convention -- at least judging by many, many of the posts on recent threads about cons -- serves the same purpose for many gamers.  It's a chance to meet new people, try new games.  <br/><br/>Now, why you keep conflating this with desire to try new things with those ignorant World of Warcraft masses only wanting an "orc hatchet job" is crazy.  It's simply crazy.  You're logic is so impaired I'm beginning to suspect depression.  Or a willful intellectual dishonesty that could also be the source of the circular nature of these threads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83798/#Comment_83798" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T12:46:48+00:00" title="July 28, 2007 12:46PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part Two</span><br/><br/>So. Let's try it again. let's answer your questions:<br/><br/><br/><b>Q.</b> <i>The Fellowship of the Lost follows all the criterion of a story-game (in my opinion... last time we played we rolled dice four times in twelve hours), but it has none of the schwa of an indie game (although I could very easily run it with mountain witch). Does that forsake it from being playable con game fair because neither the SG nor non-SG crowd find it in their comfort zones?</i><br/><br/><b>A. </b>No. It does not. Your game is not forsaken as a playable con game because it is outside the comfort zones of the SG and non-SG crowd. Comfort zones? What does that even mean in this case?  That the game is 12 or 14 hours long? That it uses no rules but your interpretation of how things should go?  That is starts with you telling the players how they should feel at that start of the game and, it seems, how they should feel throughout?  Who know?  You toss these words and assumptions around, and I can hardly tell what you're talking about.<br/><br/>I'll tell you this: Your game is not forsaken.  Obviously people have played.  It's allowed at the con.  I'm not sure why you can't read the writing scrawled all over this site, but clearly the 14 hour commitment is a deal-breaker for a lot of the people around here.  This isn't an issue of comfort zone.  It's a matter of time and placing bets on fun. A lot of folks apparently want to move around a lot between games and meet a lot of new people -- which won't happen in your day-long game.  How complicated is that?<br/><br/><br/><b>Q.</b><i>Does playing a vampire game where you're not answering to the prince and being handed quests every session detract from the vtm model enough? or too much?</i><br/><br/><b>A.</b>  I didn't know that <i>was</i> the Vampire model.  I know for a fact tons of people <i>don'</i>t play with this "model."  You are a strange man: You know how you want to play, and <i>assume</i> everyone wants the opposite way.  I don't know why you do this, but you do.<br/><br/>Let me be clear: You are wrong.  I'll be running three games at the Gateway (at least), and I can guarantee in that in NONE of them will a mysterious stranger arrive to give anyone a damned mission.  Whatever this thing in your head is that says, "That's the way players play..." It's wrong.  Some people do, sure. But not all. And at Gateway, I'm guessing not even most.<br/><br/>So the real question is, "What do you want to do?" and then do it.  People will show up or not.  But please stop with these crazy, countered-by-reality assumptions.<br/><br/><br/><b>Q.</b> <i>Is fantasy so passe and/or apocryphal that any game with spells is going to be ostracized out of hat?</i><br/><br/><b>A.</b> No.  I don't know why you think this, but it's simply not true.  <br/><br/>There's a game set in Middle Earth that's going to take place at Gateway using the <i>HereQuest</i> rules that I can't wait to play.  And I'll be using the <i>Sorcery &amp; Sword</i> rules to do a Robert E. Howard Conan style setting.  With Conan style magic and stuff.  It'll be cool, magical, and fantastical.  I'm scheduled to run two blocks of <i>Primetime Adventures</i>.  For all I know they'll both be fantasy settings.<br/><br/>So. No. There's no problem with running Fantasy games at a con.  None.  At.  All. <br/><br/>The fact that some people said your description of your game's world and setting sounded cliched is a whole separate issue. I don't know what your game world is like.  It could be genius.  People were responding to the pitch.  It didn't grab them.  I think making a pitch for an RPG in 400 characters in a post-AD&amp;D convention is really, really difficult.  Maybe even crazy.  How does one convey the rules and setting to a people who have no idea what you're talking about?  It tough.  But that's not a problem with running fantasy.  It's a problem with promotional material.<br/><br/><br/><b>Q. </b> <i>Is there a theme that would capture your attention in a convention book (or anywhere) to steal 14 hours of your time that isn't World of Warcraft?</i><br/><br/><b>A.</b>  I don't know what the dig at <i>World of Warcraft </i>is about, but I'll break this down:<br/><br/>Nobody, and I mean nobody, sits down to their first, fresh experience of WoW and says, "Okay, I'm devoting 14 hours to this."  If anyone plays for 14 hours (and I'm sure they're out there!), it's because <i>after trying the game out for shorter periods of time, they've decided they like and are willing to invest more time into it!</i>  But, they can stop at any time. <i>No one is asking them to stay doing the same thing for longer than it takes to fly across the Atlantic without having any idea what they're in for!</i><br/><br/>It's that simple. You're asking people to commit almost half of their con weekend experience to your game, sight unseen.  Why you don't see your request as problematic strikes me as... strange.<br/><br/>Now, you can twist this around to: "Ohhh. Short attention spans.  Dull-witted morons who need to be spoon fed the adventure. Oh, have to kill orcs and slather in glee..." Or, you can accept the reality of the situation, take a solid, adult look at what you're asking of people and say, "Hey, if I actually designed something that made sense within the format of <i>this</i> convention, what would that be?"<br/><br/>Because that's sometimes your jobs as a creator.  I just sold a show to ABC for the internet, because I pitched him this big, elaborate story.  And he said, "Can you do that, but in small pieces that are self contained... about 5 minutes each?"  And I went away.  And thought about it.  And figure out a great solution to get what I wanted in the format he wanted... and I won.  Like that.<br/><br/>You could do that, too.  Instead of bemoaning what fools and tasteless morons gamers are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83799/#Comment_83799" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T12:47:08+00:00" title="July 28, 2007 12:47PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2007 4:35PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part Three</span><br/><br/><br/>Finally, this:<br/><br/><i>"These styles, do not play well in 4 hours. A lot is lost when you only have enough time to reveal characters, unearth the plot, uncover one or two complications, and footrace your way to finale."</i><br/><br/>Again, I'm running three games at the upcoming Gateway con.  All of them will be about 4 hour to 4 and a  half hour sessions.<br/><br/><i>None</i> of them will follow whatever cliche pattern of lame-ass storytelling you are afraid everyone plays.  <br/><br/>Further:<br/><br/>A lot is not there where you play a four hour session versus a 14 hour session.  (I would hope!)  But that's like saying there's a lot more in a 1400 page novel and a short story.  Which is to say: <i>nothing is "lost."</i>  Because something shorter that is built well is still built well.  And that's that.<br/><br/>I'm gonna play a Dogs game with Joshua.  And I can tell you two things for sure: The focus won't be on "one or two complications to uncover" and there won't be a "footrace to the finale."  In Dogs, the townspeople come right at you with their issues. The complications is: what do we do about it?  And there's often not a footrace. Sometimes the climax is the Dogs standing around arguing about what to do and guns get drawn and they shoot each other down!<br/><br/>So, my I ask, what in God's name you're talking about?<br/><br/>At the upcoming Gateway, I will have no idea how my <i>Primetime Adventure</i> games are going to run, nor my <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> game.  But since they are driven by: <br/><br/>a) all players at the table; <br/>b) with a focus on the character's issues the Players have chosen; <br/>c) using rules that let everyone at the table participate in the building of content and meaning... <br/><br/>there's no fucking way I can count on the structure you are <i>assuming</i> has to be there for a four hour session.<br/><br/>It's that simple.<br/><br/>You keep making statements about Players, Con Games, and what Players want. You are, in fact, wrong.<br/><br/>How you think people play is wrong.<br/><br/>How you think people have to play is wrong.<br/><br/>How you think con games have to work is wrong.<br/><br/>What you have in your head about what people want is wrong.<br/><br/><br/>Now, I'll phrase it again.<br/><br/>Am I a horrible, tasteless person because I find no appeal in the notion of committing 14 hours to an event where my emotional state is dictated to me and I have no recourse to rules to affect or influence the world or narrative? <br/><br/>Um. No.<br/><br/>This has nothing to do with the issues you keep citing.  Not about horrible attention spans. Not about a lack of taste in what is good. Not about people expecting and needing cliched patterns and structure. <br/><br/>I know this for a fact because there's going to be a good two dozen games at Gateway that run counter to all your expectations.<br/><br/>So. You can join reality, or spend 14 hours sitting alone in your big room.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83808/#Comment_83808" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T14:40:35+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  2:40PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part One</span><br/><br/>Actually, I think the hot dog stand analogy is a terrible one.

Folks don't play 14 hour games at cons. Period.<br/><br/>yeah. this has been my experience. and the overwhelming tone of this thread. it's one of the reasons i've been reticent to try this. but then i talk to people about the story (friends and so on) and people say, wow. i'd like to try that. and the you get tricked into offering the game session again. combine this with the fact that my stories lack the proper tone to write great blurbs from and i'm sort of on the defensive on how to retool things. as i said, people did play it once. they had a great time. and i wanted to run it again. which didn't happen.<br/><br/>the idea for the adventure sprung from an 8-10 hour game i played at origins 95... the game idea was solid... looking back... it was really new... but there was one player that ruined the experience for everyone because the GM couldn't rein him in. so. when i'm thinking up new stories and plots, this one always comes back to me. it's not the only story i have in my bag of tricks. but it is the only story we're talking about today, because it came up.<br/><br/>my 12-player cthulhu larp ran really well all three times without a single word written about the plot. so i'm always confused as to why one thing works over another.<br/><br/>i think there's a fascinating dynamic there.<br/><br/>2. There is no evidence of an anti-fantasy bias at the con or in the hobby in general<br/><br/>i don't know what to say to this. i think you're referring to my over-generalization that people are "over" fantasy. am i reading you correctly?<br/><br/>3.

I recognize it's not for everyone and that I'll probably just drop the event.<br/><br/>as an aside, bob johnston runs those 6-7 hour firefly and stargate events in the foyer. but i think he's a better GM that i ever could be. he really gets into those worlds on a level i really respect (even if those worlds aren't for me).\n<blockquote><br/>2.

Do the majority of people think fantasy is passe? I've encountered all level of disdain and love for the genre all over gaming. so even if someone liked the idea of EPIC con games, they may not play it because it's fantasy. it begs the question, would someone play a 12-hour game about zombies? or a 10-hour spycraft game?\n<blockquote><br/>3.
