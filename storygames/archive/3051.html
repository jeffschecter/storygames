It's the Granddaddy of a lot of games, and it has characters that can be expressed in four words and a few dice.  As an example<br/>+-----------------------------------+<br/>Ninja 4d<br/>Accounting 3d<br/>Fast 3d<br/>Dyslexic<br/>+-----------------------------------+<br/><br/>Is the bulk of the mechanical component of an OTE character.  There are some derivative elements (Hit points, and key words in your character description) but mechanically, that's about the size of it.  Fans of Risus will note that this looks kind of familiar, especially as the central trait (Ninja) is very similar to a Cliche in Risus (and in fact the same character in Risus might be "Ninja (4d) Accountant(3d)").  <br/><br/>This particular gimmick - using something central and descriptive to represent a cloud of skills that fall under its auspices - has a lot of advantages.  It's fast and easy, and it allows for a lot of flexibility because it requires that the GM only answer the question "Would this type of character be good a this sort of thing?"  A whole lot of issues of genre, theme and the general shape of the underlying fiction end up getting shorthanded in the simple question of whether or not ninjas can , for example,  forge signatures.<br/><br/>Now, I've used this approach more times than I can count.  It's my go-to mode for pickup games because I simply do not have another method that produces similar return in so speedy a fashion and the secondary benefits (it's so nice for NPCs) .  But I always tinker with it, and my thinking on why is a little but muddy. The easy explanation is that there's not enough crunch, and that I address that with Stupid Dice Tricks (pools, exploding pools, bonus and penalty dice, die size, dice substitution and so on - short form, there are a lot of mechanical hooks if I want them) but that's not really an answer to what gap I'm trying to fill. I could be adding crunch for crunch's sake.<br/><br/>So, I'm considering a very lightweight version of Fate for my next tabletop game. Like, 5 aspects and some tiny number of skills, and I'm looking at this model for handling the skills.  Now, this presumes that aspects are going to take up the bulk of character differentiation, especially since this is going to be a little Game of Thrones influenced, so a whole lot of characters are going to be "Knight: 3d"*  and they need a bit more to separate them.  My current model is pretty much Core descriptor plus a modifier of some sort, so a sheet might be:<br/><br/>+-----------------------------------+<br/>"First to Stand, Last to Fall" (The words of his house)<br/>Warden of Hoss Hold<br/>Stubborn<br/>Religious Scholar<br/>Squired to Ser Devlin Anaman<br/><br/>Knight: 3d<br/>Lance: +1d<br/>+-----------------------------------+<br/><br/>Now, here's the rub - How far short of complete would you find this?  How much more would you be looking for to differentiate the character from the one to your left?<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/><br/>* Yes, I'm thinking d6's rather than fudge based, but that's a whole other discussion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69754/#Comment_69754" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T13:48:33+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  1:48PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, for me, character generation has to include a reason why I care about the character.  Not "why I-the-player care about my character" but why I, an audience member, would be engaged in watching a movie about that character, say.  I find that the shorter and more compact that character sheets get, the less and less I find my engagement there.  So the important thing for me is the grabby hook.  "Ninja 3d" doesn't grab me, but "Ninja 3d, Single Mom 2d" would.  You know what I'm saying?<br/><br/>The other thing that I find really really useful in character generation are explicit links to what's happening in the game and to the other characters.  So in your example above, if Hoss Hold was going to feature prominently in the game and Ser Devlin was another PC, I would feel a lot more connection to the character, because I know that that stuff is important and that stuff will get used (side note: if Ser Devlin is another PC, and I know the player, then I probably already know a great deal of how we'll interact, and that's useful for grounding).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69756/#Comment_69756" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T13:51:47+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  1:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could survive on this.

There's going to be something concrete behind each aspect, so I'm comfortable about the _idea_ of the character being well fleshed out.  The elements you're talking about regarding tying into the game are explicit in their being aspects - if Hoss Hold is one of the characters aspects, then Hoss Hold is important to play, simple as that. The same is true for any other aspect.  <br/><br/>The rub is that I agree with you on what is important, and the reason I'm asking this is that in a pure story sort of sense, the list of aspects would cover all of those things which are truly important to the character, so on some level I am saying "If you have that covered, how much more mechanical weight do you want?"

As such, there's an implicit Noble 2d in the character above. <br/><br/>That said, while that mechanically answers the question of what dice to roll (4d for lancing, 3d for knighting, 2d for noble-ing, 1d for fringey stuff) that doesn't actually give much heart to the prospect of verbs.

I do wonder how the broader Fate Point economy is going to work though... since it seems that without many skills, you will be invoking aspects a great deal more frequently to demonstrate a character's expertise.<br/><br/>Also, combat may be a little wonky since (by default, prior to invoking aspects) pretty much everyone will be rolling the same number of dice. This <i>might</i> equal stalemates *shrug*<br/><br/>This could easily be fixed by just allowing a few more generalized 'skills' (maybe as few as 2-3) to allow that extra bit of differentiation.<br/>Edit: Whoops... based on your other posts you are already doing that anyway!

Perhaps each character gets some automatic aspects for their House, Profession and  Religion seperate from the ones they choose for the making of their character. <br/><br/>Also I would look for something kind of like Dogs fall-out where as a result of conflict in a chapter something fundamental changes about the character.  Maybe at the start of a chapter ( and by chapter, I am thinking an arc of scenes or maybe play sessions) the character picks an aspect that will be the focus of the chapter and that aspect will be modified as a result of the actions in the chapter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69954/#Comment_69954" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T07:07:47+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  7:07AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, tellingly it's clear that the aspects are successfully calling attention to themselves as the place for the mojo, which is good since that's more or less the case.

That was what drove him in play, when he discovered that on Al Amarja he could do things that really made a difference to people's lives.<br/><br/>The traits are only a small part of OtE chargen, the real meat is in those other bits.<br/><br/>Similarly, in Risus you have Hooks.<br/><br/>I think that's the bit yours is still missing, the traits work great, but it would be good too to have two or three questions about the PC that have to be answered on the character sheet.  Stuff like what does the character most value, why are they not living a quiet life at home, what would they most want people not to know about them.<br/><br/>With short form descriptive systems like these, I think that extra element is really useful in bringing characters powerfully to life.  Harvey was a blast to play, from his bewilderment at having his luggage stolen to his despair when he failed to save a new friend from a gang of thugs to his joy at making friends with the spawn of an outer god (it was Al Amarja).  The traits were only part of him, his secret and his important person told you far more about what really made him him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69973/#Comment_69973" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T08:18:09+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  8:18AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing I'd add, is that with OtE once you add in the flaw, secret, motivation and important person you get a far more rounded picture of a human being than most games come close to.
