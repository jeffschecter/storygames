We chose Chris Bennett's LA 1936 playset, which is so, so good. There were five of us and, being a bunch of seasoned players, we banged through a complete game in about two hours.I got to play a racist district attorney who was fucking his own sister, which is a first for me.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/fiasco/rmap_love_child.jpg"/><br/>The greatest gift the playset gave us was "Relationship: Romance: Incestuous family members", which is very noir and set up the primary structure for the game. The DA is obsessed with his sexual relationship with his sister. His sister wants it to end, but she is, in turn, in an abusive relationship with her husband and needs her brother's help to get out of it. Her husband's sister, her sister-in-law, wants to help and suspects the worst. She, in turn, is raising the Great War baby of a formerly dashing Marine Lieutenant, who was so sickened by the war he took holy orders in France and returned a Catholic priest (surprise!). And the DA's broken old bag man, a rumpled police detective six months from retirement, holds a serious grudge with the priest, who was his commanding officer in the trenches. <br/><br/>There was some really beautiful parallelism and reincorporation - all those diseased family ties reflected each other wonderfully, and poor Bonnie Chiswell-Foley was in an impossible and horrific situation that she resolved through a pair of murders. We had the super noir arc of Woliczek murdering Bonnie's battering husband by pushing him in front of a train, only to find out at the Tilt that "you thought it was taken care of but it wasn't" - he came back, and Bonnie put him down for good with object:weapon:Remington 12 gauge shotgun. Prison, for her, was blessed relief. And the way it worked out in the Aftermath, only the DA - easily the worst, most loathsome character - had a happy ending. <br/><br/>One interesting thing was that the guy playing Woliczek, Steve, had to leave early. We'd established that Woliczek had been shot, but not the outcome of the shooting. Once he had to go, we immediately decided that the shooting had been fatal, and handled his last two scenes as vignettes related to his death and reactions to it (two black dice!). This was very smooth, but we were sort of lucky with the timing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kapsberger" title="Kapsberger"><img alt="Kapsberger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l57/Kapsberger/Elektrostasj/avatar_elektromann_mini.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kapsberger">Kapsberger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297580/#Comment_297580" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T06:53:00+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  6:53AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice information structure.
