The female figure is relatively reasonable for a fit, 20 something athlete. The breasts aren't huge. And the skin textures are pretty mottled and dirty, which plays down the sexy and keeps things somewhere almost resembling reasonable. Sure, the Foresworn female armor looks like something out of Xena and is pretty silly bare, considering the climate, but it's an exception compared to a pretty reasonable majority. And the looks on the average townsperson are rather boring and normalish - big-lipped button nosed cuties are unusual and generally make sense with who the character is.<br/><br/>So, of course, about a week after the game came out you start seeing mods that make the skin tones blemish-free, that make every woman in town look like a super model with a personal makeup assistant, that give every woman in the game huge bazongas, that change all the armors and clothings to make that Foresworn fur bikini look downright sensible in the arctic climate.<br/><br/>I mean, not that I have any of those mods installed. That would be insensitive. I just happened to notice them available on the Nexus and Workshop. Of course.<br/><br/>I guess my point is something about how sex sells, though I guess that exact phrase isn't perfectly applicable when these are free community mods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375213/#Comment_375213" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T14:05:14+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  2:05PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Upstart">@Upstart</a>: there's at least one art blog devoted to women in sensible armor, so that's a start anyway.</blockquote>\nBrowsing it, it's great.

After a while I started trying to figure out why this was, and I realized it was because it was impossible to make a character who looked like me. Even when you could make a character with a "slightly yellow-brown" skin tone, it'd be impossible to get the build right, or the hair and eyes, or whatever. So if I couldn't play a half-Filipino guy, I'd just play a white girl. (You might reasonably observe that there is more going on there, but that's another story.) One thing I liked about Mass Effect is that I could finally make a character who looked (more or less) like me.

And still he made them look fierce and inspiring. Good job!<br/><br/>Later I have become concerned that my game is a bit lacking in colors; there are no figures looking asian or african there. The concern is informed by the fact that I live in a land with a growing percentage of the population being of different origins, and I want my game to reflect that; <br/>- pictures of figures in the game-book is placed there to inspire the game-play, and to make all players feel excited when reading it. And I want them to feel excited by the right reasons; to feel welcome into this world of fantasy.<br/><br/>So, to rectify this, I have started to rework the setting of the game, to cater for such an understanding of what a human being may be in the world of Fabula. I find it a welcome chance to brush up the setting, and to make it more interesting. And that is my main point here; reflecting the variety of human figures in the real world, by helping players to portray a variety of characters in the game, really makes a game more interesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375406/#Comment_375406" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T04:34:36+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  4:34AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Like why does nearly every black woman in games and other media need to be dripping with snarky attitude.</blockquote>\nEveryone in popular fiction seems to be dripping with snarky attitude these days.

Not at all. As you see back in my post, I call out Zoe Washburn as specifically the kind of black woman character I absolutely adore. Sure, she's sarcastic with the rest of the crew. But she's not an exaggerated black woman stereotype who's big and loud and "oh no you didin' " about everything. (Which is partly the actor - whenever she gets a line close to that she plays it down and delivers it extremely subtly, which is brilliant.) <br/><br/>But having reflected on my comment (and watched a little TV last night that helped solidify what I was thinking) I think the excessive stereotype characters I was thinking about were mostly in sitcoms, where the majority of characters are exaggerated stereotypes of one sort or another.<br/><br/>So I was vastly overstating when I lamented about every black woman on TV being an exaggerated stereotype. What really happens is that all sitcom characters are exaggerated stereotypes. And the exaggerated stereotypical loud black woman is a characterization that bothers me, both because I find it abrasive and because it doesn't represent the vast majority of black women I know or see, so it stands out in my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375459/#Comment_375459" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T09:28:21+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  9:28AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joss Whedon is still a bad writer. *arms folded defiantly*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375461/#Comment_375461" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T09:47:36+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  9:47AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bad.

All space colonization is done by America and is set up to resemble American culture. If there are any other cultural elements that have not been wiped out by American monoculture, they are back on Earth and unable to leave in any significant way.<br/><br/>At least Whedon's presumed backstory represents China as a significant power that influences culture enough to have linguistic and cultural elements survive.<br/><br/>Yes, that's problematic, because he uses Wild West stylization, and the presence of Chinese influences seems to be as much of a Chinese railroad workers and laundromat inclusion as it is about an actual empowered presence.<br/><br/>But at least non-American cultures aren't completely forgotten, the way they are in Star Trek and most other shows in the genre.<br/><br/>It's far from perfect, but it's a baby step in a better direction. Perhaps one that will lead to more and better representations of a future where some cultural differentiation exists.<br/><br/>But I do think that, given the fact that Chinese snippets were included in the show's language, that Asian actors should have had a more significant presence.

QED.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost BBC SF shows - Red Dwarf, Hyperspace, Dr. Who - certainly pattern their far futures after British culture. There's no small amount of HK or Indian SF cinema that is clearly culturally Chinese/Taiwanese/Hindu.

Any character, any show.  Your favourite Joss Whedon character line.  Got it?  Okay.  Now - can you name any Joss Whedon character for whom that quote would be <i>out</i> of character?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375953/#Comment_375953" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T13:29:41+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  1:29PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2012 3:00AM by Upstart.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't it weird to blame Whedon for America-centrism, as he's just using the standard commercial scifi template?

Like sometimes their fictional cultures seem to have a lot of Western influences, like all the crosses in Evangelion, or the cowboy influences in Cowboy Bebop. And other times they'll reference more Japanese cultural tropes. Even their character designs seem to go back and forth from feeling more European to more Asian.

However, for some reason this one did jump out at me: I was very excited about the new <a href="http://heroica.lego.com/" rel="nofollow">Heroica</a> line of LEGO games (well, new last year), and then when I browsed through the website, for some reason it struck me that all the player hero figures were male. Women and gaming may have been on my mind due to some discussion or similar thing at the time, I forget. Anyhow, it actually annoyed me enough that I took the time to send an email to LEGO explaining how I was disappointed by the lack of inclusiveness and urging them to include some female and gender-neutral hero figures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376390/#Comment_376390" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T09:34:15+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  9:34AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting point about Lego Heroica.<br><br>I mean, for the most part, they know their demographic pretty well. They know that the vast vast majority of Lego fans are preteen males or postteen carryover fans who started as preteen males. <br><br>And I'm not talking about how the vast majority of rpg players were youngish males in the 70s and 80s, a trend which, fortunatly, is changing dramatically.<br><br/>I'm talking about an overwhelming and entrenched vast majority of the "these are boys toys" type. In contrast, I see girls play with Nerf guns, which are also unabashedly marketed to boys, way more often, and I don't just mean in the context of larp games that use them.<br/><br/>The company has tried a few times to market products to girls. They never do well. Mostly they just become flower pieces that older guy builders use in a garden scene. Or repurposed into something else like a gear or something. <br/><br/>But the boardgame trend is a new thing for the Lego folks. And it gives females an interesting way to interact with Legos in a way that isn't just a mom or older sister helping a young boy assemble a kit. My wife and my sister in law have both actively played with Lego board games and enjoyed them (to be fair, the Harry Potter game has Hermione as a character. And I think maybe Luna Lovegood too.) So there is definitely some room to broaden their audience and inclusiveness a bit in that area.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cavscout" title="cavscout"><img alt="cavscout" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cavscout">cavscout</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402690/#Comment_402690" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T10:56:42+00:00" title="January  4, 2013 10:56AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Rob and Phil<br/><br/>Sorry new to the thread. I think Heroica has alot of potential and while I agree with Phil the actual official Herocia sets do not have female characters they do make two attempts at not being racial or gender bias. (1) maybe the weaker of the two arguments is that all the characters are yellow, which I think takes the Doug approach of making race sort of irrelevant. (2) Their latest expansion has a rescue objective, but instead of rescuing the Princess as is the theme for most adventure games of this level, you rescue the king. Furthermore Lego makes two great female character pieces only they are available in Lego Champion board game. A pink princess and a yellow Amazon/female barbarian type piece. With a little imagination and house rules they fit into the game nicely. Also it shows that Lego made the decision to make the rescue objective a male king instead of a female Princess even though they already had a Princess Heroica scale figure in production. <br/><br/>Also I was left with my girlfriend's niece for a whole day. She is a great kid but a little bit of a girly girl... i couldn't fathom what to entertain her with for a whole day, but when I suggested we try Heroica (with some house rules) she was happy to try it and ate it up. We were dungeon crawling all day, and when she went back home she asked her folks to buy her some Heroica. SInce then I have been playing with all the young kids in my family ages 9-17 and with some house rules and a little role playing my friends in their mid and late 20s like it as well. Dont know why but the game resonates with me, reminds me of Heroquest (from my childhood) and encourages kids to get off the video games sit around and actually socailise... I know what a novel concept. Any way I will step off my soap box, but if you guys are on Fbook check out the page I started for this kind of conversation and ideas. <br/><a href="http://www.facebook.com/LegoHeroicaAndStarWarsAdvanced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/LegoHeroicaAndStarWarsAdvanced</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402708/#Comment_402708" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T15:30:43+00:00" title="January  4, 2013  3:30PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2013 3:31PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm working on a personal pet project right now based off of Deadlands: The Wasted West.

And then those slaves willingly fought for the confederates because they wanted to and...yeah that still doesn't make sense to me. <br/><br/>Despite in the real world there being plenty of black people doing all kinds of things across the whole country, the main ones you see in the books are Voodoo priests. Almost always EVIL Voodoo priests at that.<br/><br/>And all the Asians are either members of the triad or martial artists with magic Asian powers and triad martial artists with magic Asian powers.

But my strongest point to him was simple: the setting has dreadlock haired black *elves*, who hunt demons and are attuned to nature in a degree the magic wielding standard elves don't. I still love the setting for the representation of inclusiveness, dwarves are tanned, not white, there are black and tanned elves, the elven society is based around a queen, orc society is based around matriarchs.<br/><br/>Hell, the entire setting has 2 basic human cultures, one based on arabian culture, another on nordic, and the 3rd one is a mix of those.<br/><br/>After college and some genre studies I got sensitive to representations in art due to a friend's work using pictures in rpg books as a demonstration of how they are pictured, then I studied by myself and got on discussion groups around affirmative actions at the local university, things went snowballing.<br/><br/>I not only want a game with good representation, I also avoid stereotyping villains and women, because I don't want to reduce the white male to heroes, I want white males to be the same as white females, and those equal to black females and males too. There are many other cultures and racial groups too, and I want to give them justice as well.<br/><br/>I am supporting Ehdrigohr on kickstarter because it portrays cultures I have little exposure to, and it seems extremely capable and interesting at that too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402715/#Comment_402715" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T18:38:55+00:00" title="January  4, 2013  6:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2013 9:32PM by Rickard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The oversexualization is pretty rampant.</blockquote>\nI remember when I was searching for pictures of female gunslingers as a place holder on the character sheet for <b>This Is Pulp</b>, and I had trouble finding anything that didn't show boobs. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (I'm just so tired of this.)<br/><br/>Out of the twelve playable characters in my game, half of them are female, and I told my illustrator to make almost all characters active (they are doing something) and non-sexual. I randomized the genders of most of them, but let the "dame in distress" character be a man - this is also the only passive and sexualized character. When it comes to being something other than white, it's actually something I thought about. In my standard edition, it will just be white playable characters because I took inspiration from pulp movies, but in the expansion none will be white. But funny thing is, before I realized what I did, one of the black characters were an African tribesman. I changed it into being a guide instead.<br/><br/>But yeah, I'm kind of tired of gender- and skin biased pictures in RPGs (I hate saying "race").

I'm just not racist enough to care about racism, but I do care when artistic expression is imposed for shock or 'lesson' value, like rape scenes and race-baiting.

(Especially from the link in the pelgrane press article) At the very least, we aren't seeing much Frazetta or John Norman's Gor anymore. I know that is maybe a somewhat pessimistic front on the whole. But I have a belief the society will turn it around. Whilst sex does indeed sell, I think that artists, especially in our field, have a bit of an obligation to avoid that tactic. Sadly, it probably needs an active, full-scale consumer move to make them change it.<br/><br/>The problem I found I have personally been drawn into when currently working on my game is an interesting deconstruction, I feel:<br/>In creating a game about Divination and Prophets, the general base setting thrust is one of a roughly Greco-Roman one. Heavy migraines, blurry events, that kind of 'traditional western' schtick.<br/>When I realised where this was going, I thought it would be a neat idea to include maybe some alternate depictions of how other prophetic cultures could be run under the system. Onmyoji, especially, I felt would be a pretty fun twist, especially with their history regarding them as relatively recently being relegated from court status(The major school collapsed when Shinto and Buddhism were seperated, but most of the practises live on in a mixed form with modern Shrine Shinto) and so on. I thought the best way to illustrate these would be by detailing additional cities in the setting, and chose Osaka. It is a place I have visited, know fairly well, and love absolutely.<br/><br/>Now the problem is is that with just Greco-Roman and a little bit of Japanese as a side appendix, it almost begins to look like tokenism, which is really unintended. The reality is I don't feel I know another /city/ well enough to detail an additional culture in the same way. The option I could take, of Druidic practises, is not only messy and poorly recorded, but also makes it instead begin to look like euro-centrism. The option I settled on was a bit of a disclaimer in the book before the Osaka section with a paragraph effectively saying what I have just said above, and encouraging players to do the same very slight hacks to their games if they feel it will more closely represent the culture they want to use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402735/#Comment_402735" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-05T06:31:52+00:00" title="January  5, 2013  6:31AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2013 6:33AM by Rickard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://montecook.livejournal.com/150303.html" rel="nofollow">Monte Cook about race and gender in D&amp;D art</a> four years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402966/#Comment_402966" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T19:25:04+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  7:25PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Whoa, Wheel of Time is hardcore feminist now?</blockquote>\nI should have went further with that considering there are people who interpret the story differently.
