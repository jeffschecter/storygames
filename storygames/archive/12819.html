It is like going back 10 years in the way I play. All of that gamer-baggage came crashing back down as the kryptonite tumbled out of the bags. I just sat there not even knowing how to participate in the game, and what finally came out was fairly passive-aggressive, as I shut down and refused to roll dice.<br/><br/>What I\u2019m wondering is if there is a \u201cright\u201d way of bringing up the issues. So I turn to you random anonymous internet people. I know one can\u2019t force a particular play-style on a group/person (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=9812.0" rel="nofollow">Mike Holmes even said so</a>).<br/><br/>A little bit of background: the group in question is one of two (and a half) groups I\u2019m currently playing in, and this particular group is fairly \u201cmainstream\u201d in its play-style: the GM makes an adventure/plot and the players are expected to participate in a manner conducive to that pre-planned plot. Fair enough! I know what they want, but then I hit a wall.<br/><br/>I was told to roll dice again and again for the same thing. I was told to roll dice to drive down an empty road, to descend and climb stairs, to make a perception check for something that wasn\u2019t there, et cetera.<br/><br/>There was no \u201cSay Yes or Roll the Dice\u201d, no \u201cLet it Ride\u201d, not even any <i>consequence</i> for rolling bad. At best if somebody failed a roll their character looked silly (usually we were told to just rolled again though). Bwah?!<br/><br/>All of this on top of the obvious rail-road to get us \u201cback to the plot\u201d. Which by itself I could handle! But combined with the dice rolling weirdness my brain completely shut down. (It even affected my ability to game with the indie group later that week and they commented on it).<br/><br/>I thought I had left this type of dysfunctional roleplaying, that caused me such baggage, behind a decade ago.<br/><br/>The thing is: I like this group. The people are all fun and interesting individuals. Plus they are a <i>heck</i> of a lot more consistent and dependable than the indie group! But dang. It was bad. Maybe it was a fluke? Maybe the Storyteller was just having a bad day, we all do. I even got the feeling that the Storyteller knew something was wrong subconsciously, but didn\u2019t know how to correct it -- yet I also got the feeling that if I would\u2019ve brought it up I would have been smacked down, or worse, it would have been taken as an insult!<br/><br/>And for complete transparency: I ran <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?9705-Trouble-in-Hochen" rel="nofollow">a Burning Wheel game</a> for them recently -- before \u201cthe incident\u201d as it happens (because the ST was gone, but the group still wanted to game) so I offered.<br/><br/>So, yeah, is there a good way to bring this up without seeming all hoity-toity story gamey?<br/><br/>Or should I <i>get over it</i> and just game with a cool bunch of people that I enjoy hanging out with once a week?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288531/#Comment_288531" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T13:53:00+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  1:53PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure why you are focusing all this anxiety on the dice-rolling.  This just sounds like a shitty game in general.  The only thing I can guess is that he was trying to get you to roll all the time to disguise which rolls were significant, but even that is stretching it.  <br/><br/>This sounds so bad to me that I don't know if it is fixable.  But if you are really committed to staying with them, perhaps a polite and positive email or private discussion with the ST?  Along the lines of "I really like hanging out with you guys and the game is fun, but I'm not sure I'm having fun with the way we play."  It's going to be tricky, which is why I suggest speaking with him directly first.  And try and talk about it in terms of your fun, not in terms of them doing it wrong.  And I would drop all that let it ride say yes jargon.

Then the next game, and the next game. Basically I became the regular GM, and ran games in basically the way I wanted games run for me.  By the time it was the next person's turn, they had internalized about half the stuff I was doing anyway. And when the game was being slow, or they were relying on the old cheap GM tricks ("roll to stay on your horse. okay, now roll again as you get on the road. ok, now roll again as you ride through the bush..."), they would often realize what they were doing wrong quickly when it no longer felt right, and corrected their behavior quickly.  (I say "they", but basically it was 2 other folks who GMed in a 5-6 person group).<br/><br/>I never really needed to complain to the GM (in private, or whatever), or state what I thought was rewarding or was frustrating. I just made sure to use repeatable behaviors that they enjoyed as players, and that they could easily draw upon as GMs.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288544/#Comment_288544" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T14:47:16+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  2:47PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the post is really just a way to get it off my chest/let it go.

I've never heard of a group playing in this way, but when you break it down here, I can get a sense of the various mix of approaches they are using.  It sounds like they have been having fun playing in a way where the GM just sort of leads them through a story.  But most groups that do that that I've ever encountered limit the dice to combat.  So you get a lot of actual meaningful rolls within the combat and then the roleplaying stuff is just done freeform.  It kind of sounds like these guys are trying to incorporating the rolling everywhere.  I'd love to see it in action.<br/><br/>I think Andy's advice is better than mine.  Also, if you have a better idea of what to expect, it will be less difficult to deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288553/#Comment_288553" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T14:56:45+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  2:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been in a game like this before.

The systems they use really don't explain these things in any coherant way after all. I think that the group assumes that "rolling dice is fun, so roll dice, but it can't affect the plot". I've gamed with them long enough to see a couple different styles emerge: mostly it seems to be a nearly diceless affair and then dice are used for "unimportant" rolls (or combat). To the point where I saw a different GM actually freeze when he called for an important dice roll and it was failed. Major "deer in the headlights" moment. It was uncomfortable for me to witness.</blockquote>\nOur oWoD Vampire games back in the '90s were exactly like this. One major exception was a game I STd which was all Camarilla status games and politics, during which I accidentally implemented half a dozen techniques commonly associated with story games today and tossed the idea of "plot" right out the window. It was a great campaign, the players loved it, got super invested, and then we fumbled on right into the Giovanni Chronicles published campaign modules. We had no idea why the earlier homegrown game had been so good and this published one sucked so badly. I don't even think we reflected on the fact that it sucked until it just disintegrated from lack of interest, with the players literally calling in sick to not have to play it. Fact is, GC played out in exactly the same way as our standard, boring game - you get to do the funny voices and do meaningless die checks while the ST tells you the kewl story about badass NPCs who could kill your lousy vamps by breaking wind. Giovanni Chronicles is a historical and canonical campaign setting set during a time of great vampiric upheaval, so you can be damned sure that there's precious little the PCs can do to affect anything or anyone in the main plot.<br/><br/>This is why I'm so keen on Vincent Baker's <a href="http://independentinsurgency.com/index.php?post_id=473352" rel="nofollow">clouds and boxes</a> - it totally brings home why dice rolls ought to affect the fiction, and why the fiction ought to affect the dice rolls, when to roll and for what reason. Can't wait to play Apocalypse World to see how that notion has affected the design. The Storyteller system games do (did?) appear to encourage, perhaps by accident, a different notion where the fiction was the fiction and the play was the play, sort of like DnD 4E (though 4E is far more up front about that). I can see why someone expecting more from the "Storyteller System" would inflate the number of dice rolls, waiting for that botch or critical success that might be sufficient to convince the table that <i>something ought to happen here</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289255/#Comment_289255" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T15:50:26+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  3:50PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>The only thing I can guess is that he was trying to get you to roll all the time to disguise which rolls were significant, but even that is stretching it.</blockquote>\nRobin Laws (I believe it was him anyway), had some great advice for this. He uses a computer program to pre-roll a bunch of random rolls, and he just marks them off one by one as needed. It's an unbiased system, and any time the GM needs a roll that's disguised he doesn't need to ask at all, or roll behind the screen, he can just cross the next result off. I think it's a reasonable solution to suggest in this situation anyway as it actually enhances not knowing when something is actually happening and in general speeds things up. It might be presentable as saying "This would be more imersive for me if I don't actually have to roll dice at all and don't even know they're being rolled." It's a fair enough argument in my mind, and I don't think anyone would really take offense at that kind of minor suggestion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>We roll dice as a ritualized mnemonic to mark the fiction that occurs. The act is a way of saying, "This is happening," or "This has been set in our fictional stone." Anyone who tells you otherwise has a game to sell.</blockquote>\nInteresting idea, I'll have to think about it. I've recently come to the conclusion that dice are just something to do with your hands while playing, but I like your thought too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289309/#Comment_289309" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T06:15:42+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  6:15AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Irminsul, I have experienced dice rolling to the point quite frustration.. in this case it was for tying a knot in a rope. The failed roll produced a loose knot which came undone and the goods would fall back down the hole!!!!<br/>\nThe whole event could have carried on all night, but I managed to roll high, few!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of introducing some posters in our gaming shed to help remind us all not to get caught up in such dice rolling activity.<br/>\nPosters of a humerus and serious nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe its been done? If anyone knows were please tell.<br/>\nAlso is there a glossary of indie terms, tips on improving game play? Like stakes mentioned above.<br/>\nI could look my self but someone might know a good example.<br/>\nCheers                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289709/#Comment_289709" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T22:38:06+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 10:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2010 10:38PM by XanatosChimera.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One could also use the die checks to see how long something took, whether other factors came into play or not.  Even with a linear pass/fail system like the d20 one or GURPS checks you can have 3 regions, below a threshold the task takes longer, the product isn't as good, maybe the guards show up while you're searching the mansion, and you have to adapt.  In the middle region, it takes average time or nothing significant happens, maybe it takes a little longer depending on the result.  And above a given threshold you finish it faster, the product is better etc.  This meshes with the GUMSHOE idea that if you're looking for the secret compartment, you find the secret compartment.  Instead of the other variant which is roll a perception check to see the plot-crucial journal on the desk.  If you don't then it derails the adventure and you're sitting there rolling over and over to get an action to work to move the plot along.  At least the newest edition of D&amp;D made it that it was the journal who had to beat your perception score on a check to go unnoticed otherwise you see it.  The oWoD Storyteller system allows for this, instead of botches and the 1s subtract from the successes and lead to failure rule, 1s can still subtract from successes.  If you have no successes and at least a 1, the action can still succeed but something happens to complicate your life, if you just have a simple failure the action succeeds but it takes longer.  Normal success the action succeeds and is average result.  Critical successes take far less time than base, or are of superlative quality.  People can roll dice, the whiffs are less likely to be immersion breakingly illogical (you failed to see the Necronomicon under the table) and more about how long does it take? How well does it work? What other complications are there?<br>\n<br>\nUsing an oWoD ST roll and TNG example: the crew of the enterprise modifies the deflector dish in Best of Both Worlds to take the Borg down.  The deflector fires as it was intended to but does no damage.  This could be represented by the roll being what oWoD calls a botch.  The characters did it right, the modifications were successful but the complication that came because of the botch was that the Borg had already adapted to it.  This is one way that fail and critical misses can be interpreted without altering the mechanics of a game.  4E has this to a degree with Powers where a miss on the check still has an effect (half-damage on an attack, for example)<br>\n<br>\nThis also ties into what Jason was talking about with Vampire: The Masquerade being a very flexible system.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
