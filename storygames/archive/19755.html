I would like to ask the community to share their insight about things that a new host could possibly not think of until it's too late. I am thinking to play Microscope since it needs minimal prep - has really few rules and it is so open ended that a mixed group is going to enjoy. None of the ppl coming have ever played Story Games, one of them is an RPG vet but he's the only person I've never met (friend's +1). We are having a total of 6ppl - I got fingerfood and drinks covered. Any other tips?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438324/#Comment_438324" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-13T14:57:53+00:00" title="September 13, 2014  2:57PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (In my opinion)<br/><br/>Tell everyone to keep listening, all night. <br/>Sure, the game has rules, but people hanging out together also have rules, so tell everyone to look out for each other and not let the game (or the other people) make the night less than fun.<br/>The only "wrong way" to play a game is for people to step on each others' fun.<br/><br/>I hope you all have a good time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438328/#Comment_438328" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-14T02:19:19+00:00" title="September 14, 2014  2:19AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things you can check in advance:<br/>- that you have the necessary pencils, paper &amp; other stationary at hand;<br/>- that you planned for a long enough time-frame for the game you want to play, <i>plus some more time</i> because you can never know;<br/>- that people understand they need to show up on time as this is comparatively more important than for any regular, casual meet-up;<br/>- since you're both hosting and facilitating (explaining the rules, etc.), try to arrange things around your house so that you don't have to leave the room for a long time, or very often, because of your hosting duties. Don't, for example, have things you need to do in the kitchen before you're able to serve finger food, except if you're playing the game in a living kitchen.<br/><br/>As you meet up, before you go into the "actually playing" part, you might want to propose some kind of policy re: cell phones usage during the game. While my personal preference would be for everybody to just switch those off, for example, this is rarely acceptable for most people: this needs to be brought up and a compromise quickly reached in the most friendly, everybody-stay-within-their-comfort-zone way possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sogart" title="sogart"><img alt="sogart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sogart">sogart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438346/#Comment_438346" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-14T18:50:33+00:00" title="September 14, 2014  6:50PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great guys, thanks for the tips!<br/><br/>The night went very well - I got everything in the living room as Rafu said so minimized trips as much as possible - we almost ran out of paper card to write on but that was fine. We managed to get everyone there less than an hour late so we played a bit less than expected but we managed to get a pretty good story going and I think everyone enjoyed the game.<br/><br/>Thanks to all...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
