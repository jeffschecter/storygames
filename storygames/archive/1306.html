                    A frequent theme in recent discussions about RPGs-as-business has come back to the idea that there's a significant fraction of gamers who buy books just for the joy of reading them.  And there's the push toward the idea of story-games with this rulebooks and boards and pawns.<br/><br/>Now, I'll admit, for a long time I was a member of the buy-to-read crowd.  And I wasn't really being honest with myself; I was in fact only getting a reader's enjoyment out of a lot of the stuff I bought, even though I told myself I might use it...someday, maybe.  Now, trying to read old RPG books is like chewing tinfoil.  I want either a good story, or to be able to run wild in the setting, without this weird outside narrative force.<br/><br/>Game fiction serves purposes though.  It gives us a canon to riff off of, and inspiration for our own plots and characters.  It can serve as the seed of player fiction, and a channel to keep a game going in one direction.<br/><br/>What if a game were presented as a very spare rulebook, that discussed the setting material as lightly as possible, along with really solid game fiction to present the author's view of the world.  I'm mostly shaky on how this doesn't turn into Dragonlance novels.  <br/><br/>Well, I'm back to my opium.                </div>

                            Kwaidan's a great model.  There are other fascinating books in the public domain that are begging to be made into games ... with the complete work attached.  Or vice versa.                        </div>

                            That's something like my plan with <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>.  The book will be about half "game fiction" which outlines the setting through a variety of different perspectives, all of them in-world artifacts: journals, reports, advertisements, newspaper articles, et cetera.<br/><br/>All of that material was written with a very specific intent to convey the mood and feel of the setting, drop very few specific details, and leave vast tracts of the setting undefined so that the players can make up whatever they like.  There are no dates, for instance.  Only three specific asteroids are detailed in the asteroid belt section, and the rest is left open.  The technology is described but not proscribed, so engineer characters can just make shit up as appropriate.<br/><br/>Playtesting looks like it informs play without overburdening it.  We'll see how well it's received when it comes out in November.                        </div>

                            I'm struggling with this for Grey Ranks, which I am reliably told could really use some flavor and context outside of examples of play.  I have lots of interesting real-world quotes and ephemera (actual dispatches from AK units begging for ammunition and so forth) but I could really hammer the salient bits with fiction.  Fiction's so easy to do poorly, though.                        </div>

                            My angle on this is that I'm planning to include a small storygame in the back of my novel <i>City of Masks</i>, which will be in the same setting but a different time period. The novel came first. Everyone who's read it really likes the setting, so I thought, why not give people a chance to play there and make up their own stories in it?                        </div>

                            Tim, <br/><br/>As a data point, my friend Leo picked up Kwaidan at GenCon. So far as I know, he doesn't own the Mountain Witch. He does, however, know that I do own it and want to play it, and he has always had a lot of interest in Japanese games but not always all the backgrounding he wanted with them. <br/><br/>So... he bought it to read, so he could play.

Microfiction works wonders.  A few solid lines, or like 3-5 paragraphs of story here and there.<br/><br/>I got this awesome game recently called QIN: The Warring States. Getting through it now, but man, it's presented in the typical RPG way, and it's kinda driving me nuts:<br/><br/>1) Section One: A piece of setting fiction that's like 4-6 pages long. Anything more than a page and I'm asleep. If it's gonna be that long, break it up throughout the game or something.<br/><br/>2) Section Two: A timeline of history. it reminds me of a timeline of history found in a high school history textbook, with sliiiiiiightly more interesting bits.<br/><br/>3) Section Three: BOOM You're Making Characters.<br/><br/>It's not until the last 20% of the book (the GM section, and "types of campaigns") where you find out what the game is about, how it's meant to be played, etc.<br/><br/>Compare that to the old DREAD: The First Book of Pandemonium, or the All Flesh Must Be Eaten books (the two best game fiction examples I can think of): The fiction is evocative, exciting, and never goes over a page long. Usually the longest is like half a page. It primes you like a pump to dive in and make your own story, without having to read 4 pages to get "what's going on".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

So that I'm clear, Andy: you'd describe the edit made to the fiction in <cite>Unknown Armies</cite> as a mistake?  Originally, this one little story got spread over the book as leavening between chapters.  In 2nd edition, it's all up there at the beginning, in one 6-10 page chunk.<br/><br/>So that I'm clearer, I'm realizing that by saying "game fiction" I implied I meant the chunks of prose that get incorporated one way or another into various games to give an idea about the setting.  It's my opinion that they have the extra baggage of having to serve two masters simultaneously, and ultimately function very poorly as either fiction or setting as a result.<br/><br/>What I'm suggesting, concretely, is something like:<br/><br/>A terse premise and spare setting statement up front.  Rules in a flowing but clear prose, with setting references as constrained as possible.  Then, either the remainder of the text, or a separate companion volume, a setting description, in engaging prose, with the intention that it be read as simple prose.<br/><br/>As a complete counter example, the most useful setting fiction I've ever encountered was in <cite>The Shadow of Yesterday.</cite>  Whenever I need to make a character, or even a whole situation, I give it a read through until something jumps out at me.  Doesn't hurt that as a result the rules are fresh with me.                        </div>

                            I kind of enjoy the Tribe 8 method: scattered flavor text up front, from many different viewpoints, on many different topics. Rules come afterwards.<br/><br/>Nobilis' flavor text in the margins is also nice; it's a bit of a shame that the rules are very scattered around the book, and the whole thing's organization is iffy, but "spot text" can be very useful.                        </div>

<p>I think it's a mistake to think that setting and fiction require different things. This mistake has ruined basically every D&amp;D setting I've laid eyes on. Not sure it's for this thread, though.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>So that I'm clearer, I'm realizing that by saying "game fiction" I implied I meant the chunks of prose that get incorporated one way or another into various games to give an idea about the setting.  It's my opinion that they have the extra baggage of having to serve two masters simultaneously, and ultimately function very poorly as either fiction or setting as a result.</blockquote>
Amusingly, I posted about <a href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/2005-07-13/writing-to-serve-five-masters/" rel="nofollow">Writing to Serve Five Masters</a> a long while ago.  Funny we should use the same terms.<br/><br/>I actually disagree with you, though.  I think fiction and bursts of fiction are <em>the best possible way</em> to convey multiple things at once.  Because, as Andy points out, reading a timeline of fictional events?  Only marginally more interesting than schoolwork.  But embedding events into pieces of fiction that also feature sympathetic characters, interesting bits of setting, action that hopefully inspires play, and letting that grand gestalt give players the context that a dry timeline might have given them -- that's far more interesting and engaging, to my eye.<br/><br/>Additionally, there's the lovely lovely possibility of ambiguity.  All of my fiction pieces are either first-person (journals, letters, etc) or clearly biased expository writing (propoganda, sales pitches, academic bluster).  This allows me to have, say, some jingoistic patriot declare that "Britain is the best hope for continuance of proper civilisation" and the reader will understand that (a) this guy believes this, (b) this opinion is relatively common in the world, (c) there are fictional "facts" which support his opinion -- Britain does do some good -- but (d) as the narrators are all unreliable to some degree, some part of his bluster is totally wrong, and Britain is also doing damage and eroding away at "proper civilisation."  Alternately, I can include a journal entry where a group of sailors explore the abandoned mining tunnels under Victoria Station, go way deeper than they thought the tunnels went, find strange-looking technology, and get scared away by approaching noises.  <em>Something</em> is down there, but as a designer I don't say what it is and allow the players to make it whatever they like, according to their aesthetics.<br/><br/>The thing of it is, almost all writing everywhere serves more than one master at a time; it's the nature of discourse.  That some products haven't done fiction + setting well may reflect more on the quality of writing than the magnitude of the task.                        </div>

                            OK, I am taking a big risk with my next project, The Fifth World. I was inspired by both Kwaidan and Dictionary of Mu (and the story in Shock), and I am presenting the game as a mythography/storybook, with rules in the margins of these tales and legends. I'm not sure if I'm a good enough writer to pull this off, but I've read a lot of folklore and I am going to give it a shot. The stories will always be short, and focused on whatever setting element I want to evoke in relation to the rules being presented.                        </div>

                            I used a bunch of micro-fiction in the Dictionary of Mu.<br/><br/>What I kept in mind, was that I wasn't trying to tell a complete story but trying to give little bursts of inspiration, little hand-holds for people to grip while making characters, backgrounds and campaigns.<br/><br/>It is so important that a game book doesn't become a frustrated novel but exists to make the game better and as long as the fiction is written with that in mind, I think it helps.                        </div>

                            Tangent...<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about the Eberron setting book is that the section on how the D&amp;D classes fit into the setting prefaces each class with about 2-3 paragraphs of fiction that exemplify an archetypical member of the class, but Eberron "fantasy noir" style.<br/><br/>I would happily gnaw off my left arm if other D&amp;D books would do this, instead of padding out class descriptions with six pages of general essays.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>What I kept in mind was that I wasn't trying to tell a complete story</blockquote>
This is an excellent point.  This is why I didn't like Falkenstein's presentation -- the characters in the story were doing <em>far</em> more interesting stuff than I would ever get to do.  I prefer a more 'cubist' sort of approach, presented many snippets, all incomplete, all of ambiguous authority, from as many angles as possible.  The pieces should <em>hint at</em> the kind of story that they might be a part of, but they should not actually go all the way and produce catharsis.  Catharsis is for the game to produce, not the book (in my cosmology).                        </div>

                            Judd, <br/><br/>My fault for being oblique. The ways that Tribe 8 failed are something I've talked about so much that I tend to short hand out of context. <br/><br/>Tribe 8 did three things, all together, that ended up knee-capping large parts of what the game could have been. <br/><br/>1) It had a setting that was presented in a carnivalesque "many non-authoritative voices" manner that gave huge amounts of tone and color, but less in terms of factual information.<br/><br/>2) It then ran on a game engine and assumed playstyle that was pretty relentlessly Sim. <br/><br/>3) It had an ongoing metaplot that was published faster (about twice as fast) as any of the players of the game were actually able to move through the metaplot. <br/><br/>So what you got was a game about color, nebulous choices, and distrust of authority or any one perspective run as a very Sim and details heavy game using a trad style system born (partly) from minatures combat, being run along a company controled conceptual railroad. <br/><br/>Yea. <br/><br/>Whereas if you'd hooked Tribe 8 to something like HeroQuest, made it about communities in conflict, and used the fictional content as a way to spur players into making their own views, visions, and conflicts with and about the world... it coud have rocked. Or, if you'd given it a heavy dose of factuality, added some micro-fiction for color, and run it as a Sim game it could have worked. But the combination of tone, spirit, and ambiguity with the need for hard facts and the ongoing railroad whose turns and twists even the GM can't see coming.... <br/><br/>Led to problems.                        </div>

                            Here's me agreeing with Brand.<br/><br/>Note that the books I listed were all pretty metaplot-light; even Capal, which was a <em>product</em> of the metaplot, didn't really forward it or dictate a direction.  I love the approach for what Brand put as item #1: the carnivalesque non-authoritative text.  Because really, that describes how most players use the damn book anyway, so why not tool it towards how it's actually used?                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Yes indeed. Although, the other problem Tribe 8 got into by the end was that because of the speed and scope of the metaplot, everyone had gotten used to "reading to guess" and the endless speculation about what was going on in the text as factual clues to the metaplots future ended up screwing with that whole aspect of how people had used the game when it first came out. That, among a few other reasons, is why no one would listen to us when we would say, "Look, I play Tribe 8, and my game doesn't work like that because...." By that point they'd turned the non-authoritative authors into authoritative texts. <br/><br/>Just look at the whole Elatha mess. <br/><br/>Or, for those who didn't write the book with me... Josh and I worked very hard on Adrift on the River of Dream to pack it full of good ideas without making it dogmatic or metaplot centric. As part of that I make up this powerful NPC thing that pretty much just acts as a big sign in the story that "things are really wrong." The character was there for GMs to use, or not use, as he lived way the fuck off in a random corner of nowhere. <br/><br/>As soon as the book hit the shelves everyone and their brother was sure that this character was the key to the whole metaplot. That if they could just figure out his thing, everything would make sense. By the time things got re-visited for 2nd Edition, the character had, in fact, become a part of the metaplot. <br/><br/>So something that was there as color, a GM option, and maybe a chance for some thematic statement ended up becoming Mandated Setting Foe <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>. <br/><br/>::shrug::<br/><br/>Makes me wish I had it to do over again.                        </div>

                            This is how central Elatha was to the planning and writing of <em>Adrift</em>: I don't remember him at all.<br/><br/>See, I'm forever glad I was in on Tribe 8 because I think it's one of the games that can really teach designers the most -- both in terms of what it did well, but also in the ways that it totally fell on its face.  The development of the metaplot, for instance: implementing a pre-planned superstructure over a serial creation that will iterate its own details is doomed to failure.  All other serial creations generate their "large-scale structure" by simply elaborating prior content -- <em>exactly</em> as what it sounds like happened with Elatha in 2nd Edition.  But what's exciting to me is that that work can be done at home, at the table, and having watched Tribe 8 trip over this detail, I have a much better understanding of how to implement the plot-building at the table, instead.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I actually disagree with you, though.  I think fiction and bursts of fiction are<em>the best possible way</em>to convey multiple things at once.  Because, as Andy points out, reading a timeline of fictional events?  Only marginally more interesting than schoolwork.</blockquote>
Oh, I totally agree. My formative gaming included a lot of dark future stuff, and if I never have to read another "and in 1998, the world governments collapsed.  In 1999, everything changed..." passage, it will be too soon.  Besides, most of those time lines are pants.  They tend to be written with a weak grasp of politics and history now, so they're completely the suck.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>But embedding events into pieces of fiction that also feature sympathetic characters, interesting bits of setting, action that hopefully inspires play, and letting that grand gestalt give players the context that a dry timeline might have given them -- that's far more interesting and engaging, to my eye.</blockquote>
Eh?  I guess I've read too much pretty prose paragraphs in margins that did nothing whatsoever for me in terms of playing the game.  And while I've read huge chunks of flavor text, I can think of only two examples of prose regarding setting that actually helped me: the intro fiction to <cite>In Nomine</cite> and the setting details for Near in <cite>TSoY.</cite>  Both of which are long chunks of text.<br/><br/>The marginalia in <cite>Nobilis</cite> gives an okay tone, but I don't find it inspirational.  And I think it serves as a good example: I've dealt with enough metaplot to read "it's a mystery" to say "hands off."  Give me concrete facts, and leave it.<br/><br/>And, I'd say that a lot of the time, the untrustworthy narrator is big pain in my ass.  Basically, anything he says is suspect, so it doesn't serve as any kind of canon at all.  Not only does the in-character narration mean that there's a lot more verbiage to say the same thing, it also means I have devote that much extra time to figure out how much of what I'm told is crap and what's real.  Contrast with the <cite>Unknown Armies</cite> fiction that's essentially a conversation between two characters - it's clearer that they each have their own point of view and motives to deceive.  And, frankly, it's more engaging.<br/><br/>Sadly, lists work well to evoke.  The lifepaths in <cite>Burning Wheel,</cite> the monsters and tomes in <cite>Call of Cthulhu,</cite> and every Chrome Book ever published.  Sad, because I'm pretty exhausted with reading lists.                        </div>

                            Judson, <br/><br/>Actually, if you just leave them there the lifepaths in Burning Wheel don't really evoke shit. They only evoke when you start building characters, and thus a world, out of them. Then they evoke plenty. That's because it isn't the list that evokes, its having a list that is used as a game tool to build something interesting. <br/><br/>The reason the Chrome Books evoke is because Cyberpunk, by the era of the Chrome Books, was about having really cool things that let you kick ass. That's what the game was about, and you used those things (mostly) to kill shit. So having a big list of cool ways you can kill shit in a game where you want to be cool and kill shit is, obviously, going to get the juices up. <br/><br/>OTOH, this isn't the same for a timeline. I see a timeline of Fantasy World Number 1739264826442927548265 and my eyes glaze. I don't care if it is solid information, it is solidly boring information that has no direct relevance to game.* I don't care if 4000 years ago the Sperzi invaded Duckli when no one alive remembers either Sperzi or Duckli. Unless there is a way that it ties directly to something cool that is going to happen at the table, I don't give a shit. <br/><br/>But if you give me something nebulous, like a Tribe 8 character's rant on why the high priest must die, and then give me a system that lets me get into that shit -- all I can see is the PC who is the priest's brother having it out with this pyscho. It ties right into play, gives me something more useful than a fact -- it gives me a plot, a situation, or a conflict. <br/><br/>As for Unknown Armies... I like the UA fiction. It was good fiction, fun to read. Quality writing there. And it... gave me nothing at all that I've ever used in a game. I don't think any of my UA players have ever read it, and I already had a UA vision in my head from things like The Black Dahlia, so its ability to set tone is nebulous. I wasn't drawn to the NPCs in the story, and felt that their world was complete into itself (as it's a nice finished story) and so I never actually used them in a game of UA I've run. It's all quality fiction, but I don't know if it is quality game fiction -- as I haven't noticed it adding anything to my game. <br/><br/><br/>*There are exceptions to this, but they're rarer than the bore. Spirit of the Century actually got around this with its "this is what happened, this is how to use it to blow stuff up" mentality.                        </div>

                            Who knew? About the metaplot thing. Everybody was doing it. I always have to think that it's the "GM Impulse" to get a good story out that makes designers want to encode the story into the setting material. Same thing that leads to railroading and such. <br/><br/>Josh, the episode thing...nails it. <br/><br/>OTOH, why did I hate Tribe 8? Well, I know I'm a statistical oddity here, but I actually love reading textbooks if they're helping me do something. When reading the Tribe 8 stuff I kept feeling like, "This isn't my character, why do I care?" That's basically it. Game fiction feels like somebody is playing, playing well, having a good game, and I've not been invited. You're using up the potential interesting info and discovering things about the setting outside of play. <br/><br/>Everybody says it's about inspiration. Well, I play Universalis all the time, with all sorts of people...I've never seen any of them at a lack for inspiration. Even when following the John Wick playtesting rule of putting the game in front of dumb people. Given a good game system, I find that everyone is inspired in play. All you have to do is start playing. The fiction is playing before you play, and I'm not invited. <br/><br/>Least that's how it feels to me. <br/><br/>Microfiction I'll make an exception for, as I think of quotes and such merely as more setting data alone. <br/><br/>Note that when I ran Castle Falkenstein not too long ago (using Hero Quest), I did, in fact, play in Castle Falkenstein with all of the canonical NPCs, except for Tom! The PCs took his place. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Lists are very good at evoking, certainly, because they present as many gaps as they do points of data, engaging the reader to imagine what fills in those gaps.  Also, Judson, lists may work very well for you in this way because you're very good at pattern recognition and have trained your brain to keep on the look out for things that can be pieced together.<br/><br/>While I haven't read <em>Unknown Armies</em>, large portions of FLFS are totally "talking to each other," are written from identifiable points of view, and have their motives to deceive.  For instance, one of the first portions is a recruitment flyer targetting young boys to join the Astrononimcal Navy; one or two pieces later is an excerpt from the Lady's Guide to Military Service, explaining to interested young women the opportunities available to them in the same Navy.  Now, neither one of them actually references the other, but the juxtaposition certainly leads the reader to see the differences of opinion and hypothesize about the motives for writing both pieces.

That's the other thing -- every FLFS segment suggests at least one situation that could be played out in a game at the table.                        </div>

                            Mike, <br/><br/>I can see that, re Tribe 8. <br/><br/>But man, you should have seen me sell people on that game. I'd sit them down, tell them a little story, read them the prophecy of Joshua, and by the time I was done they were clawing at the walls to play. And once we hit play we'd have players who had never played before, who only met each other face to face 5 minutes before, doing crazy shit like I've never heard of outside of a Sorcerer game. I would make grown men cry so hard they couldn't talk, and it was all because we had this crazy high from the material in the book. <br/><br/>If you've the right sort of players, that stuff was like crack. Focused to get to actual play it was golden. Not focused for actual play and it was... crap. <br/><br/>But, I think we're also just at a point of "there are people that are, you know, different.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>When reading the Tribe 8 stuff I kept feeling like, "This isn't my character, why do I care?"</blockquote>
And, it should be pointed out here, that your instincts were spot-on.  The touchstone characters in Tribe 8 -- Deus, Ardatli, Kymber, Hal -- were the original playtesters' PCs.  This dovetails into the "don't tell a complete story" thing that Judd said.  The characters in the fiction were fully realized and part of their own stories, <em>not yours</em>.  Perhaps, just as you shouldn't tell a whole story, you shouldn't portray a whole character, either.<br/><br/>That's where microfiction really shines: the 'characters' there are basically a name, an image, and little else.  But as a reader you can totally latch on and say, "I want to play <em>that</em>" without feeling like you're wimping out and playing a pregen.  There's still space for you to add in what you as a player care about.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Actually, if you just leave them there the lifepaths in Burning Wheel don't really evoke shit.

And I think Josh's commentary on me speaks to this.  I see a list and already I'm putting together the LEGOs, you know?  I see "Matriarch" and it's pre-reqs, and that says something to me about the world as intended.  But it says it in a very giving way, you know?  I don't suspect that anyone is going to contradict whatever I do with it.  Whereas the Ananda stuff in <cite>Nobilis?</cite>  I'll stay well the hell away from that, because I've got this nasty instinct that the rug will get pulled out from under me if I don't.  Which sounds dumb, but half of it is the fallout from metaplot, and half of it is expecting someone else to have filled that blank in differently at the table.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>When reading the Tribe 8 stuff I kept feeling like, "This isn't my character, why do I care?" That's basically it. Game fiction feels like somebody is playing, playing well, having a good game, and I've not been invited. You're using up the potential interesting info and discovering things about the setting outside of play.</blockquote>
That!  Exactly!  There was a game, and I wasn't invited.  And all this hints and mystery about what happened.<br/><br/>What I think actually does make for good fiction, to my mind, are hard, dependable facts.  Don't plaster over the whole potential setting ahead of time, but if you give me a concrete slab foundation, then I can build a world.                        </div>

                            Judson, <br/><br/>Re: Ananda -- oh yea, on that we agree completly. I've never had an experience with NPCs from the Nobilis go as well as stuff we'd made up together at the table. Ditto anything from the microfiction. I'd pretty much put the Nobilis meta-fictions in the same place as the UA fiction -- well written, excellent fictional material. Maybe useful for inspiration indirectly. Not giving me much that I've ever actually used in the game.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Some of them think rap is a valid art form.</blockquote>
Somebody just showed their age. (Is the hundred-year-old tradition of Chinese storytelling that involves chanting along to the claps of a wooden block not a valid art form?  It's totally pre-modern rap.)<br/><br/>Seriously, this conversation about <i>Tribe 8</i> by people who worked on it is amazing.  Recently, I was telling Dev, "Brand does (or has done) all this awesome mainstream roleplaying stuff that he never talks about."  I mean, I picked up <i>Second Sight</i> the other day to flip through and went "Fuck! Written by Brand Robins!"  <br/><br/>Personally, I would LOVE to hear Brand or some of the other people who've done mainstream freelance writing to talk about what that experience was like and what they were trying to do with certain things.  I read Bruce's reports on creating <i>Gamma World</i> religiously, even though I wasn't interested in the game line at all.  Likewise with any information I could get out of the people who created <i>In Nomine</i>.  Game design is game design and a lot of mainstream books are tackling similar challanges to the ones we indie folks face.                        </div>

                            Heh. <br/><br/>For my section of Second Sight my mandate was pretty simple, "Make it about stories of human corruption and degredation and the monstrous and creeping dooms that come thereof, and make it so you can only get at the cool powers after you've done that."<br/><br/>Which is probably why no one on the WW forums talks about my part of Second Sight.                        </div>

                            "And all this hints and mystery about what happened."<br/><br/>Yeah, this is precisely why, "Let me tell you about my character..." is so offputting. It's not because of the nebishness that it implies. Oh, that can be a factor, too. But even if you're the coolest person on earth, and you tell somebody about your character, what you're saying to them is, "My group and I are good at playing; we had a great time; you aren't near as cool, because you weren't there."<br/><br/>Says that even if you don't mean to say it. And who wants to hear that? <br/><br/>Oh, BTW, the prophecy of Joshua is great stuff! How's that not setting info, and not fiction? How's that any different than if I said, "There's this book in the game called the Necronomicon, and it tends to cause people who read it to go mad?" It's just a fact of the setting, and a good one. <br/><br/>What sucks is finding out that the metaplot tells us what the outcome of the prophecy is. I used to think that the problem had to do with the fact that I couldn't use the supplement information if I wanted to play it out myself. But then everyone cries the same thing - quite true - "Then just don't use the supplement!"<br/><br/>But here's the real problem, and it's the same as the problem with the fiction: when I read the supplement, I realize that it's already been played out. Or at least feels that way. How can I get an original take on it, when my play of it will neccessarily be biased by having read the metaplot version? <br/><br/>This is precisely the same problem that Ron cites with Over the Edge. The book even says that the funnest part of OTE was creating the stuff as you go along. And then the book is nothing but a sourcebook listing all of the stuff that got created from playing the game. <br/><br/>It's akin to the "Fruitful Void" concept, when looking at these concepts in general. Quite simply, if it was fun to create in play in playtest, or in developing the game, then don't include it in the book. It seems like the right thing to do...this worked the first time, so we'll include it for all players to encounter. But it misses that part of why it worked the first time wasn't so much the nature of the material, but the fact that it was created in response to the play happening. <br/><br/>Don't fill these voids that are the real fun behind these games. That doesn't mean you have to leave the setting entirely undetailed - maybe the game isn't about coming up with cool setting elements as in OTE. In fact, maybe a certain game will be fine with a metaplot, as long as the play is largely about creating some other element than the plot (see the "Underbelly" concept). The point is to identify all of the areas that are fun to create in play and enable all of them, not to finish them off before play begins. <br/><br/>That goes for "metaplot" problems, "playing before you play," "game fiction" etc, etc, etc. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

A! is the only WW game I own. While reading the setting fiction stuff at the beginning, I was convinced that it was the greatest RPG I'd ever read. Once I got to the mechanics, my lust cooled, but for its initial info-dump, A! did a great job.                        </div>

                            Mike, <br/><br/>What you describe is also why, I have long since decided, that Tribe 8 changed in tone after the first few books -- even when the orriginal guys were still on it. If you look at the first ed MRB and Vimary you actually have a setting you can use. The NPCs are mostly just sidebars, and there is lots of material worthy of good thematic attack. <br/><br/>Then you get into the areas where things are already lined up, the ducks placed in a row, and the story of the game (rather than your story) starts up. <br/><br/>See, the Prophecy of Joshua is awesome for more reasons that just being something cool that exists in the world. It is the "this is who you are and this is what you do" of the game. In Dogs you are a Dog, you Judge Sin. In D&amp;D you are an adventurer, you clear out dungeons. In Tribe 8 you are a reject, you fight the power. After reading the prophecy and some of the other stuff from the main book, people know what the game is and what they are supposed to do. <br/><br/>Then, after they get done reading the metaplot stuff, the canon NPCs, and all the rest they know -exactly- what they are going to do. And not do.<br/><br/>Matt, <br/><br/>Stolze is pretty damn hardcore at that stuff. His prose is probably the best in the business.                        </div>

                            I like fiction in a game to show me how the game works and what the author's view for the setting was. I like solid play examples that are engading and explain the setting. I guess it's not pure fiction, then, but if I wanted pure fiction, I'd reada  novel, not an RPG book. The best example I can think of right now is Don't Rest Your Head, which has great play examples/ficton.                        </div>

                            That is funny, Meguey, I've been reading DRYH all the way through just recently and was thinking very similiar thoughts to you.  The fiction in there is really evocative.  It doesn't take me all the way there, but takes me the first few steps and asks me to make up a character who can go the rest of the distance and see where we end up.                        </div>

                            Judd, Meg, <br/><br/>Funny enough, I like Dont Rest Your Head a lot. But I didn't particularly groove to the fiction or play examples therein. I found (as with UA) that I already had my own vision of the game, and the fiction (while nicely written) didn't add anything or give me any instant goads to play. <br/><br/>Luckily the rest of the game is so damn awesome that I didn't notice.                        </div>

                            I was thinking of <strong>Brand_Robins</strong> commentary (on Tribe 8) from above about how he sold the game to people with whom he wanted to play, and someone else's commentary about how one of the major appeals to <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> was the way the book seemed to talk to people.  Is there something to the idea that a well-written RPG is more a dialogue?  (In writing <em>Illegal Gods</em> I've been using the style that I'm telling a story and the rules and questions I want the RPG to explore is part of the story.)                        </div>

                            Brand, man, I LOVED Tribe 8. <br/><br/>Tribe 8 and Fading Suns were my two favorite games for YEARS. I imagined having to choose between, and instead being ripped in two for my love of them. <br/><br/>I haven't opened a Tribe 8 book or a Fading Suns book in over 3 years. At all. This is sad.<br/><br/>Nine Worlds' <i>setting presentation</i> was inspired by both, probably more than I've consciously considered. It was inspired in both what to do and what not to do.                        </div>

                            Matt, <br/><br/>Fading Suns and Tribe 8 are two very good examples of how to figure out what to do and what not to do. <br/><br/>Though all this talk is now making me want to do something Tribe 8ish, but with a better system.

                            MtFierce, all books are dialogues. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>One of the best things that anybody can learn to do in their writing is to open up spaces for readers to interpret, question, and answer.  In fiction, the pace and flow of the story should leave places where the reader can go, "I wonder what will happen now?" or "I wonder what that means?"  Later, there's a reader payoff when they were either right or you surprise them with something they didn't see coming.<br/><br/>In technical writing, especially with something like game procedures, the reader should be given time and space to put the system together in their head.  It's sort of the equivalent of letting them go, "I wonder if those successes carry over to victory points?" or "Why would I want to accumulate Debt tokens?"  And then, again, there's a payoff when they find out that they were right or when you surprise them with a clever twist.  If you go look through Dogs again, you'll see Vincent doing this over and over and over.<br/><br/>Matt, <em>awesome</em>. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Brand, don't go there.  Don't make me think about how to do T8 right/better/improved. =P                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>In technical writing, especially with something like game procedures, the reader should be given time and space to put the system together in their head.  It's sort of the equivalent of letting them go, "I wonder if those successes carry over to victory points?" or "Why would I want to accumulate Debt tokens?"  And then, again, there's a payoff when they find out that they were right or when you surprise them with a clever twist.  </blockquote>
Man, the number of times I've read a set of rules as asked myself "Why would I want Funky Points?"  or "Does it ever make sense to choose Door Number Two?" and been completely stumped by the rules.  And even moreso: built up a stack of questions while trying to figure out what a Funky Point was for, that I wound up losing a few of them by the time I'd answered my question.  There should be a name for that feeling, because not encountering it is a big plus for me in reading a game.
<blockquote>If you go look through Dogs again, you'll see Vincent doing this over and over and over.</blockquote>
Of course, I don't think I'm alone in thinking that Escalation goes up, since it's so strongly implied, and Vincent never contradicts that in the rules text.  Oh, and the helping die thing.  Was reading an essay by John Kim the other day.  My next town is going to eat dogs.  And spit out the bones.                        </div>

Incoherence. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>And <em>Dogs</em> ain't perfect, don't get me wrong.  But once you're presented with the basic function of the Dogs, you wonder if that's really a good idea, and the text doesn't take long to give you a heavily qualified answer, which prompts other related questions, which are addressed a little later, prompting more questions... et cetera.                        </div>

                            Actually playing it.<br/><br/>No, seriously. This is not me being flippant. What I'm saying is that I'd <i>let go</i> of my publisher's authority and turn it over to user-generated content. So much of that metaplot was game fiction, some good, some bad. Far too little of it was discernable as content derived from actual play.<br/><br/>I'd put out maybe some of those key books -- maybe a line of 3-4 products, rich with loaded situations, color and means to empower players via their characters. Then, let 'em loose.<br/><br/>I'd create some medium (media?) by which players could contribute to other players' and <i>new customers'</i> understanding of the setting as it appeared in actual play. "We did this, read about it," Or "We did that, listen to my podcast recording." Etc. <br/><br/>It'd have minimal comparative costs, and actually be playable.                        </div>

<strong>Joshua BishopRoby</strong>, I was thinking also more specifically, "Should I write this like I would describe this to my friends?"  I was examining some of the RPGs on the shelf and realizing that they're not all written for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>.  I'm not the audience they expected to play this game, and one of the reasons it's on the shelf (and not on the floor next to the bed, or in the kitchen, or even on the dining room table) is because it <em>failed</em>.  <strong>I don't want to fail.</strong><br/><br/>On the other hand, the <em>handwave-handwave</em> effect I can use on my friends, "You look up Aphrodite's phone number in your little black book of gods of love," isn't necessarily something I'd want to use to run (or design) an RPG.   I ask too many <b>how-why-what if</b> questions to be comfortable enough for my buy-in as a GM in that case.  (OK, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HoL</span> is an exception, but that just Proves The Rule.)<br/><br/>Now, I'll use game fiction (to hook into the topic) to give examples and some background, as well as create that kind of dialogue, but does it ever have to stop being game fiction to become mechanics?  Admittedly, I'm reading "fiction" as dialogue in some cases, but does "Grab some dice," always sound more inviting than, "In order to make a success, you must roll..."  I think it does.  I just think I considered that dialogue was probably fairly independent of "design."                        </div>

                            Meera, that's a writing-for-your-audience question, and in the end, it all comes down to you, who you decide your audience is, and how you think they'd like to be addressed.<br/><br/>I'd caution, however, against simply equating dialogue between friends and written communication between strangers.  They are very different animals, follow different rules, utilize different tools, and have different constraints to them.  There's a big difference between transcribing how you'd talk with your friends and writing in a friendly fashion.<br/><br/>But you certainly should figure out how you want to address your audience (which requires you figuring out who you want your audience to be), and you have many, many options there.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>That is funny, Meguey, I've been reading DRYH all the way through just recently and was thinking very similiar thoughts to you.  The fiction in there is really evocative.  It doesn't take me all the way there, but takes me the first few steps and asks me to make up a character who can go the rest of the distance and see where we end up.</blockquote>
Totally intentional.  The setting, in the end, is just my extended example of how to implement your own setting using the rules as presented...  I don't expect it to be the best setting to play the game, it's just the one that I was able to come up with, given my strong Doom Patrol vibe.<br/><br/>What I do expect to be the best setting for the game is <i>the one you make with it</i>.<br/><br/>Lots of fun DRYH love in this thread.  Thanks, guys!                        </div>
