Encouraged by the (to me) brave new world of "stunt dice," I tended to declare as 'having happened' anything a player asked for that I thought was really cool.  Which might not have been a problem, except this one player had my tastes and sensibilities completely pegged, and used this ability to get almost anything he wanted, which made the other players frustrated and unhappy, which I was blind to.<br/><br/>Actually, that was the least of the problems with that game. Memories!<br/><br/>Anyway, inasmuch as entertainment at the table should be an all-way street, the mechanical carrots and sticks should motivate all the players to entertain all the players.  Awesome dice don't do that, in my experience, which admittedly is based on my own inability to be sensitive to the needs of my friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75697/#Comment_75697" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T12:53:50+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 12:53PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>You're barking up the wrong tree, Walsmley.

I like the idea that at any time if you are amused by a comrade you can reward them. This is an incentive to make the game fun for your fellow players (and not just play monkey to the GM). Conversely though, because of the way that the fanmail economy works, there's no incentive to be fun until the fanmail gets in circulation.<br/><br/>I've <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ripped off</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">borrowed</span> been inspired by the idea of fanmail for reward dice in Six Bullets. No one seems to use them.

Is it just the arbitrary element of them?

Now, this is not in the rules at all, and I will grant you that, but it doesn't mean the play is unsupported.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>But any system where "I punch him!" and "I punch him while standing on a barrel!" are mechanically different at the GM's whim is not for me.</blockquote>\nI can see your point, but GMed gaming is rife with this sort of thing -- look at how games like, say, GURPS (since I know we both have that in common) suggest rewarding characters post-play.  There's this whole "If a character did something cool, give him more stuff" vibe that is just as GM-whimsy as bonus dice.<br/><br/>I will also grant you that this is another place where playing a game with one GM and playing it with another could be *really* problematic, since what GM A's idea of what's col and bonus dice-worthy &amp; what GM B's is could be different.  And that could result in crappy play, yeah.<br/><br/>I just realized that I 50% agree with you.

When I'm awarding Awesome Dice, I'm turning the adversity notch down.  As the GM, I'm the only guy touching that notch, so when I turn it down, what the hell am I doing?<br/><br/>I will say that I still get some fun play out of awesome dice, but damn, you guys have some solid points.<br/><br/>I'd even see it (now, anyway -- curse you for enlightening me!) as a continuum in those games, at least as I seem to run them:<br/>Awesomeness |----------------------------------------------| Adversity<br/>Where the game falls on that scale at any moment is determined my the GM at a whim, sure, I get that.  But now I'm thinking that that's the set-up those games do (again, for me), and that's kinda crappy!  Those two elements shouldn't be two opposing poles, but they at least drift towards that with Awesome Dice.<br/><br/>So, the question I would as is: can you have a GM-ed game, so we aren't changing the subject too much, that has an Awesome Dice component which does not result in the above situation?  I have yet to play PTA, but that's also very much a different sort of game (at least in reading and hearing folks talk about it) than most games with this sort of mechanic.  Furthermore, can you tweak games that have this element in them to prevent an Awesomeness-Adversity dichotomy?  Am I just on crack with this idea?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>It sounds to me like this is all about avoiding GM fiat and the abuse that can invite.</blockquote>\nI have a bit of a problem getting behind that as a sole reason to nay-say Awesome Dice, but that gets into a different subject about playing with people who aren't going to abuse your social contract and the tyranny of the players, so I'll leave it at that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75740/#Comment_75740" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T14:47:21+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  2:47PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ryan, <br/><br/>I suppose you could separate the authority out, so Steve hammers you with adversity and Ray-Ray hands out bonus dice.

That's its own mess.  <br/><br/>You could have an audience that does the rewarding, or provides the adversity, or whatever.

There's nothing wrong with a system that allows A to reward B, whatever A and B's authority is, per se.  The problem, for me, arises when that reward attenuates adversity (when everything is concentrated in the hands of an organ grinder for whom you are an awesome-monkey).  Related to this is the weird and odious "describe your action until you have as many dice as possible, then stop" thing.

Remi's got my BW books, but I think it follows the "you do something and the GM recognizes you for it and rewards you with awesome sauce in one of three flavors, depending."  I'm personally not feeling that.  <br/><br/>And you know I'm a big Shadow of Yesterday Fanboy.  Keys are a reward system that players self-monitor.  The GM gets to try as hard as possible to kick their asses, because that's pretty much his job.  He also knows what they think is fun, because ... Keys.  So in that way there's a sort of cycle, provided (as always) that nobody is being a dick.  <br/><br/>Here's how I do it, which might indicate my particular mania:<br/><br/>In Grey Ranks, there is no GM and no real reward system.  If you think another player is doing something cool, you can have your character make a personal sacrifice - that has painful consequences, either mechanically or thematically, or both - to throw them some bonus love.  That's it, that's all the mojo you've got.  Doing this in play is a huge deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75746/#Comment_75746" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T15:05:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  3:05PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, in your design process for Grey Ranks, did you consider any other potential "costs" for granting rewards to other players besides personal sacrifices?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75752/#Comment_75752" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T15:43:16+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  3:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, is there a difference between awesome dice and arbitrary GM-awarded situational modifiers, such as gaining +2 on a reflex save for some player-suggested reason?<br/><br/>Is there a difference between awesome dice and a GM deciding whether you have enough cover to gain a bonus against being hit?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75753/#Comment_75753" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T15:46:53+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  3:46PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my current design, I have "applause points" which players can give each other for, you know, applaudable stuff.

I just don't want the GM adjudicating matters of <i>style</i>.  If a fellow player gets a +3 save because he happens to be a better talker than I am, maybe that's not OK.  I tend to think that sort of thing is pretty easy to fall into when you've got one guy with a ton of authority.  But none of these examples rubs me as raw as the bonus die, which is what Graham was asking about initially:  "Say something I like and I'll give you a d10".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75880/#Comment_75880" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T09:46:23+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  9:46AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, thanks!

I'm unfamiliar with the system.)</blockquote>\nTo focus obsessively on a single question: I think <i>WUSHU</i> gets around the problem, at least in part by having a very specific and easy-to-satisfy definition of what gets dice: Each detail of your narration = 1 die.  I suppose that technically, this rewards complexity rather than awesomeness, but the two are often close in actiony-scenes, and at least the GM isn't given enough discretion-rope to hang the group by.  Also, players are encouraged to suggest coolness to eachother, and to set eachother up for coolness.  Also, they can veto narration.  Thus, all in all, the players have much more control over narration and reward than the gm.<br/><br/>The other factor might be that, without initiative or limits on how much your character can "do" in a turn, there's nothing stopping you from narrating more as the turn progresses.  <br/><br/>A: "I hit him with my chair!"<br/>B: "Is that it?"<br/>A: "Uhh, and he's knocked out, and I swing from the chandelier back down into the brawl!"<br/>C:"I see someone swinging on the chandelier, so the evening's entertainment has started!  I bang on the bar and ask loudly who a dwarf has to kill to get a drink around here."<br/>A: "Oh!  Oh!  I land funny, from the chandelier, and hit a loose board, and it launches a bronze spittoon in the air to land on the dwarf, Back to the Future 3 style!"<br/>All: "Whee!"<br/><br/>In practice, this can avoid the harsh judgment of lameness, since if other players find your narration lacking, they can tell you so in the supportive form of "Yes, and..."  And you can do that to yourself as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75925/#Comment_75925" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T12:09:10+00:00" title="June 15, 2007 12:09PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2007 12:13PM by Lord_Minx.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>(Doesn't Wushu do something?

All too often you have folks at the table trying to avoid losing, avoid weakness, overcome all obstacles and be completely uber. I like it when the mechanics make weakness uber and turn screwing yourself into the path to glory.<br><br>But I do have some gripes about awesome dice as reward for roleplay (I'm confining my rant to GM rewards because its all I've had experience with yet)<br><br>First, I think the concept is flawed. It presumes that rewarding a behavior (roleplay) with mechanical benefit will make it happen more often and better. But my experience is that folks generally either really like or are uncomfortable with roleplaying. You don't need to reward the first group and you're not likely to turn the second group into master roleplayers any faster if you throw them dice. They may try to perform for scooby snacks, but its unlikely to be inspired. This leads me to my second point:<br><br>As others have pointed out its too easy for awesome dice to reward over the top play and ignore subtle, nuanced play. Nothing wrong with over-the-top in the right game, but nothing wrong with subtle either. Its just easier to add farce to roleplay when you're trying to cool it up for the GM than to develop character.<br/><br/>Point number three, consistency. At the begining of the session, things are starting out slowly and its easy for the GM to spot some awesomeness and toss out some dice. But, in the middle of the session, when things are rockin, it seems like there's the potential for the GM to get busy, I don't know, playing. Now they've got to remember step out of playing mode and into reward and punishment mode and figure out who gets some GM love. The GM should be free to get swept up in all the awesome and not have to remain detached and objective, weighing everyone's performance.<br/><br/>That's actually point number four, its unfair to the GM to turn them into Simon.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76062/#Comment_76062" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T02:24:19+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  2:24AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I'll chime in again, remember a time when I was a player in a game with awesome dice.  I remember trying hard to get some awesome dice in order to succeed at a roll.  I was a super whose power was matter transmutation.  I wanted to turn the alien mothership into a huge bomb.  So, I shouted "Taste Earth science, alien scum!" and hammed it up trying for those awesome dice, to no avail.  This GM had been pretty stingy (in my mind as well as the minds of the other players, as we later discussed) about them, so when all my efforts failed to achieve what I wanted, my play sucked.<br/><br/>But why did it suck?  I mean, I could have had fun shouting the same thing, hamming it up, and blowing up alien ass.  However, when awesome dice are theoretically on the game and denied, that's like denying me as a player, saying that I wasn't good enough.  In that GM's defense (but not in defense of the idea), he said he was too busy trying to keep track of stuff to deal with awesome dice, but it didn't remove the feeling that maybe that GM wasn't for me.  Having said that, if the game we chose to use didn't have the awesome dice element, there wasn't anything else in play that made me feel like this GM and I didn't fit.  That sense of denying me as a player, even though not intended, was still enough to leave me walking away with disappointment.<br/><br/>I still want to cling to the games I like that use awesome dice, though.

I recently played a Star Wars SOTC game and we were in the thick of things. I found myself switching into old D&amp;D habits, looking for ways to prevail. When all of the sudden the GM whips out a compell on another player's "Hatred of the Dark Side (I think)." I'm like "Uh oh, that's really gonna screw us." Then it was like a slap in the face, "Awesome! That's really gonna screw us! Go for it!"<br/><br/>It was interesting watching the player war with herself. I do not believe she had played SOTC before and I'm not sure how much gaming she had done in general. You could see her initial reaction was to resist, as mine would have been. Then the GM whips out a second Fate point and everyone is egging her on. She went for it. The mechanic worked. It got story where story would not have been.<br/><br/>Ryan: The problem isn't awesome dice, its awesome dice as a reward for player performance. Your post points out some of the dangers. That being said, even with awesome dice manipulations there's usually enough good stuff to make the game fun.

Reward systems that work well in a group -- where player A gets rewarded for doing something awesome, encouraging player B to step up and do something awesome too, which in turn gives player C an idea for something awesome <i>he</i> can do until everything explodes into a chain reaction of awesome -- don't really work well when the "group" is just two players.<br/><br/>Thing is, while I run one-player games pretty much out of necessity, I also <i>really like</i> the format. It's awesome running a game with <i>exactly one</i> main character. I've just never found a system that could handle that sort of game without a lot of tweaking, and for me "how do we keep one character alive in a game where all the math is based around a party of four?" is a lot easier to fix than "how do we deal with the fact that a large portion of this game is based around a social dynamic that simply doesn't exist in a game with only two people?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76193/#Comment_76193" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T07:15:29+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  7:15AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite> I don't need treats to compel my friends to be creative, engaged, and entertaining.</blockquote>\nJason - While I can see Sorcerer bonus dice as "treats", I've also seen them as a way to (a) acknowledge thematically relevant story-stuff and (b) "cement" that story-stuff into the fiction mechanically/thematically.

But I know we've had this conversation before and I just cannot seem to remember how it turned out.<br/><br/>See, because I know you like the fanmail mechanism in PTA.  And fanmail does just what you claim is not necessary.  You've made it pretty clear in the past that what you really don't like is when everyone isn't given the opportunity to reward the awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76209/#Comment_76209" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T09:15:42+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  9:15AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (throws fanmail at Eric) Fanmail's an explicit mechanism to tell you when you should be watching a movie instead of playing PTA.  It's a reward mechanic not just for the player entertaining his friends, but for the game as a whole.  It's organic and central to play.  The guy providing the adversity is not allowed to contribute, even though he ultimately benefits from it.

They allow the Guide to contribute, or not, to the pool for the next roll. If they choose not to then the Bonus Dice could just be made up of setting elements and traits.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are aiming to get 3 of these dice and there are many ways to get them. The one that is closest to, but not actually, "awesome" dice is the option for "something that the Guide judges to be very true to life, creative or well done". That doesn't say flashy, cinematic or "awesome". And I see them as the Guide affirming something that otherwise they might have wanted to suggest, really, or hadn't thought of but it just hits the spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a similar element on getting re-roll dice too. But I don't think they foster posturing or flashy description per se. They are trying to find a way to reward story elements that are "very true to life, creative or well done" as judged by the Guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can't really reward one player over another in BTI when you're the Guide, since you only have one Active Player. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
