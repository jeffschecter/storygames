If not, you should read it.<br/><br/>I have this overwhelming desire to run something that's basically Scream + Gossip Girl + The Long Halloween, set in Gotham city about 5 years after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Dark_Victory" rel="nofollow">Dark Victory</a>, when Robin's a bit older, but Gotham is still in transition from the gangsters of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Year_One" rel="nofollow">Year One</a> to the crazy masked villains that appear later.  Here's my basic premise:<br/><br/><i>Gotham Academy is a preparatory school for the children of Gotham City's wealthiest and most famous citizens.  Even current Wayne Enterprises chairman, Bruce Wayne, is among the school's prestigious alumni.  But this year, things at "The G.A." are different.  It began in September, when Luciano Falcone -- the young scion of a formerly notorious crime family that has since "gone legit" -- was killed over the Labor Day weekend.  The murderer used a .22 caliber pistol and left a UAW pamphlet at the scene. While the police have emphasized that the killer is probably involved in a work-related dispute with Falcone Industries, the rumor on the street (and in the school hallways) is that Luciano was dispatched by the notorious "Holiday Killer," though all previous suspects in that serial murder case are now dead.  Which of Gotham's young elite will be the next victim, with Halloween arriving soon?</i><br/><br/>Characters:<br/>- Luciano's siblings<br/>- children of other Batman characters and villains?<br/>- other kids at Gotham Academy<br/>- maybe Robin, going undercover as an academy student?<br/><br/>NPCs:<br/>- Bruce Wayne / The Batman<br/>- Commissioner Gordon<br/>- the detective assigned to the case<br/><br/>Basically, at least one character (major or minor) will die every school holiday until the next September, when the Holiday Killer will be revealed or there will be a climactic confrontation of some sort.  I'm imagining each session of play will probably last two "months" of time in the game world, showing two separate killings.  Play would take place over six sessions, then.<br/><br/>I want the game to develop in the way of an exciting mystery, with lots of clues and red herrings and the like, but I don't want the GM to decide what's really going on and for the players to gradually figure that out.  In fact, it would be great if there was a great deal of ambiguity in the end about who the Holiday Killer actually was, while still finding a fitting end to the series. The mystery should be emergent from various character contributions, but still not be all over the place.  Have we figured out how to do that yet?  <br/><br/>Seems like the Gumshoe system really isn't what I'm looking for.  Maybe a modified version of PTA?  Not sure how that would handle characters constantly being killed or if it would helpfully lead us to a satisfying conclusion.  Also, I'm worried that screen presence might get in the way of the story instead of supporting it.  Like, if the events of play clearly tell us who the next bit of play should be about, then if that character's screen presence is low in the next episode, it's weird.<br/><br/>Help?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179503/#Comment_179503" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T12:43:21+00:00" title="November 20, 2008 12:43PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have lots of systems choices, I think.  I wouldn't use Gumshoe for this, either, though.  I think I'd either end up with Unknown Armies or Over the Edge, personally.  Maybe Nemesis or Sorcerer?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the real core of success is going to be the characters (both PCs and NPCs) and setting, I think.  Getting the tone of the environment, of the student body, of the whole thing, plus having the characters invested in the premise and the lives of their fellow students/victims.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could do something like have each Player provide two NPC 'sketches' -- friends, relatives, or whatever of the PC -- one of whom the GM will choose to be implicated as a suspect, and one of which will be chosen as a victim.  In theory, one NPC could be used for both narrative purposes?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis feels like a very good scenario to use a Relationship Map with.  Or to do some heavy 'improv' allowing the character's investigations to 'drive' the solution to the mystery, instead of the GM actually working it out beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow.  This will be difficult to pull off, but epic if it works.  <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179512/#Comment_179512" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T13:05:48+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  1:05PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2008 1:06PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not that familiar with Over the Edge or Nemesis, but I feel like Unknown Armies, Over the Edge, and Sorcerer all have a lot of mechanics that we'd never really end up using. I was thinking more along the lines of starting with something really sparse, like PTA or <a href="http://www.harlekin-maus.com/games/shadows/shadows.html" rel="nofollow">Shadows</a>, and building it up from there. Shadows would be interesting because you could have one die represent what your character wants to have happen and other represent what the Holiday Killer wants, then roll them both to see what occurs.  That way, you would gradually define what Holiday's motives were as you went along, without them always being 100% successful.  And if the desires of Holiday started becoming too disunified, perhaps you could decide that there were multiple Holiday Killers.<br><br>I totally agree that, more important than the system, the various characters and locations and pacing and color are the most significant parts.  Seems like having players define NPCs or "sets / locations" could be critical.  A relationship map would be cool, but I'd also want it to evolve and develop over the course of play, not be static from the beginning.  Like, what if we discover that Luciano Falcone's father wasn't actually a member of the Falcone crime family!  That changes everything!  Is there a way to work those kinds of revelations into a relationship map or the mechanics of the game?  Or should they just emerge from the events of play?<br><br>Your point about suspects and victims is interesting.  Ideally, one way that suspects are narrowed down is that some of them will get killed.  I'm not sure if PCs should be totally immune to that either, though clearly killing more than a couple is probably not necessary.  Perhaps player-defined NPCs (which they may or may not play during earlier scenes) could serve as back-up PCs in case primary characters get killed?  So a single player should never lose all their NPCs or, if they do, their PC might be safe.  I don't know, something like that might work.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179520/#Comment_179520" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T13:29:29+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  1:29PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2008 1:31PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also:<br><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/gotham.jpg"/><br>I definitely think Bruce Wayne has sent his young ward, Dick Grayson (Robin), to Gotham Academy.

And yes, Dick should definitely be there, either as a well established student, or a new young turk just off the bus -- possibly undercover and under close direction of his mentor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mechanics for OtE are actually very very sparse -- most of the book is the setting, which was actually developed emergently in play by the writers and playtesters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also has some support for weird, low level superhuman abilities, which I think would add to and not necessarily overwhelm the setting.  That's also why I suggested UA.  Not because the magic stuff is useful at all, but because the core character generation/percentile system plus the madness meters would model the general gritty creepiness of the setting.  IMHO, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nShrug.  It sounds like you want to make the social aspects a bit more mechanical, though.  I definitely think that the relationship map -- if there is one -- should largely develop in play.  Basically, you may have a simple map that 'everybody knows', but it will mutate and develop into something very different by the end of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I can't help but note that just because you've been killed doesn't mean you weren't guilty of something.
