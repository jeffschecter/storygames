For example, Baker analyzes a generic tabletop system circa 1990 as follows: \n<blockquote><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/diceclouds/dice-to-cloud.jpg"/><br/>If you roll 10+, your character hits mine.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/diceclouds/dice-to-dice.jpg"/><br/>...And you mark 2d6 hit points off my character sheet.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/diceclouds/dice-to-cloud.jpg"/><br/>...And if it's 8 or more hit points, your character knocks my character down.<br/></blockquote>\nNote that he says that marking off 2d6 hit points is purely abstract, dice-to-dice - i.e. it involves modification of stats but does not impact the fiction.  Justin, however, suggests that this depends on the particular mechanic.  Many formal mechanics have an <i>inherent</i> fiction meaning, because they are associated.  Suppose this is GURPS, and the character has 16 hit points.  If I say "Take 2 hit point damage" or "Take 12 hit points damage" - either of these immediately convey some fictional meaning, even if I don't add any other verbal description.  The players might not picture the same details, but they know that the former is a blow that did not land solidly - whereas the latter was a very damaging blow.  By comparison, if I say "Lose one Fate Point", that has no fictional meaning - i.e. it is not associated with the fiction.  <br/><br/>A good case for this is <i>range</i>.  For example, a mechanic might say that you have a +2 if the opponent is closer than 30 feet away.  Now, if we are using a hex map and miniatures, then the range modifier is a formal interaction - i.e. dice-to-dice.  However, if we are only using verbal descriptions, then the range might be a part of the cloud - in which case the range modifier is cloud-to-dice.  I think a vital part of this, however, is that the range is associated.  Even if it is formally noted, it has a fictional meaning.  <br/><br/>Any thoughts on this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332504/#Comment_332504" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T11:06:32+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 11:06AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure.

He's talking about rules specifically. Marking 2d6 hit points on my sheet happens at the table and is in the rules, it does not change the fiction in any meaningful way (the glancing hit/damaging blow is simply "colour", ie. it's not part of the system's currency). Now, if I have 10 HP total and that 2d6 hit took me to 2, which informs me to run away, I guess then that could be called a leftward-pointing arrow, like:<br/>{I realize I'm losing and retreat}&lt;-----[I have only 20% of my HP left]<br/>But that's &lt;i&gt;not a rule.

We had some discussion of this <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14261" rel="nofollow">recently</a>, and two more terms have cropped up that may be useful.<br/><br/>To re-cap:<br/><b><i>Fictional Position</i></b>: generating events or resources in a purely fiction manner (ie through narration, in-character descriptions or other elements of free play) that give your character effectiveness to overcome obstacles and challenges. May or may not connect to mechanical effectiveness.<br/><br/>New stuff:<br/><b>Tactical Positioning:</b> interacting with mechanics in ways that affect player or character effectiveness. For example, choosing a weapon which has a stronger attack or longer reach than another, or choosing to use a power that affects another character or element in the game world. The act engaging of or the relative state of mechanical effectiveness wielded by a player on behalf of a character or other element of a game.<br/><br/><b>Geographic Positioning:</b> moving pieces about on a board or other abstraction of the game world or fiction narrative. For example, knights and pawns on a chess board, or a mini on a D&amp;D map. The real spacial relationship between the game pieces has bearing and effect on the fictional elements they are related to or represent. <br/><br/>Disassociated mechanics have weak or no fictional positioning behind them. Games with no fiction often rely strongly on geographic positioning to determine the tactical positioning.<br/><br/>Range crosses this: it uses fictional positioning to give you tactical advantage. But it is often very weakly held (eg you don't have to describe the battlefield to say you are medium range).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332550/#Comment_332550" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T13:36:29+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  1:36PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2011 2:13PM by Emily_Care.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

I'm going to posit that, he's making very granular claims about dissociation between mechanics and fiction. I bet if we take a close look at many of the games, there is an extremely strong link between what is made in the fiction and the mechanics that are triggered. What they may not be is represented in a detailed fashion by specific mechanically empowered symbols. Though he's also pointing out 4e which is as detailed as you can get. <br/><br/>Also, are games that have no or minimal mechanics that are triggered not role playing games? That seems to run counter to his idea that is is the role that makes a game an rpg. Now, the idea that in a game where you never actually play a role, that seems much more convincing. But if the issues is the relationship between what is narrated and mechanical effectiveness, I'm not sure that I agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332571/#Comment_332571" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T17:20:41+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  5:20PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanics and system structures add to the natural language - which is used to express both game and fiction.

In Microscope, each creation of a period, event or scene feeds into all the fiction that follows, and fulfills the mechanical procedures (though it has not quantifiable or computable effect on other mechanics). But enough snarkiness.<br/><br/>My question for all of this is how 1:1 does the association have to be to be associated. Range is a middle ground, as are hit points: they imply fiction, but as Griffen said, the range of how much or how little can be narrated based upon them is broad. However, if what's narrated matters to the mechanics (ie you can or cannot go aggro based upon your fictional actions) then is that what makes it more associated? I see three things here:<br/><br/>1) meshing of expectations about the game world with implied effects of the mechanics (that's the 4e Rogue example: shouldn't a Rogue be able to be sneaky more than once a day? But a certain power is a daily, so no.)<br/>2) feedback between fiction and mechanics (that's Vincent is talking about in Apocalypse World, especially here (<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=455" rel="nofollow">Adequacy, Cause and Effect</a>)<br/>3) representation of mechanical elements giving effectiveness based on the game world (I think that is what Justin is saying is missing from Wu Shu, Dread, Microscope and others)<br/><br/>Range, per se, fits in fine with 1 and 3, but is often weak in 2.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>I think the important thing is that the associated/dissociated difference affects investment in the character-and-game-world fiction.</blockquote>\nJohn, I see several mechanisms being pointed at that create this which are contradictory. Also, investment in character &amp; game world fiction, is a dicey measurement.

You imply that reading the effects into the fiction is a separate step that happens after the mechanical interplay is over.  For associated mechanics, reading the effects into the fiction is automatic and happens as the mechanical interplay is happening.  The players may add some extra non-mechanical description to provide further color, but there is a lot of information that is conveyed without any additional step.  In my experience, it is not uncommon that no such extra color is added - i.e. the players are satisfied with causing 12 hit points of damage with a sword blow as sufficient description.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>Dogs creates a dynamic that V. intends to make the players ask for this kind of specific moment-to-moment fictional information. AW even more so.</blockquote>\nI'll buy this.  The question of investment in the fiction isn't my own point, though.  It's a topic that Vincent is talking about in the dice-and-clouds discussion.  Vincent writes: \n<blockquote>It's the heart of Frank Tarcikowski's complaint from that Forge thread:<br/><br/><i>...I'm saying that one should invest in the SIS, and specifically, in Situation, moment-by-moment. Who's there, what's going on, what does it look like, sound like, feel like? In my experience, if you have a game system that works perfectly well without investing much in the SIS, people may tend to rush the story and their imagination of the actual in-game situation gets rather blurry. Such games still sound great in a write-up but to me, they're leaving a bad taste, like reading a good book way too fast.</i><br/><br/>My experience matches Frank's.</blockquote>\nI think that if you are analyzing how well the game system works without investing in the fiction (SIS), then you need to consider how closely the mechanics are associated with the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332739/#Comment_332739" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T10:14:02+00:00" title="July  1, 2011 10:14AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey, John's last comment just made me think of something at least slightly more productive to contribute!<br/><br/>Something I've noticed on a couple of occasions is that I'll play a game, and while, looking back on it, the fiction we created was perfectly fine and interesting, the <i>process of play</i>, moment-by-moment, wasn't all that fun, or at least not consistently.

It's a statement about what happens on the character sheet. You seem to think that players invariably and infallibly translate this mechanical notation into a fictional statement, but my experience differs from that. I've been in plenty of AD&amp;D 2e fights where someone did x points of damage, and nobody said anything about the fictional impact of that (and I didn't imagine any, myself). In these games, due to the way attacks work in D&amp;D, I didn't even know what the target did to try and block the attack. That's impossible in Dogs (see Vincent's examples in those threads).<br/><br/>Now--D&amp;D combat is actually the least problematic case, because you are required to provide at least some input. "I attack with my sword" is, at least to a certain degree, a fictional statement.  But what about "I use my Persuasion", "Okay, make the roll," "I got a 16", "Alright, you change his attitude toward you by one degree."  What happened just there was all dice and no clouds. You can say that stuff is implied there, again, but I've seen this happen without the players drawing any fictional content from that. And notice what Vincent is saying, too: he simply LIKES games where this isn't possible, where such actions have to be tied strongly into the game's fiction.  It doesn't mean that doing this is wrongbadfun or bad game design.  This dice and clouds thing is simply ONE analytical model, arbitrary as they all are, to be judged by its utility.  I find it very useful for identifying what I like in game mechanics.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I really don't understand what you mean by ignoring the fictional impact.

They go through the mechanical options, but they don't stop and imagine what's actually happening. And if they do, a) everyone's image is in their heads and probably differs from each other, and b) those disparate fictional things have no bearing on what happens in the game from thereon out.  <br/><br/>Notice Ralph's objections in those threads here as well: he automatically, always, imagines fictional content. And he's perfectly happy having movies play in his head even when the mechanics are really abstract and don't require any fictional tie-in.  That's great!  But it's not me, and it's not bizarre at all that this doesn't happen for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332758/#Comment_332758" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T11:29:32+00:00" title="July  1, 2011 11:29AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, um, John's manufactured a disagreement between me and Justin by building a straw man out of what I "seem to be implying," out of context.

It's a statement about what happens on the character sheet. You seem to think that players invariably and infallibly translate this mechanical notation into a fictional statement, but my experience differs from that. I've been in plenty of AD&amp;D 2e fights where someone did x points of damage, and nobody said anything about the fictional impact of that (and I didn't imagine any, myself). In these games, due to the way attacks work in D&amp;D, I didn't even know what the target did to try and block the attack. That's impossible in Dogs (see Vincent's examples in those threads).</blockquote>\nI don't agree here at all.  For example, "I successfully pick the lock" is a statement added to the fiction.  It doesn't specify how I picked the lock - maybe I pressed on the tumblers, maybe I slipped a credit card in to jimmy the latch, or maybe I just put pressure in the right way for the bolt to pop.  Even if I don't specify that extra detail, though, it is still a information added to the fiction that the lock is now open due to my efforts.  <br/><br/>In the same way, "I deal him a damaging blow with my sword" is a statement added to the fiction.  The way in which it happened might not be specified.  I might have lunged to stab him, or swung a blow the slashed his leg, or various other possibilities.  However, even if I don't specify that detail, the fact that I used my sword and he is now damaged as a result of that use is fictional information.  <br/><br/>Similarly, "I punch you" is a fictional statement.  In GURPS, it is a distinct mechanical option (a punch has a different roll than a kick).  So by specifying the "punch" mechanical option and the person you are targeting, you have given the information "I punch you."  By the same token, "I punch you" could be the description added to a See attempt in DitV.  (Indeed, that is part of the rules examples DitV p60.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332785/#Comment_332785" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T13:15:00+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  1:15PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, there are plenty of examples where this is true.

You have improved relations with the specified NPC, perhaps from "Neutral" to "Friendly".  This is just like a lockpick or punch - we don't know what the character said to accomplish it, but somehow the PC engaged in conversation with the NPC and ingratiated himself to him.  That is still information - a general idea of what was done, and a general idea of the result, and thus has an impact on the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333279/#Comment_333279" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T19:50:36+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  7:50PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe we can find middle ground in saying that rather than being a yes/no thing, it's a matter of degree or quality?

My <i>AW</i> group.  We said "we like color".  We brought a fair amount of it at times.  The advice in the book supported us.  And yet, there were a lot of times in play where a player wanted the situation to move forward, and because that's what the die mechanics do, they just picked up the dice, stated the move they were using, and rolled.  Matt and I would jump in and ask for more description, but if we hadn't been there, it wouldn't have happened.  The only fiction it's literally impossible to omit if you want to use the Manipulate tool is the word "manipulate".<br/><br/>Now, this is true in <i>D&amp;D</i> too, for something like lock-picking.  And, in fact, lock-picking often proceeds without further description.<br/><br/>But, if you're like me, you're much less likely to wonder about the specifics of jamming picks into locks than you are about manipulating someone.  The latter is more dramatic and variable and takes longer.  The less of that drama and specificity and time that's actually represented in our speech, the more dissociated the mechanics-use feels.<br/><br/>Personally, I find that resolving first and narrating second is a huge factor in this discussion.  <br/><br/>If my roll only resolves whether I open the lock or don't, the outcome is simultaneous in fiction and mechanism.  "Crap!  I couldn't pick it!" is the same reaction of the player at the table and the character in the fiction.<br/><br/>But, if the acting player loses and I win narration rights in <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, I can say, "You don't get her to come with you... and in fact, she winds up leaving with your backpack!"  Now there's a huge gap from the fictional situation before the mechanic was employed to what's been resolved.  We then jump back in time to that moment and roleplay toward the resolution.  "Sure, I'll come with you... when you're the king!  For now, I'll reclaim the real king's rightful property and bid you good day."  However many seconds that took to speak, we all knew where it had to go, and the acting player knew that any attempts at struggle weren't allowed to work.  <i>That's</i> a dissociating experience right there.<br/><br/>I'm busting out these relatively subtle moments to try to narrow down where the line of dissociation lies.  "I roll my numbers to affect your numbers, we dunno what that even means in the fiction," is obvious.  I'm more interested in the finer stuff, where one person says <i>PtA</i> is the best roleplaying and another says it's not roleplaying at all.<br/><br/>Is a certain amount of dissociation inherent to instantly resolving subjects broader than minute tasks? <br/><br/>I'm working on a system where each task roll factors into an issue of the sort typically addressed by conflict resolution mechanics.  Perhaps that could be an association-saving bridge for some.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334432/#Comment_334432" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T05:43:08+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  5:43AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, in my experience, your Seduce / Manipulate example is not uncommon. Even among groups who have read the AW rules and have played multiple sessions. I don't know why this is but I have a few guesses. That said, here is my understanding of how Vincent intended Seduce / Manipulate to work in play.<br/><br/>To use Seduce / Manipulate, a player needs fictional leverage (a relevant promise or threat), otherwise the mechanical results of the roll can be confusing to implement because they may bounce back and forth between mechanics and fiction. And if the fiction isn't defined, some of the mechanics won't make sense. <br/><br/>Here is a problematic example using the PC vs. NPC rules:<br/><br/>- Bob wants Anna to give him the passcode.<br/>- Bob says, "I manipulate Anna" and rolls.<br/>- On a 10+, whether Bob keeps his promise is up to him.<br/>- On 7-9, Anna needs some concrete assurance right now.<br/><br/>Without fictional leverage, what is the promise on the 10+ result? Without fictional leverage, what is the assurance on a 7-9 result? <br/><br/>Here is a problematic example using the PC vs. PC rules:<br/><br/>- Bob wants Anna to give him the passcode.<br/>- Bob says, "I manipulate Anna" and rolls.<br/>- On 7-9, Anna chooses one of the following:<br/>- &gt; if she does what Bob wants, she marks XP.<br/>-&gt; if she doesn't, she acts under fire.<br/><br/>Without fictional leverage, how does Anna choose between these two options? If Bob says, "give me the passcodes and I will give you the healing medicine your sick mom needs", then Anna might say, "sweet, XP and a healthy mom!" Without fictional leverage, the acting under fire option also becomes confusing. If Bob's leverage was a threat, "give me the passcodes or I will tell Jack you cheated on him", then acting under fire has a lot more juicy context. That said, unlike the PC vs. NPC example, the need for leverage isn't as obvious. I can still technically choose between the two options without fictional leverage, even if it is a bit wonky. Do I give something up in exchange for XP or do I refuse and potentially pay a price? Although that price is unclear without the context of fictional leverage. <br/><br/>It's unclear why Seduce / Manipulate is used by many without leverage. The book itself lays out how leverage works. Maybe because the handouts that summarize Seduce / Manipulate don't mention leverage? And the handouts are what most players will reference, not the book itself? But even if that's true, using the NPC results don't make sense without leverage. Are people using the PC results, even when seducing / manipulating NPCs (could be because the PC results are clearly listed as bullet points and the NPC results are embedded in the move description)? Maybe because in other games, social rolls don't require leverage, so AW is bumping against pre-existing assumptions? <br/><br/>That all said, AW when played as intended, I believe is an example where fictional description is required for some of its mechanics to work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334456/#Comment_334456" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T09:28:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  9:28AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2011 9:48AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's unclear why Seduce / Manipulate is used by many without leverage.</blockquote>I have a guess.  I think it's because, in AW, there are two play situations in which you roll, and the second one is ripe for this.<br/><br/>1) When you do something in the fiction that counts as a move.  This is super on the association front.  This is how I played the game; I just played my character, and let the MC worry about telling me to roll dice.<br/><br/>2) When you don't know what to roleplay.  When you're not sure what you want to do with your character.  When a scene gets stale or trivial.  When you feel stuck.  When your character wants something, but you have no idea how they'd pursue it in-fiction.  In my group, this is when the moves did their heavy lifting, when they most obviously made a strong contribution to play.  <i>Things are getting dull... roll a move... yay, things are interesting again!</i>  It's also an easy out for lazy players.  Rather than really tackling a fictional situation in character and making strong choices, they can just wimp out and let the mechanics do the work.  ("I have Hot +3, I wanna roll Manipulate.")  Only once the mechanics are giving them feedback (or are right about to) can they muster enough energy to choose within the fiction.  "Oh yeah.  Leverage?  I guess... uh, maybe the water thing...  yeah, that's it.  I bring your camp your water, bitch!  Don't make me reconsider!"<br/><br/>Maybe all resolution rules that actually provide value run the risk of becoming crutches.  I dunno.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to think that scale and timing matters, as per my previous post.<br/><br/>There's also the issue of letting game quantities (Hot +3) instead of fictional quantities (does this NPC seem easier to intimidate or manipulate?) inform player decisions.  Because, for players inclined to use crutches, "inform" can move all the way to "dictate".  "Now that I've decided to Manipulate, what do I have to attend to in-fiction?"  The causality in play (choose move -&gt; generate required fiction) defines the player experience (and risks a sort of weird feeling*) much more than the causality in the fiction alone (generate required fiction -&gt; receive outcome of move).<br/><br/>*probably not dissociation as Justin uses the term, but I dunno                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334468/#Comment_334468" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T10:47:55+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 10:47AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>It's unclear why Seduce / Manipulate is used by many without leverage. ...

Most people think of "manipulating" as convincing someone to do something for no cost though clever communication, not as an exchange of things of value like Vincent defines it in Apocalypse World. Seducing is even more problematic, since most people use it with a definition that's nearly the opposite of the one AW uses. Since AW is fighting people's existing definitions, the "pattern-matching on the fiction" part of the move isn't functioning as well as the moves that are based around AW-specific terms that people don't already use in other contexts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334477/#Comment_334477" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T11:44:18+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 11:44AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2011 12:14PM by jenskot.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point Dan!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the reasons people confuse Go Aggro with Seize by Force is the names.

But I don't think it is because of the players. In a situation where players...<br/>\n<br/>\n- don't know what they want to do<br/>\n- are bored because a scene feels stale<br/>\n- want something but don't know how to get it<br/>\n<br/>\n...don't sound like situations where the players need to stop describing fiction and turn completely to mechanics minus fiction. It sounds like a situation where the GM may need to step in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the players don't know what to do, the book tells the GM to make a soft move, "you can see armed gangers in the far distance riding in your direction looking angry, about 15 minutes away" and then ask the players, "what do you do?" If they players still don't do anything, then the GM makes a hard move, "when the gangers arrive, they start looting your homes" and then ask the players, "what do you do?" If the players still don't do anything, keep making moves (like they take your stuff). If the players sit back and do nothing the entire time, there may be a bigger problem going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn't sound like it, but maybe it's lack of familiarity with the rules? Maybe the GM needs to do a little prompting at start to give players ideas. If a player want to manipulate an NPC but has no idea what leverage would be appropriate and feel stuck, maybe the GM could hint that Reading the NPC or Situation might reveal options. If you find out that Anna's mom needs medicine, and you could potentially use that as leverage to get Anna to give you something you want, then you set off a series of events that feedback into the fiction. The players could ask the GM, "where do we get medicine?" The GM could turn the question back to the players and ask, "last time you needed medicine, where did you get it?" or answer in a way that sets up additional situations, "Chris who you got into a fist fight last week stole a bunch of medicine from a neighboring town."<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, the GM is framing / prompting / making moves that realign the players with the fiction where instead of falling back on mechanics without fiction, they are describing fiction that triggers mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if the players' style is one that requires mechanical feedback to get them thinking fictionally, then possibly leading with a Read a Person / Situation move could be a fallback option to get play started.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334499/#Comment_334499" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T12:58:07+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 12:58PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2011 1:02PM by Emily_Care.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>It's a weird thing.  My<i>AW</i>group.  We said "we like color".  We brought a fair amount of it at times.  The advice in the book supported us.  And yet, there were a lot of times in play where a player wanted the situation to move forward, and because that's what the die mechanics do, they just picked up the dice, stated the move they were using, and rolled.  Matt and I would jump in and ask for more description, but if we hadn't been there, it wouldn't have happened.  The only fiction it's literally impossible to omit if you want to use the Manipulate tool is the word "manipulate".</blockquote>\nTons of good discussion here already. Another aspect you may have noted is that the GM is the one who decides whether a move can be invoked or not, based on what actions have been described.\n<blockquote><cite>From page 12, Moves &amp; Dice:</cite>"When a player says that her character does something listed as a move, that\u2019s when she rolls, and that\u2019s the only time she does. The rule for moves is to do it, do it. In order for it to be a move and for the player to roll dice, the character has to do something that counts as that move; and whenever the character does something that counts."</blockquote>\nAnd later:\n<blockquote>"Usually it\u2019s unambiguous: \u201cdammit, I guess I crawl out there. I try to keep my head down. I\u2019m doing it under fire?\u201d \u201cYep.\u201d But there are two ways they sometimes don\u2019t line up, and it\u2019s your job as MC to deal with them.<br><br>First is when a player says only that her character makes a move, without having her character actually take any such action. For instance: \u201cI go aggro on him.\u201d Your answer then should be \u201ccool, what do you do?\u201d \u201cI seize the radio by force.\u201d \u201cCool, what do you do?\u201d \u201cI try to seduce him.\u201d \u201cCool, what do you do?\u201d</br></br></blockquote>\nThat unassuming "Cool, what do you do?" is the unequivocal, locked-down, iron clad tool you have as a GM. If the player responds with something that doesn't fit the move, they don't get to roll. <br><br>So, sounds like you were doing just the right thing, but it felt awkward. Makes sense. And if there were moments when the roll got made without that and there was a break in the fiction, it was because the GM wasn't being the gatekeeper they are intended to be.<br><br>And re: seducing or manipulating, those are both descriptions of <b>outcomes</b> of actions one takes.

In particular, the choices that are offered with each move are discrete in a way that can be hard to map with in-character thoughts and actions.  <br><br>For example, as a player I might say "I burst into the room with my shotgun out and say 'No one move a muscle or I blow you away!' ".  The GM might interpret this as going Aggro.  However, I roll a 9 and so the opponent has a choice and chooses to back off slowly.  However, that doesn't fit with what I was doing.  In character, I intend to shoot anyone who moves.  <br><br>I'm sure there are different ways to handle this - but I think it can get tricky.  <br><br>To go back to the general question of dissociation, I think one of the key parts of dissociation is having the player make out-of-character *choices*.  That is, asking me to roll a die is demanding an out-of-character action - but it isn't necessarily dissociation in Justin Alexander's sense.  However, if I have to choose a mechanical option out-of-character, that is likely to be dissociative.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334536/#Comment_334536" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T16:59:17+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  4:59PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see your example as a problem at all - the choice for Go Aggro is "give you something <b>they think</b> you want". Yeah, you intended one thing. You didn't get it.<br><br>Perhaps that speaks to the disconnect. AW is not that kind of game, the kind where you win and get exactly what you wanted. Those NPCs are people, and even when you win, they do what they would do.<br><br>The whole "what's dissociative" question is kind of bullshit. It's so subjective and individual as to be worthless as a guide to evaluating texts or examples of play. As with so much of this sort of question, it comes down to: "did the fiction do what I expected it to? No?

I mean, he could easily have been more coercive, but I didn't find that desirable or necessary; there was always <i>something</i> to deal with.  ("Things are getting dull" wasn't the best phrasing.  "I am uninspired" is better.)  Players just couldn't always make up their minds how to address things in-character, so they chose actions by scanning their character sheets and the Moves list.  For some, the list became the only toolkit for responding to fictional situations, rather than thinking from within the fiction, "How do I respond?"

Dissociation is one such experience, and I don't think it's independent of techniques at all.  "Choose a mechanical option OOC" doesn't have to be <i>bad</i>, but it does describe a different experience than choosing in-character.<br/><br/>How do games get us to make what kinds of choices?

"I am uninspired" is better.)  Players just couldn't always make up their minds how to address things in-character, so they chose actions by scanning their character sheets and the Moves list.

Not the solution though. <br/><br/>One thing I've noticed in AW is that, as a player, I'm happiest when I get lots of room to develop and pursue my own agendas. The more proactive the GM is the more boxed in I have felt. Don't know how this interacts with your issues. But the world of AW is so heinous and fraught with peril, I feel like players need lots of fictional rope to hang invest in so that they are engaged when it gets used to hang them. So don't beat yourself up about working on the fronts, Matt. There should be plenty of room there to follow through on what players develop, and then just tweak it in that bad, things have gone to hell kind of way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334611/#Comment_334611" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T07:52:09+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  7:52AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2011 7:53AM by Emily_Care.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I think the term "dissociation" comes across as a little too pejorative.

Many of which are present in all games, as was mentioned up thread. <br/><br/>The analysis is careful about 4e. Though what are the limitations on how often a fireball can be cast in 2nd edition, 3rd? 3.5? I honestly don't know but I'd be surprised if there were none. And then given those limits, how are they legitimized within the fiction? For example, how does it make sense that one would forget a spell after casting it, so you have to memorize it again. Forgetting I can believe, but forgetting triggered by doing the action? Not over time or disuses? Are we just fighting about what is realistic all over again? \n<blockquote><cite> From <a href="http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/dissociated-mechanics.html" rel="nofollow">dissociated games post</a></cite>If you're watching a football game, for example, and a player makes an amazing one-handed catch, you don't think to yourself: "Wow, they won't be able to do that again until tomorrow!"</blockquote>\nIt does seem like a sally in the edition wars. Let us compare. In a random sample of the d20 srd, Appraisal. Here is the text:\n<blockquote>Action<br/>Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).<br/><br/>Try Again<br/>No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success.</blockquote>\n1 minute, sure. Plausible. Never try again on the same object? Riddle me that in terms of the fiction. No, it's a rule created for game balance or playability issues. That is at the heart of the argument made about 4e. That's a fine analysis. It can be extended to other games.

You're trying to bring up Fireball, Appraisal, and Edition Wars to imply that his dislike of 4e's Trick Strike and similar mechanics is irrational.  i.e. He really has no reason to dislike the Trick Strike daily power, but rather has an ulterior motive and is inventing a meaningless distinction to justify it.  <br/><br/>Personally, I believe that he is correctly portraying his preferences, and that his distinction is meaningful.  I say this because I had roughly the same reaction to 4th edition D&amp;D, and used similar words when explaining it.  Even if the distinction isn't important to everyone, it exists and is important to him.  Now, Justin certainly portrays 4e in a negative light while explaining his preference, but he at least admits in principle that there are people who could reasonably like it.  <br/><br/>To comment on your examples...  I think the case of Appraisal is indeed justified in the fiction, and is not at all a game balance issue. There is no problem of game balance to allow re-rolls of Appraisal.  Other skills like Disable Device or Search allow rerolls and/or the Take 20 option.  Rather, it is an issue of representation.  Staring at an object for a long time does not give you a better idea of its worth.  Regardless, even if you did bring up genuinely dissociated mechanics within 3rd edition D&amp;D, I don't see how that bears on the premise that dissociation is a real distinction, and affects some people's preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334680/#Comment_334680" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T13:56:03+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  1:56PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.  Interesting stuff.<br/><br/>I feel like an important thing hasn't come up, because everyone's been talking about "the fiction".  I'd rather use the associated term, "Shared Imagined Space."  What this gains us is that fundamental word there -- "Shared".<br/><br/>"Take 12 points of damage" may have some impact on the fictions, or it may not.  But, generally speaking, it doesn't have an impact on the *Shared* Imagined Space.  The DM might think the guy busted his nose; the player might think he dented his shield.  The fictions, if they are present, are not shared.  There's no element of synchronization, generally.<br/><br/>I think that's more of the key issue with games like DitV and AW -- it's not that they have particularly robust or high-resolution SIS.  It's that there are numerous layers of mechanics to keep all the players' fictions synchronized, all Shared.  It's more about keeping everyone's personal cloud overlapping with everyone else's than it is about how big those clouds are, or what's in them.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, the trick, really, isn't around getting all excited and intense about the arrows going into the clouds.  To some extent, those kinda take care of themselves, once the rest is in place.  The trick, really, is to get all excited and intense about the arrows coming out of the clouds -- the way the SIS informs the mechanics, and the way the mechanics are dependent on the SIS.  One, I think, also has to be wary of arrows that just loop around from dice-to-dice, without touching intimately on the SIS at all.<br/><br/>Most versions of D&amp;D generally work just fine if you short-circuit the SIS and run it dice-to-dice.  Indeed, in some versions, the rules seem to go out of their way to make it harder to incorporate the SIS.  If you have 4 hit points and you take 3 hit points of damage, are you seriously-wounded?  If you are seriously-wounded, then why does Cure Light Wounds make you just fine?  If you have 98 hit points and take 3 hit points of damage, did the arrow even break your skin?  What if the arrow was poisoned?  Etc etc etc.<br/><br/>AW is well-designed, generally, to crash hard if you try to short-circuit the intimate relationship with the SIS and run it dice-to-dice.  If you're doing just about anything, and you fail, the MC can pull any hard move they like.  But which one?  He can't decide if all you've said was "Yeah I totally go Seduce Batface."  Or if you're doing something under fire and you only hit, the MC can't offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>The MC moves here again serve to synchronize the SIS.  The example in the Harm section with Keeler and Bran and the shotgun makes it really clear how this comes together.  <br/><br/><br/>(I'm now going to get into the Appraisal aside, because even though it's wildly-off-topic (in my opinion) it's still bugging me and I feel compelled to speak to it.<br/><br/>Okay, here's the basic deal:  in standard d20, a roll like Appraisal would be a secret, behind-the-screen roll by the DM.  Because the character doesn't know whether he's Appraised something right or not, and you can't trust the players to not get all metagamey and just keep Appraising shit every minute for hours on end until they roll a 20.  If it's a secret roll, then re-Appraising is essentially pointless.<br/><br/>That's all.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334684/#Comment_334684" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T14:14:38+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  2:14PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2011 2:15PM by Emily_Care.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi John!<br/><br/>Sorry for the loud post this morning. I didn't meant to offend or disrespect him or you. Though I did a bad job at that for sure.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>Sure, but you're trying to de-legitimize Justin Alexander's preference.  You're trying to bring up Fireball, Appraisal, and Edition Wars to imply that his dislike of 4e's Trick Strike and similar mechanics is irrational.  i.e. He really has no reason to dislike the Trick Strike daily power, but rather has an ulterior motive and is inventing a meaningless distinction to justify it.</blockquote>\nI didn't intend to imply he was being irrational. Just inconsistent. \n<blockquote>Personally, I believe that he is correctly portraying his preferences, and that his distinction is meaningful.  I say this because I had roughly the same reaction to 4th edition D&amp;D, and used similar words when explaining it.  Even if the distinction isn't important to everyone, it exists and is important to him.  Now, Justin certainly portrays 4e in a negative light while explaining his preference, but he at least admits in principle that there are people who could reasonably like it.</blockquote>\nFair enough. I missed that he said that. I also agree that it's a perfectly reasonable reaction to have. I think his analysis is very good about how 4e works.  <br/><br/>I would disagree with you on the issue of appraisal (one could certainly do more research, learn more over time etc.) But, also, it is an example I take out of context. I have not played d20 extensively. Ah ha--the difference is that as I see it, the plausibility of Appraisal is not necessarily more than that of the Rogue skill. The distinction you, and Alexander, may be making is that when the choice was made, what people went to was the issue of what it would be like in the fiction, not (necessarily or primarily?) how it plays out mechanically. That makes good sense to me. \n<blockquote>Staring at an object for a long time does not give you a better idea of its worth. Regardless, even if you did bring up genuinely dissociated mechanics within 3rd edition D&amp;D, I don't see how that bears on the premise that dissociation is a real distinction, and affects some people's preferences.</blockquote>\nI definitely want to acknowledge preferences as an important aspect of play and design.\n<blockquote><cite>Emily wrote:</cite>If we're talking about functioning of play, of ability to engage, or even preference based on experience, have at it. But if preference and ability to engage are the final arbiters of quality or playability on a general level, it's not a useful analysis. It's an ideological polemic. </blockquote>\nIf I say I don't like a game because it has features x, y and z. Fine. If I say a game is broken or poorly designed, fine. If I say a game is broken or poorly designed because it has features x, y, and z that I don't like--that could be better established. If instead I said that since features x,y,z make it impossible for me to play because they do Q (ie break my immersion, make me bored, disrupt my thought process, aren't understandable) and furthermore, they do so for N other people, that's a good argument. And if z group of N other people are more happy with the features x, y and z. That then, is another matter that bears good looking at.<br/><br/>I guess that was the argument Jason may have been making. <br/><br/>And Roger: I agree. Great point about hit points. Basing mechanics on the background fiction (pre-SIS since it's not nec generated in play? hmmm.), plausibility and common-sense or real world analogs doesn't guarantee that you'll have to generate fictional events in the shared imagined space any more than using abstracted mechanics and cues does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334697/#Comment_334697" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T15:17:25+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  3:17PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>I feel like an important thing hasn't come up, because everyone's been talking about "the fiction".  I'd rather use the associated term, "Shared Imagined Space."  What this gains us is that fundamental word there -- "Shared".<br/><br/>"Take 12 points of damage" may have some impact on the fictions, or it may not.  But, generally speaking, it doesn't have an impact on the *Shared* Imagined Space.  The DM might think the guy busted his nose; the player might think he dented his shield.  The fictions, if they are present, are not shared.  There's no element of synchronization, generally.<br/><br/>I think that's more of the key issue with games like DitV and AW -- it's not that they have particularly robust or high-resolution SIS.  It's that there are numerous layers of mechanics to keep all the players' fictions synchronized, all Shared.  It's more about keeping everyone's personal cloud overlapping with everyone else's than it is about how big those clouds are, or what's in them.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, the trick, really, isn't around getting all excited and intense about the arrows going into the clouds.  To some extent, those kinda take care of themselves, once the rest is in place.  The trick, really, is to get all excited and intense about the arrows coming out of the clouds -- the way the SIS informs the mechanics, and the way the mechanics are dependent on the SIS.  One, I think, also has to be wary of arrows that just loop around from dice-to-dice, without touching intimately on the SIS at all.<br/></blockquote>\nI agree, I want to know how my character or another character is doing something so I can be there with them, especially if I am the GM in the type of game where it is possible to just say "I attack and do 12 points of damage" and its up to the GM to weave a ficton out of it -- thats hard work if the GM decides to take it on.   The GM could also choose to ignore the fiction and reply in kind, because its easier - "15 defence - you miss"   yawn....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334732/#Comment_334732" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T20:12:47+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  8:12PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>"Take 12 points of damage" may have some impact on the fictions, or it may not.

You might not value that information - which is a totally valid preference, but it is in fact shared information that other people may care about.

It doesn't specify how I picked the lock - maybe I pressed on the tumblers, maybe I slipped a credit card in to jimmy the latch, or maybe I just put pressure in the right way for the bolt to pop. Even if I don't specify that extra detail, though, it is still a information added to the fiction that the lock is now open due to my efforts.<br/><br/>In the same way, "I deal him a damaging blow with my sword" is a statement added to the fiction. The way in which it happened might not be specified. I might have lunged to stab him, or swung a blow the slashed his leg, or various other possibilities. However, even if I don't specify that detail, the fact that I used my sword and he is now damaged as a result of that use is fictional information.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334820/#Comment_334820" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T16:32:19+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  4:32PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2011 8:22PM by droog.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Regardless, even if you did bring up genuinely dissociated mechanics within 3rd edition D&amp;D, I don't see how that bears on the premise that dissociation is a real distinction, and affects some people's preferences.I</blockquote>\nBut then one has to say 'so what?'

That means that every part of the game is subject to analysis.  But just because we can discuss many different parts of the game doesn't mean that we shouldn't discuss one particular part.  <br/><br/>I'd say that Alexander's distinction is an important one not just individually for him, but that many people share this preference.  Because it is important to a significant block of people, I think it's useful to talk about.  <br/><br/>I'd be fine with discussing D&amp;D and your preferences where it has to do with this distinction.

I don't think there is any unified group of gamers who want the same thing.  Thus, I don't speak for anyone else, but I had a similar reaction as Alexander to 4th edition D&amp;D, and I also enjoy many games with in-character mechanics.  So I think I fall in this group and would answer for myself.  <br/><br/>1) What do I want?  I want lots of things - that question seems too vague to be answerable.  <br/>2) Do I have the world's best task-res system?  I don't think there is a world's best system of any kind, since "best" varies by personal preference.  I am still interested in new systems.  <br/>3) Whether the world neglects it doesn't have an answer since I said "no" to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/>4) I'd be happy to give tips for getting into character, but it needs to be in a specific context.  It's something I've discussed from time to time especially with larp groups.  <br/>5) Could it be stuff you didn't read in Dragon?  I'm not sure how to answer this.  I think, for example, that a lot of the articles from the Knutpunkt books over the last few years are about being in-character 100% and having only very rare OOC invocations at all.  Those are things that you aren't likely to have read in the Dragon 25 years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334867/#Comment_334867" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T23:02:17+00:00" title="July 16, 2011 11:02PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2011 11:19PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>If I say I don't like a game because it has features x, y and z.

That lets readers know a giant set of information that comes with "horror film" from prior familiarity, and then hones in on some features that narrow that down.  Why does the reviewer mention "gory and nonsensical"?  Because the reviewer knows that a substantial number of viewers will care about these, and see the film or not because of them.<br/><br/>For the purposes of <i>describing</i> games, that's really all we need to do here.  "Dissociative" strikes me as a fine but not indispensable addition to our review lexicon.<br/><br/>For <i>making games</i>, we probably need a clearer divide between methods and user responses.  "Extended conflict resolution tends to produce dissociation" strikes me as a useful observation which can then be taken or left as per the goals of the particular game in question.<br/><br/>Can we pursue observations like that here?

Yet, the mechanic is tied to the game world in ways that fit Justin's criteria for mechanics that aren't disassociated. In Dread, you pull from the Jenga tower when your character takes action in the game world. The amount of blocks you pull depends on who your character is and the situation that is occurring in the game world. The risk of the jenga tower falling grows as more blocks are pulled and literally becomes a physical manifestation of the growing danger and dread in the game world.<br/>\n<br/>\nDread is a huge hit among D&amp;D; players and an often cited reason is because it is so immersive. The game and the fiction feel very associated allowing players to delve deep into their characters and the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then, if so many people feel Dread is immersive and associative, and Dread fits Justin's criteria for associated games, then why does he feel Dread is a dissociated game (and thus not even something he would consider a roleplaying game)?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read his D&amp;D; 4E article on disassociated mechanics, I was nodding along, thinking "brilliant" and I immediately subscribed to his RSS feed. But the above Dread example throws it all into question for me.

Rather, it is up to the GM and players to come up with in-game reasons for the danger and dread to grow to match the condition of the stack of blocks.

The nature of dread in the horror genre is that the threat is often unseen and can lash out at you at any time. So the dread in the game may no be immediately obvious, but it is there. It's not the same as players coming up with good rationalizations for why they can only use Trick Shot once a day. The jenga tower represents the dread that exists in character, in the game world. There are pre-existing reasons for the growing danger and dread. Often that danger is embedded right into character creation itself. It's inescapable. You don't play Dread unless there is a growing danger. And you don't pull Jenga blocks if there is no growing danger that could end up killing you unexpectedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say Dread's main mechanic is one of the most directly associated mechanics I can think of in any RPG I have ever played. When I play Dread, everything feels hyper in character (in my opinion). The game and the fictional world are tightly interwoven.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334924/#Comment_334924" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T12:57:38+00:00" title="July 17, 2011 12:57PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said, I haven't played the game.

He put a lot of emphasis on Dread as an example and specifically said it would be a controversial one. But he seems to have chosen it specifically to make a point how there are games that seem like they are RPGs but aren't. So it's unclear if he mis-analyzed dread or perhaps I don't understand what he actually means by associated vs. disassociated mechanics. He was questioned in the comment section of that blog post but it seems his original observations about Dread remain intact despite evidence presented to the contrary. Which leads me to believe I don't clearly know what he really means by associated vs. disassociated mechanics or that his stance is inconsistent in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, I completely buy into the idea that some mechanics are more meta / out of character than others. But how meta / out of character a mechanic is doesn't necessarily equate to how fictionally immersive the mechanic feels (which is subjective).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334943/#Comment_334943" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T16:21:56+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  4:21PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel Cook had a blog post today that seems relevant to Dread.<br><br><a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2011/07/shadow-emotions-and-primary-emotions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lostgarden.com/2011/07/shadow-emotions-and-primary-emotions.html</a><br><br>The primary emotion of dread as you pull the jenga block bleeds into the secondary emotion of dread as your character faces the dreadful thing...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334945/#Comment_334945" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T16:30:42+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  4:30PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funnily enough, I found Dread like playing Jenga with a side-story.

Looking over Alexander's essay, I can't see anywhere that he talks about "not doing it for him" being the definition of dissociation, nor do I find a place where taking the game seriously is the definition of dissociation.  <br><br>His definition isn't cut-and-dried because while he specifies "association" between the mechanic and the game world, he doesn't precisely define what he means by association.  Instead, he tries to demonstrate by example.  Still, I think it is pretty clear from his discussion of the benefits of dissociation (specifically the dissociation in Wushu) that he doesn't define it by having a bad reaction to the game.  I haven't played Wushu, but I would say similarly about other games like Polaris.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335011/#Comment_335011" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T06:41:07+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  6:41AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I think you might prefer there to be a more detailed impact on the Shared Imagined Space - i.e. you want to know exactly where the hit was, etc.  However, the fact that character A used weapon B on character C to do damage X is definite information that is<b>shared</b>.  You might not value that information - which is a totally valid preference, but it is in fact shared information that other people may care about.

I mean, I know it didn't "really" happen; there's no real guy there swinging a real sword at a real orc.  But in the main it is a factual objective description of what the real players did with the real ('dice') mechanics of the game.  Bob rolled a 17 to hit and he rolled 12 points of damage.  The comparison which seems obvious to me is "Bob rolled a 7, moved seven spaces, landed on Boardwalk, and yay now he owes me $800.  Pay up, buddy."<br/><br/>So, yeah, spectrum of preference.

".  The GM might interpret this as going Aggro.  However, I roll a 9 and so the opponent has a choice and chooses to back off slowly.  However, that doesn't fit with what I was doing.  In character, I intend to shoot anyone who moves.</blockquote>\nSo, shoot him. How does that not fit? <br/><br/>You said, "Don't move or I'll shoot!" <br/><br/>You've cleverly painted the NPCs into a corner. If the GM chooses (unwisely - er, maybe wisely if he's "looking through crosshairs") to have an NPC move, why wouldn't you just shoot? He's not out of the scene or protected from further actions. He just didn't really listen to you. So, shoot him. The GM is essentially choosing something that is effectively the same as sucking it up. <br/><br/>Or, as Vincent said on the Apocalypse World forums: <br/><br/><i>When you go aggro on someone and hit with a 7-9, they have to choose something they can do, given the circumstances and the position you've put them in. If you can situationally eliminate options for them, you've gone aggro more effectively, even on the same roll.<br/><br/>The perfect go aggro, then, is the one where you've eliminated every 7-9 option except to cave or suck it up, so the 7-9 hit is the same as the 10+ hit. This is why it's good to have the guy against the wall, pinned, with your forearm across his throat and your gun in his mouth. Let's see him talk his way out of that.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335093/#Comment_335093" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T11:38:05+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 11:38AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep.

Alright, you're successful -- now the snake is prone."  In the abstract, yes, the character used the defined 'Trip' action which resulted in the defined 'Prone' condition.  But what that means concretely in the SIS, if anything, is likely to bear little resemblance to the literal non-terms-of-the-art day-to-day usage of the words.  It may also be the case that it just doesn't matter what's going on in the cloud of the SIS -- what's important is that the character used Trip and now the snake is Prone, which is all on the (abstracted) dice side of things.<br/><br/>But yeah, I think you're understanding what I'm saying here.  Of course, I don't confuse that with assuming that you agree with me, but we're speaking the same language.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335140/#Comment_335140" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T15:50:55+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  3:50PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>Or maybe that's not dissociation.

Maybe it's simply *shitty* arrows, and possibly shitty boxes\u2014which then lead to shitty (as in boring) clouds.  After all, there's plenty of back and forth from clouds to boxes and back in a 4E skill challenge.  It's just that the results tend to be lackluster because the nature of the interactions themselves is neither interesting nor particularly convincing.<br/><br/>I'm using skill challenges as an example because it's something Alexander talks about a great deal.  But maybe something simpler would be clearer.  Let's take Vincent's classic rightward-pointing example of "If you have the high ground you get a +2 to hit."  Now let's say the rule was "+20 to hit" instead.  In most systems, that would go from a nice advantage to a completely absurd advantage and everyone would spend all their time standing on hilltops.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335199/#Comment_335199" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T09:41:43+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  9:41AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>Or maybe that's not dissociation.

I'm getting this, see?<br/>As far as I can see, you're not getting this at all.  You're trying to use "dissociated" as a general pejorative for "I don't like it" or "shittiness" like Deliverator is proposing.  In particular, you're conflating:<br/><br/>1) The mechanic by itself does not stand for any specific effect in the game-world.<br/>2) The mechanic clearly implies a result in the game-world, but it is a result that I don't like. <br/><br/>For example, this is the difference between being able to use "Trick Shot" once a day and being able to use Fireball once a day.  The Fireball spell has a stated game world reason that the caster forgets it.  As the book says, "Once cast, a spell is totally forgotten.  Gone.  The mystical symbols impressed upon the brain carry power, and speaking the spell discharges this power, draining all memory of the spell used."  You might not like that explanation, but it represents the fictional world inspired by Jack Vance's books.  That casting is intended to be what happens in the game world.  A wizard character understands that the magic discharge wipes his memory, and could talk about that.  However, it is unclear how if at all an archer would talk about using his Trick Shot.  <br/><br/>There could certainly be a grey area, say like an explanation that was so thin that some would argue that it is just a token explanation and not really something that is intended to be a part of the fictional world.  The distinction still exists, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335201/#Comment_335201" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T09:53:04+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  9:53AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, exactly John.

And even if we switch to talking about per-encounter powers, there's no guarantee that an enemy will do that, because there's no guarantee that the player will choose to use an encounter power. And if the player fails to land the encounter power, doesn't that call the opportunity into question? "Dang, I thought I could get him, but I couldn't."<br/><br/>And the five minute rest thing is definitely not about dailies, it's about per-encounter powers.<br/><br/>How does an at-will not do the same thing?  "I had an opportunity in this six-second span of time to do some damage to the guy, but I was/wasn't able to do it."<br/><br/>I can even be a fucking asshole about it too.  "Hey, how come I can never have more than one significant opportunity in a six second span of time to do damage to someone, huh?! That's fucking weird."

When I'm in play and I pick an encounter power,  that moment of "WTF" doesn't even register as anything more than a mild speed bump.

Its an intersection between individual familiarity with mechanics with game situation thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo translate my argument in those older discussions to this one...Any person can take even the mechanic they find most disassociative and with sufficient practice become familiar enough with it to incorporate it into their play in a manner that is no longer disassociative.  The only issue is how much effort the person willing to do to accomplish that feat and how much less-fun play are they willing to suffer through to get to the point where its no longer less-fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335546/#Comment_335546" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T13:58:29+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  1:58PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2011 2:06PM by Michael Pfaff.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're conflating "abstraction" with "dissociation".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335588/#Comment_335588" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T20:25:45+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  8:25PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I think this whole thing boils down to personal feelings...this mechanic makes me feel dissassociated that mechanic doesn't.

However, that isn't how Justin Alexander used the term and that isn't what I had in mind as the topic of the thread.  He specifically talks about the benefits of dissociation and how dissociation can power and focus a game on the story.   <br><br>I realize that dissociated is a problematic term for this reason, but I'd prefer to stay focused on the clouds &amp; dice part of this, rather than talking about a purely subjective feeling of not liking certain games.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335633/#Comment_335633" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T06:52:29+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  6:52AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But John, that's exactly my point.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe talks about the benefits of dissociated mechanics...there aren't any such thing.  There are no mechanics that any person can point to and say "this is a dissociated mechanic"...because ALL definitions of such are founded on personal feeling.

Instead, fiction is applied after-the-fact in order to justify the mechanic. <br><br>Trick Strike is disassociated because there's not a fictional action I can take to limit the Rogue's Trick Strike ("I pay special attention to his feints and lures so I don't fall for his trick strike!" or "I tie him up so he's not able to feint and lure me." No. It just happens no matter what what the fictional circumstances.). It's a mechanic first, fiction later. The proposed fictional pre-requisites of Trick Strike ("My opponent makes an awful mistake that only happens every so often!") is completed trumped by the mechanic. It doesn't matter if I'm a 1st level Rogue facing off against a 30 Level Warrior of Mars. I still get my Trick Strike (assuming I fulfill the requirements to make an attack). <br><br>In other words, the mechanic is completely detached from what's actually happening in the fiction. Instead, we simply handwave an explanation. <br><br>"Ah. I'm gassy. Only once in a while I feel well enough to do my trick strike." <br><br>Whatever. It doesn't matter. The mechanic isn't rooted in fiction. It's rooted in: 4E PHB pg. 15, "Daily powers are so dramatic and powerful that you can use each one only once a day." <br/><br/>It's purely a game balance thing. <br/><br/>It's the same with Aspects and Fate Points. Wait, my guy is "The Baddest Motherfucker", but I'm not really, because I don't have my Fate Point to spend on this situation or whatever. <br/><br/>Dissociative is not bad or good. It's just a different style of mechanic. <br/><br/>But, claiming that it's not a thing, that's weird. <br/><br/>I'm imagining a "Daily" power that triggers from fictional cues instead of mechanical cues. Ah! I got it: <br/><br/>When your enemy makes a deadly mistake, you can use Trick Strike on him. You've got him right where you want him. <br/><br/>So, we're relying on the fiction (the enemy making a deadly mistake) to inform the mechanic (Trick Strike), instead of letting the mechanic take precedence over the fiction (Trick Strike - Oh, I feinted, Oh, he made a mistake, Oh, I felt happy... or, whatever "fluff" you want to apply to the board game maneuver). <br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Maybe, you see it as not dissociated because it informs the fiction still by prompting some sort of "story" to be applied at some level. <br/><br/>But, I don't think that's what JA means by dissociated. <br/><br/>So, what I think is happening is we're arguing based on our own <i>definitions</i> of dissociated, but not our "feelings" about dissociated.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335643/#Comment_335643" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T08:07:07+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  8:07AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2011 8:07AM by JDCorley.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Michael Pfaff</cite>Trick Strike is disassociated because there's not a fictional action I can take to limit the Rogue's Trick Strike ("I pay special attention to his feints and lures so I don't fall for his trick strike!" or "I tie him up so he's not able to feint and lure me."

If I recall you cannot perform a Trick Shot unarmed against a foe in Kansas when you are in slow orbit around the planet Saturn. So, conditionally associated with spacial positioning and equipment, statistically associated with foes defenses and actions, and not directly associated a foe's success or failure on an action. <br/><br/>Although, from that approach you'll find that mechanics are always partially associated and partially disassociated with the fiction. Chess moves for example are associated with position, but not the romantic entanglements. <br/><br/>You can then talk about elements of fiction which are disassociated from all mechanics - like the aforementioned romantic entanglements between chess pieces. And from this we can conclude that chess is disassociated from the story of the bishop and the rook's furtive love affair - even if the moves on the board are essential for telling that story.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335646/#Comment_335646" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T08:33:57+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  8:33AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No. <br/><br/>Armor Class is directly extrapolated from the fiction. <br/><br/>I am wearing leather armor, therefore my AC is 5.

This might be a drift, it might not; I'll take a stab at this:<br/><br/>Abstract mechanic:  The mechanic is not dependent on the SIS; that is, there's no arrow from the cloud into the dice.<br/><br/>Concrete mechanic:  The mechanic is dependent on the SIS; that is, there is an arrow from the cloud into the dice.<br/><br/><br/>So, some examples:<br/><br/>"A Magic-User has d4 hit points per level."  This is Abstract.  Note that "Magic-User" is something that resides in the dice; it has a specific mechanical meaning and isn't informed by the Cloud -- it's not like any old being who happens to use magic is subject to this.<br/><br/>"If a character mentions they're on a mission from King Osric, they gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy rolls with the guards."  This is Concrete.  There isn't anything sitting there on the character sheet or in the other mechanical physical tools that tells you what the character has mentioned; that arrow comes straight out of the Cloud of the SIS.<br/><br/>"When a character has the high ground, he gains a +2 to hit."  This is one of the trickier ones.  In effect, we don't know enough about the game to say whether this is Concrete or Abstract.  If there's miniatures and maps and those are used to determine high ground, then this is Abstract; the rule in that case is equivalent to "If a character miniature is on a square with a higher elevation than the square his target occupies, he gains a +2 to hit."  That makes it clearer that no cloud is involved.<br/>  On the other hand, if the relative positioning of the characters exists in the SIS, then it is Concrete.  If there's no physical prop to reference, then the information has to come out of the cloud.<br/><br/>Take especial note that it makes absolutely no difference what's going on with the arrows leading out from the mechanic; there's no difference to Abstractness and Concreteness between "If a character loses half his hit points or more from a single blow, his actions are at -2 for 1d4 rounds" and "If a character loses half his hit points or more from a single blow, he is very sad."  The output is irrelevant to this particular thing.<br/><br/>(In this last point, I think perhaps I differ from what Vincent was cited as suggesting, as that example is more wrapped around the outputs.  Indeed, it doesn't even have any arrows leading out of the cloud.  I believe that's less problematic than it might first seem.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure if everyone's sold on that, but I would suggest it is strictly objective.  It is not related to personal preferences of any sort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335651/#Comment_335651" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T09:17:26+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  9:17AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Michael's example of armour class and leather armour!  This is an excellent example; I shamefully want to follow up my own post with an examination of it.<br/><br/>So, as per his example, let's say a character is wearing leather armour and therefore his AC is 5.  Is that Abstract or Concrete?  Is the arrow coming out of the dice or out of a cloud?<br/><br/>Time for a quick tangent on distinguishing the cloud from the dice:<br/><br/>The dice:  The distinguishing characteristic of the dice is that their information is open to objective inspection.  There's no real argument possible around the dice; the facts speak for themselves.  "I rolled a 4."  "You do not have line of sight to the goblin."  "My character sheet says: Armour Worn: Leather."<br/><br/>The cloud:  The distinguishing characteristic of the cloud is that its information is established by consensus.  All sorts of arguments and discussions are possible.  "You said the water was only knee-deep!  Yes, I meant knee-deep for a human -- you're a hobbit!"  "I want to take the high ground.  It's a flat featureless plain; there's no high ground to be had."  "Can I sneak up on the guy and backstab him?  In his back?  With the stabbing?"<br/><br/><br/>So, back to our example:<br/><br/>Consider a mechanic:  "If a character is wearing leather armour, his AC is 5."<br/><br/>In my opinion, in the average baseline D&amp;D game that we all know and love, this is mostly Abstract.  It is essentially equivalent to:<br/><br/>"If, on your character sheet, the armour listed as 'Armour Worn:' is 'Leather', then his AC is 5."<br/><br/>Now, one might argue, well yeah okay, I've still got Leather listed as my Armour Worn, but I'm at the king's wedding so of course I'm not wearing it, duh.  That's simply a failure to keep the dice updated as implied or required; it still is primarily divorced from the cloud.<br/><br/><br/>We can consider a similar mechanic:<br/><br/>"If a character has a particularly gruesome appearance, his AC improves by 1."  This is certainly looking more Concrete, more dependent on the cloud, but we need to be cautious.  If this is GURPS and a character sheet has 'Particularly Gruesome Appearance: 5 points' on it, then we're still firmly in the Abstract.<br/><br/><br/>And we might also encounter something like:<br/><br/>"The firbolg is wearing a set of +1 leather armour.  It would be enormous on a human; only the largest of humans and half-orcs could wear it effectively."  We're now considerably closer to the cloud.  Is my guy big enough to wear this armor?  Some of that decision might be informed by the character sheet, but some groups would rely more firmly on what has been established in the SIS.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway I may have beaten this dead horse as far as it will go; hopefully that's been enlightening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335652/#Comment_335652" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T09:17:42+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  9:17AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael,<br/><br/>So, Trick Shot has a state - used or available (just look at the little check box on the character sheet). Under certain conditions, you use it or take an extended rest, it changes state. And it suffers restrictions based on that state. Certainly using Trick Shot or taking an extended rest is part of fiction (if you disagree then we might need to step out of this thread and discuss the difference between narrative and fiction in play). The state of Trick Shot also determines whether it can be used, that is a mechanical restriction caused by fiction, but disassociated with other aspects of the fiction such as how you describe an action you would like to take. <br/><br/>So I would disagree with your claim that the "daily" aspect of the Rogue's Trick Strike is completely disassociated with the fiction. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335653/#Comment_335653" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T09:35:10+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  9:35AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Michael Pfaff</cite>Armor Class is directly extrapolated from the fiction.<br/><br/>I am wearing leather armor, therefore my AC is 5.

Awesome. Clearly, the part where you need a weapon, and standing within range of your enemy, etc. So, I never said, "Trick Strike is completely dissociated" in the sense that it's removed from the fiction in all aspects of it. Obviously, the [W] mechanic is rooted in fiction. I need to know what weapon I'm using in order to extrapolate the damage die. <br/><br/>I don't even mind Trick Strike's abstract nature of a series of feints and strikes that maneuvers an enemy. Makes perfect sense to me. I do X in the fiction, Y happens mechanically as a result. <br/><br/>However, suddenly, there is a that "state" of unused or used that completely avoids the fiction. It's completely mechanics-based, designed to give the system "dramatic" powers. <br/><br/>I'm fine with that. But, it's dissociated from anything else going on in the fiction. So, we have to come up with some sort of justification of why that is <i>in the fiction</i> in order for it to make sense. <br/><br/>The result is, the onus is on us to determine what the mechanic means, and that makes it entirely arbitrary in coming up with fictional effects based on the mechanic. <br/><br/>Unlike, say, Armor Class, which is abstract, but because it's rooted in the fiction (as a generalized sum of what armor you're wearing), we know how to apply the fiction to the mechanics and vice versa. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And that is exactly what Trick Strike is too, you see an opportunity, you try to do something with it. It is exactly as dissociated as a normal attack in D&amp;D3.</blockquote>\nI guess we can agree to disagree. I still think you're conflating abstractness and scale versus dissociation to the fiction. <br/><br/>It's like this: <br/><br/>Once a month summarize your stance and roll a Speech check to see if your arguments throughout the month sway Republicans to avoid economic catastrophe. If your stance includes an awesome point, you get +5 to your check! <br/><br/>Large scale abstraction, the +5 entirely rooted in fiction, it doesn't trigger unless something occurs in the fiction. <br/><br/>Versus this: <br/>Each time you put forth a point during conversation in the debate with Republicans, make a Speech check. Once per conversation, <i>you are awesome - you get a +5 to any check you make</i>! <br/><br/>Small scale, focused mechanic, the +5 entirely dissociated - completely irrelevant to the fiction (outside of having a conversation), but after the fact I can totally justify it in whatever way I want. "My breath was fresh that time." "I talked about how we might slip further into recession." "I just wore my $5000 suit." Whatever. <br/><br/>The level of abstraction is entirely irrelevant to the dissociated argument.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335661/#Comment_335661" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T10:55:25+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 10:55AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adding on to what Michael says here -  a simple test to distinguish is whether you can work from the <i>fiction</i> to the <i>mechanics</i>.  <br/><br/>i.e. I describe to you in detail the established state of the fiction at that moment, but using <b>only</b> real-world terms and <i>no game-mechanical terms</i>.  So I might say how far away someone is in some real-world unit not used by the game, but not in game hexes or squares.  I might describe established features of the implement being used, but not it's official designation in the game.  <br/><br/>In the case of an everyday attack in D&amp;D, someone could describe the present layout in non-game terms (i.e. the orc is two arm-lengths from me, I have a sharpened length of metal in my hand), and I could say whether they could use the everyday attack mechanic.

Say in the fiction I'm walking cautiously down a long dark hallway...I step on a creaky board...creeeeaaaak...oh shit I hope it didn't hear that!<br/>\nPulling a block from a Jenga tower is a perfect ASSOCIATED mechanic for that.  Carefully pulling a block from the tower...Oh Shit!...when the tower starts to lean...I hope it doesn't come crashing down.  It works, and its completely in tune with the fiction...for me, at that particular moment.  Because in that particular moment in that particular game what's important about the "fiction" is the mood, the tension, the inevitable surprise.  Show me a mechanic that captures tension and inevitable surprise better than a Jenga tower.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in another time, in another mood, in a different situation like one where I'm in an epic duel what's important to me in the fiction THEN is the back and forth flurry of maneuvers as each fighter seeks position for the killer blow.  Pulling a block for a Jenga tower in this situation ain't gonna cut it, I'm gonna want something more like Riddle of Steel...which itself doesn't handle "oh shit the floor just creaked" events in a particularly associative way.  BUT...with a few tweaks...like having the Jenga game be just the duel and not the entire scenario and each back and forth flurry be the jockeying for position, and whoever makes the tower fall...that's the guy who left himself open first...well now, that fits the bill rather nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint:  No such thing as a disociative mechanic.  Only each individual persons personal impression about whether a particular mechanic at a particular moment of play did or didn't trigger a level of awareness about the overall mental phenomenon being described in this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttempts to put an objective measure to it...such as arrows to clouds or derivations from fiction...not buying it.  That just happens to be a pattern that you recognize of particular mechanics and particular situations that tend to trigger a particular level of awareness -- for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as mentioned above, the pattern of mechanics and situations that do tend to trigger that awareness for you depends HIGHLY on what you as a player have and haven't become familiar with in your actual play.  Things that used to be triggers can cease to be and things that you used to do routinely can now snap your suspenders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335677/#Comment_335677" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T12:04:07+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 12:04PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2011 12:04PM by jhkim.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Point:  No such thing as a disociative mechanic.

This is pissing me off.  You keep insisting on projecting <i>your</i> definition of dissociation onto what I'm talking about, and ignoring what I'm saying.  I am <b>not</b> claiming that in-character mechanics trigger a particular level of awareness.  I am not making any claim about the feeling of immersion or the awareness.  <br><br>There are two completely different things here: <br>1) The subjective feeling of connectedness to the game and fiction.  <br>2) The objective distinction of how different mechanics relate to the fiction.  <br><br>You're conflating the two.  By saying "different people feel differently about certain mechanics" - you're then concluding "Well, then there can't be anything objectively different about these mechanics - it's all just people'e feelings."  That's simply not right.  Some people like strawberry and don't like vanilla, and some people don't like vanilla and like strawberry.  However, that doesn't mean there isn't an objective difference between the two flavors.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335678/#Comment_335678" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T12:06:05+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 12:06PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Pulling a block from a Jenga tower is a perfect ASSOCIATED mechanic for that.

OK, I posit that there's a man with a sword standing next to a goblin. I will leave the mechanics up to you -- you can decide what level he is and so on. What information will you give me, in real world terms, that will tell me how likely he is to successfully attack that goblin? Since we're not using mechanics to convey information, I reserve the right to decide which edition of D&amp;D we're using post-facto.<br/>There's two things going on here: <br/><br/>1) Exactly quantifying can be tricky.  That is, I could describe someone as a skilled fighter, and talk some about his ability.  I've regularly done this in game systems, when players talk to NPCs.  i.e. The corrupt guard talks to my character about what the dark champion is like, and I can estimate what level the dark champion is.  It is not exact, and perhaps that indicates a sliding scale of how in-character a mechanic is.  However, there is still a real distinction between this and out-of-character mechanics like how many Fate Points the dark champion has.  <br/><br/>2) You can reserve that right to change game system, but I don't think it shows what you're trying to prove.  Changing out the game system can potentially change what the fictional results will be from a given action.  i.e. In one system, he's got a 60% chance to hit and in another he has only a 30%.  This is, in fact, <i>proof</i> of the in-character nature of the mechanics, not the other way around.  If I was reading a detailed non-mechanical description of fictional events, I could quite possibly tell what edition was being used.  That's part of the in-character nature, that there are specific fictional consequences of the mechanics used.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>In the case of an everyday attack in D&amp;D, someone could describe the present layout in non-game terms (i.e. the orc is two arm-lengths from me, I have a sharpened length of metal in my hand), and I could say whether they could use the everyday attack mechanic.  However, the same is not true of Trick Shot.  There is nothing in the present fictional world that corresponds to the used/unused check beside the Daily power (and by the way, according to Justin Alexander's quote, Trick Shot is a Daily power, not a per-encounter power).</blockquote>\nArgh, sure there is.

So the orcs really act this way - presenting opportunities every round exactly up until the point that the PC uses Trick Shot, and then act differently during the rest of that day?  If there are two archers in the party, then one might be able to see by how the orcs behave whether the other has used Trick Shot yet?  <br/><br/>I'm picturing a bit of dialogue: <br/>"Welcome back, Tarquel!  Glad to have you join us this fight.  How was your scouting mission?"<br/>"Nothing much to report." <br/>"Hold on.

The orcs may never present the opportunity until the round in which Trick Shot is attempted, and never present it again afterwards. Or maybe the opportunity wasn't really there, the character just thought it was (i.e. you rolled like shit on your power and couldn't land the shot).  Or maybe they always have this terrible hole in their defenses but the character isn't good enough to spot it all the time. All these possibilities are bound up in the abstraction of the orcs defending themselves as best they can, the character trying to perceive opportunities as best they can, and so on.  But it doesn't change how associated the action is with the fiction. The orcs is just fightin' and the archer is just shootin'.  He sees his chance and he takes it. Just like any other attack in the entire game.<br/><br/>Edit: Like, if I'm fighting an orc, and I roll 5 consecutive attack rolls, and I only score a hit on the 5th, is it right to say "the orcs never presented an opportunity for me to hit them until then? Could someone in the world observe their fighting and see that?"  No, maybe they did and I missed it, or maybe I was not very good at taking advantage of opportunities on previous rounds, or maybe they didn't do anything different but I redoubled my efforts, or maybe yes, they did let down their guard after I ineffectually fought them for a while. But there's no requirement that it be any of these things. The abstraction level is chunkier than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335687/#Comment_335687" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T13:01:25+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  1:01PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John defined your way the definition is irrelevant.  In order to have relevance a distinction needs to allow you to take that information and do something with it.  Just like the distinction between strawberry and vanilla is irrelevant.  Consider, a person has equal like of strawberry and vanilla and is not in a particularly strong feeling mood  either way.  You offer them ice cream..."do you want strawberry or vanilla?"...what are the odds that they answer with some variation of "whatever"  Because it doesn't really matter.  It ONLY matters when the person you ask actually has a preference -- whether fleeting..."Today I feel like strawberry, thanks" or long term "strawberry, blech"<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's take this phenonomen being discussed.  Lets say for the sake of argument that you and Michael put forth a good working definition that allows us to go around and catalog mechanics as being Type A or Type D.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what.  Other than having a catalog full of yet another label, what are you going to do with that information?<br/>\n<br/>\nExplain to me how you're going to use that information either in play or in game design to accomplish something that doesn't ultimately come back to personal experience, preference, and feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what you won't be able to do reliably:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won't be able to say:  "I want to design a game for people who like associated mechanics so I'm going to consult my catalog and build a game only out of associated mechanics".  You won't be able to do that successfully because I guarentee a non insignificant number of people are going to find some part of your game to FEEL disasociated to them....whether you think it should be or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won't be able to say:  "Oh the problem you're having with that game is that you're approaching the mechanic as if its disociative when really is associative so you need to approach it this other way instead".  You won't be able to say that because whether that diagnosis is accurate or not will completely depend on the FEELINGS of the person you're attempting to coach.  They may already have hit on the associated nature of the mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA distinction without application is just naval gazing.  And this distinction has no application that doesn't quickly devolve to Green vs. Purple that I can see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Here's a rule:<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce per game of Dread, you can make someone else pull a Jenga block instead of you. If the tower falls, their character dies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssociated?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nMaybe.  And that's exactly my point.  Depends on who you ask, when you ask it, and the surrounding context of that instance of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you come up with a very specific example where the answer is very likely to be universally agreed upon for everyone you ask?  Sure.  The phenomenon is a real thing and it can be identified on a case by case basis.  But you can't extrapolate from that example any kind of rubric by which you then categorize games as using predominantly one or predominantly the other because once you get out of the rarified air of academic examples and into the real world a whole lot of shit comes down to "that depends".<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike so many of these discussions there's tons of other concepts that criss cross back and forth and tie back in.  This one has a significant tie to the idea of the shared imaginary* space and its role in play.  I happen to believe that the SIS is a critically important concept but also just the tip of the fiction iceberg.  The vast majority of all role playing experience is NEVER EVER SHARED with the other people at the table...it happens entirely inside your own brain.  Take a simple example of two characters chasing a third down a modern city street.  Here's an exercise.  start a thread, go ahead and just start it in your own imagination if you like.  In your best GM voice describe the action...don't go crazy and fall into the trap of a change in medium, describe it exactly as you'd describe it in the heat of the moment in the midst of a high tension scene of actual play.  Now ask each of your "players" to picture that scene in their heads as you've described (this is what everyone normally does in an RPG...right?) only instead of leaving that scene only in their heads have them take some time to describe the scene in your thread (or the thread in your brain with the other players being other voices of you if you like that kind of mental exercise).  Have the players describe it in depth, as if they were coloring in all of the details to a blind friend who couldn't see it for themselves and wanted to know everything about it.  This works best if each of them do it in secret (use whisper in an actual thread).  Then compare the descriptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose descriptions are as close as we're likely to come to "seeing" what they "see" in their imagination short of being able to film their brainwaves.  I guarantee no two of them will be alike and they will vary greatly from your abbreviated "just enough to make play happen" GM's description.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd THAT'S the crucial thing.  THAT'S what makes this whole associated disociated thing bollux.  The Shared Imaginary Space is "just enough to make play happen" but the majority of the detail exists only in my brain, and its way different...WAY different from the detail that exists in your brain...even if we're in complete agreement on the big points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the HUGE weakness of the arrows and clouds stuff or the "lead with the fiction" stuff or the "associated with what's going on in the fiction stuff".  Who's fiction?  Your fiction?  My fiction?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou and I could both be players in the same game at the same time strapped into some magic machine that records our imagination into a movie.  Your movie and my movie would be as different as two different film school classes given the same summary draft of a script and told to go make a film.  Therefor that exact same moment in play that to YOU felt disociative because it had no direct tie in to the fiction...to your fiction...to the movie in your brain...to me was perfectly fine.  Because it absolutely tied directly into the fiction in my brain.  Perhaps because my brain already included details that your brain didn't that hadn't been important enough to share until now but which made that mechanic make complete sense to me...when I explain it to you you might think that I just retrofitted something in after the fact, but in my brain it was there all along.  Another explanation is that perhaps I've just gotten so good to retrofitting new details into the movie in my brain that my brain no longer distinguishes between what was there already before the mechanic was used and what got added after the fact to justify using the mechanic.  At the point where that becomes "all the same to me" the whole associated vs. disociated thing falls apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way you and I have very different experiences of what just happened.  You might find the event disociative...I might well not.  Who's right.  By your definition we both are...the difference is you will NEVER be able to associate a mechanic to the fiction that is in MY brain.  And thing is, the fiction that we do share (the SIS) will NEVER be more than a fraction of the total fiction present at that table.  In a game with 5 players, there are 5 parallel universes being created simultaneously and the SIS merely provides a sketch of commonality to hang play from.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo each and every time you ask a question like that the answer will be "that depends".  It will depend on how the fiction in my brain differs from the fiction in yours...and how aware we are of how the fiction in our respective brains got that way...and how we FEEL about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*I will never change to Shared ImaginED Space, so if that bothers someone, get over it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335693/#Comment_335693" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T13:30:09+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  1:30PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Arg.

(My first exposure to the term back on rec.games.frp.advocacy focused heavily on immersing yourself in a character / heavy identification with a specific character. Modern usage seems to include "I really liked that", "I had an emotional reaction", "I was really in a creative groove", and a host of other things.)<br><br>So I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "fictionally immersive". (A googling shows the term being sparsely and contradictorally used.) But if you mean that the mechanics are very effective at provoking an emotional response which is deeply equated to the emotional atmosphere of the fictional scenario, then I would agree 100%. I've played it twice, and:<br/><br/>(1) The emotional resonance between the suspense of drawing the Jenga block and the suspense of the game fiction is incredibly effective at provoking real emotional responses.<br/><br/>(2) The stakes of the fictional narrative effectively jack up the suspense of the block pull, which creates a positive feedback loop the enhances the whole thing.<br/><br/>My controversial assignation of Dread as an STG (and it's a little controversial even in my own head) shouldn't be taken as a critique of the game. It's a very effective game.<br/><br/>Why do I think Dread's mechanics are dissociated? Well, as you say: "The risk of the jenga tower falling grows as more blocks are pulled and literally becomes a physical manifestation of the growing danger and dread in the game world." But what you're describing there is not a property of the game world. It's a property of the narrative. I guess if you squint at it right you can say, "Everything gets tougher as the game goes along because people get scared and they start making mistakes." But, speaking frankly, that's not what the game is trying to model. Things are getting tougher because the game wants to create a narrative structure of rising tension.<br/><br/>The real give-away, for me, is when you look at the decisions the players are making: When you make a decision to pull a block or not pull a block, are you making a decision that resembles a decision being made by your character? Not really. You're making that decision based on a combination of (a) how important success is to you and (b) the risk of failure (i.e., the collapse of the tower). While (a) clearly maps to your character, the risk of the tower does not clearly map to the actual circumstances of the game world. It instead maps to the current condition of the narrative. (It might coincidentally do so and it would be relatively trivial to find examples where it did. But it's a coincidence, not an associated mechanic.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Michael Pfaff</cite>"Associated" mechanics are a chimera that doesn't exist except in the eye of the beholder, as ephemeral as any other technical preference. It's a "I know what it is when I see it" term that will never be useful except as a rhetorical cudgel against games I don't like.</blockquote>\nThat's unfortunate, because the term doesn't actually have any judgment to it. What you're saying is like saying "dice" is a term that will never be useful except as a rhetorical cudgel against games I don't like. I guess if you don't like dice that's true, but the idea of authoritatively declaring all games that use dice as being inferior seems like a weird one to me. Ditto dissociated mechanics. (Or associated mechanics.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I also dissociate from D&amp;D of all sorts because I can't make any sense of expanding HP and character classes, and I dissociate from all WW games because they use dicky terminology and it plunges me into a cold bath of disbelief. I'm getting this, see?</blockquote>\nI think the key mistake here is thinking of a mechanic as dissociating from you. The dissociation I'm talking about is a dissociation between mechanic and game world. Your emotional response or taste doesn't really come into it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>However, it is unclear how if at all an archer would talk about using his Trick Shot.</blockquote>\n"Every so often I see an opportunity to make this fucking awesome shot. It doesn't happen a lot, but I'm good enough that when the opportunity does happen, I can make a shot that's so great."<br/><br/>Which is an excellent example of dissociation.<br/><br/>I don't think that the entirety of dissociated mechanics can be summed up as a dissociation between player decisions and character decisions, but it's certainly the easiest to define.<br/><br/>Associated: Player makes a decision to cast 3.5 <i>fireball</i>. The mechanics of this spell (like all mechanics) are abstracted, but the player is making a decision to cast a spell based on the number of times it can be cast in a day, the amount of damage it does (which increases based on the perspicacity of the spellcaster), the amount of space being targeted, the target's weakness against fire, etc. etc. etc. And all of these decisions (although mechanical in nature) are directly associated to the character's decision: The character knows he has a limited number of spells per day, he knows the spell does more damage based on the spellcaster's ability, he knows how much space the spell will consume, he knows that the white dragon is vulnerable to flames, etc. etc. etc.<br/><br/>Dissociated: Player makes a decision to use 4E Trick Strike. The mechanics of this ability (like all mechanics) are abstracted, but the player is making a decision to use the ability based on the knowledge that he can only use it once per day (purely mechanical with no relationship to the character's decision) or he's choosing to use narrative authority to dictate that such a shot has appeared at just this moment and can be taken (a narrative control with no relationship to the character's decision). The character obviously isn't choosing to exercise narrative control. Nor is the character choosing whether or not to take the shot based on his knowledge that he will not be able to make such a shot again today (that's not knowledge he possesses).<br/><br/>It's like a football receiver: It may be true that they're unlikely to make a really amazing catch more than once per game. But never once will you hear them say, "Well, I decided not to make that catch because I figured I might need an Amazing Catch in the 4th Quarter." Nor will you hear them say, "I really wish I could have caught that touchdown in the 4th Quarter, but I'd already used up my Amazing Catch for the day on that play in the first half."<br/><br/>What I find infinitely more interesting than the properties of dissociated mechanics, however, is the fact that associated mechanics effectively FORCE you to make decisions as if you were your character: You cannot choose to cast <i>fireball</i> in OD&amp;D without making that decision as if you were your character. The act of using the mechanic is the act of roleplaying (i.e., making decisions as if you were your character).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryant</cite>The fiction doesn't have independent existence, though. The players, through some mechanism undefined here, decide if the awesomeness occurred. Now, in the traditional kind of game Justin prefers, it's the GM deciding. Possibly the real meat of his argument is that player narrative control breaks his immersion.</blockquote>\nIt would be more accurate to say that when a player uses a narrative control mechanic (or any other dissociated mechanic) they aren't roleplaying. By definition.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryant</cite>I would sincerely suggest not starting with Justin Alexander's essay, then. What he says is this: "The disadvantage of a dissociated mechanic, as we've established, is that it disengages the player from the role they're playing." He doesn't condemn dissociated mechanics out of hand, but he does say very clearly that they are incompatible with roleplaying. If he made that one extra step and realized that the 4e power system has strong narrativist tendencies, it'd be a much better essay. </blockquote>\nIt's not that I didn't make that step. It's that I don't agree with that step. I actually find the <i>post hoc</i> claim that, for example, Trick Strike was designed as a narrative control mechanic in which the player decides that an NPC will make a mistake to be kind of silly. Not only does nothing in the rulebook suggest that to be true, but the rulebook actually says the exact opposite.<br/><br/>The comforting delusion that 4E was designed with player narrative control in mind can be quickly deflated by simply looking at the original skill challenge mechanics: With a few tweaks, the basic skill challenge infrastructure could be used to create a really flexible narrative control tool for empowering players. But what they actually published in the DMG was a railroad-fest that actually <i>limits</i> the narrative input that players usually enjoy in a traditional RPG.<br/><br/>I think if 4E actually <i>had</i> embraced narrative control mechanics, it would be a much better game.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14606/clouds-dice-and-disocciation/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14606/clouds-dice-and-disocciation">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14606/clouds-dice-and-disocciation/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14606/clouds-dice-and-disocciation/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14606%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14606%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
