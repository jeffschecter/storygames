Im surprised I didnt find any previous attempt around the net. One thing that got me excited to try it was this critique I saw in another forum, from the user FrankTrollman:\n<blockquote>The primary thing that got missed [In Eclipse Phase] is that people still have \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201clanguage\u201d skills and such. That's throwback thinking. Consider: you walk into a new region that is completely cut off from the outside worlds. Maybe your new region is a slowship to Pluto or is an isolated chamber that a fringe group is using to store their apocalyptic plot. Whatever. The point is, that you personally carry IMDB, all of Wikipedia, the Library of Congress, TV Tropes, PubMed, IUPAC, and a realtime translation service to every known language in the solar system with you. Even without the ability to harvest any meaningful data from the region around you, you still just ambiently have more information at your fingertips than you could actually think about in a thousand years. People shouldn't be \u201cknowing\u201d facts, they should be \u201cfinding\u201d and \u201ccontextualizing\u201d facts. The very way these people interact with the idea of knowledge is completely alien to modern human thought \u2013 and it's really exciting. But the skills just don't match up with that reality. The sample characters \u201cknow\u201d things like Academics: Economics and Laguage: Mandarin, and that's just completely fucking irrelevant to people who carry the entire internet in an effectively instantaneously searchable format in their belt buckle or even their actual bones.</blockquote>\nThis just screams the "Open your Mind" move for me, only instead of the Maelstron, its opening to the Mesh (or perhaps more accurately, to your Muse).<br/><br/>So, what do you think, Guys ?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434354/#Comment_434354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T09:26:07+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  9:26AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2014 9:43AM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally go for it!

Feel free to contribute any way you think appropriate!<br/><br/>So far we get 3 options for the concept of player identity. Notice how they follow a natural scale of Fidelity X Usefulness, where the first one seems the most accurate depiction of the original material (but also the more complex), while the last one is the most simple and gameable implementation, and the middle one strikes a balance between them:<br/><br/><b>1.</b> Ego and Morph as separated playbooks, where Ego is permanent (AKA the char true Identity) and Morph can change at will. Ego could be based on occupational archetypes ( The Ego Hunter, The Scavenger, The Escort, The Smuggler, etc) or on ideology (The Extropian, The Barsoomian, The Argonaut, etc). Both Egos and Morphs playbooks would present a set of moves for players to take, but these should be kept to a minimum (5 for Egos and 3 for Morphs ?) for keeping things simple, otherwise you risk too much rules-bloat/tracking. <br/><br/><b>2.</b> Ego and Morph subsumed into single-concept/identity playbooks (the Rhyzome, the Bodybuilder, the Ghost, etc [look <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?729369-Apocalypse-World-Eclipse-Phase-hack&amp;p=18032237#post18032237" rel="nofollow">here</a>] ). Morphs would work as gear, having minor or major importance depending on how central they are to the concept. Ie: if its not important for a given Idendity, list it as plain gear functioning through Tags (+Genefix, +Vac support, etc). If its important make it like the Driver\xb4s Car or Hardholder\xb4s Hold full of different aspects and upgradeable options.<br/><br/><b>3.</b> Morph-based, where playbooks represent different Morphs that you can change at will, while Ego are players own "memories and experience" and dont have a mechanical counterpart.<br/><br/><br/>Other than that, we get three important concepts to implement: <br/><br/>1) Ideologies; <br/>2) Rep and Social Networks; <br/>3) Instant acessing your Muse for finding and contextualizing any information in the universe on the spot (which I think fits nicely as an adaptation of the "Open you Mind" move)<br/><br/>Thoughts ?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434356/#Comment_434356" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T09:45:41+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  9:45AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, replace Rep and Social Networks into the strings mechanics.

Have you thought about making Ego the core stat distribution and then making Morphs each have their own playbook? It'd be like when a PC swaps playbooks in AW, but instead of an advance it's just something you <i>do</i>. So like Morphs have a list of Moves, but you've always got the same Stat array. Some Egos are just better suited to certain Morphs this way.<br/><br/>Maybe a combat Morph is all "When you engage in bloody up-close fighting, take +1 to the roll."

I thought about adding "ideology" as options that could give aditional advantages, but I dont know how to that. Or perhaps having the different Reps attached to Ego would be enough already.  <br/><br/>Fenarisk, thanks for sharing. It seems separating Ego and Morph is an obvious move. I liked your Call a Favor move.

Being a players-driving, radical sandboxer kind of player though, I always visualized my EP games more as "transhuman freelancers doing whatever they want for profit, rep and fun" than CoC-like "investigators trying to unravel the GMs plot of the week". <br/><br/>I wouldnt mind the eventual Firewall/Ozma/whatever mission job here and there (not too different from the Turncoat playbook built-in spying in my mind), but the game focus would firmly be AW-like for me, with players organizing into Titanian salvage and rescue crews one night and Extropian nightclub enforcers in the other, while building enough Rep for finishing their private habitat on a Saturn moon with their own fringe society model and launching their own anti-Jovian galactic memetic campaign. Or whatever. <br/><br/>And this screams AW for me. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434546/#Comment_434546" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T10:07:23+00:00" title="June 29, 2014 10:07AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it works for you, go for it.

But apples and oranges, man. <br/><br/>*edit*<br/><br/>One thing that could be interesting in a more Firewall / Ozma focused game would be pitching the group inteests against players factions ones. In other words, what do you do when Firewall wants the infected habitat earth-scorched but your Extropian sponsor wants a sample of the virus ? (and the Titanian teammate by yourside wants to bring back some survivors). Reward players XP for accomplishing these factional agendas and each mission potentially turns into a boiling pot of interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435019/#Comment_435019" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-08T22:40:32+00:00" title="July  8, 2014 10:40PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD makes a good point.
