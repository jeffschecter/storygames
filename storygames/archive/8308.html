I think that most of us are toeing the same party line, that recommending your friends games is perfectly okay. There are a few dissenting voices, which is perfectly okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of this thread is different than that other one. The point of this thread is to tell us about your friends' great games. <br/>\n<br/>\nFriend, for the definition of this post, is someone whom you have had more than cursory contact with. Someone you have interacted with only in passing on the message boards, for instance, is not a friend. As such, most of you are not my friends for the purposes of this thread. Do not recommend any game that you love to distraction if the person who made it is not your friend by this definition. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you tell us how great your friend's game is, tell us why you love it. Tell us what it does that makes it great. Posts in this thread should be for that purpose, or for asking for more information about a game. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll kick this off with two great games made by friends of mine that I have regrettably not played in years. <br/>\n<br/>\nFastlane, by Alexander Cherry: This game is great because it took a silly concept and turned it into a tight, well executed game that has managed to reliably produce powerful and fun situations either in extended play or in one-shots. It's daring, asking gamers to go way beyond what they're used to when it comes to accouterments. That, by itself, makes me love this game. <br/>\n<br/>\nSitting down to play it during playtesting, and a couple times since has made me love it more. I love the fact that luck allowed me to have more mechanical narrative power than the GM. I love the fact that the same luck of the spin brought another player up enough to kick my ass, the very same dude I hammered badly earlier in the game when he'd refused to owe my character favors. The flexibility of the concept of favors is amazing. I hacked a computer by humbling it to owe me a favor. How fucking cool is that? I called in favors to disable security alarms, open doors, and delay a self-destruct sequence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mechanics make for convoluted situations of debts, bought loyalties and shifting alliances. This shit happened with players used to the party mentality as naturally as if we'd been playing this way for years. The game, while completely without setting, keeps that signature feel whether you're playing sci-fi on a Las Vegas planet, or gritty superheroes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Riddle of Steel, by Jacob Norwood: I loved this game from minute one of doing any research. It's a big, unapologetically crunchy game with traditional mechanics. The combat system is a fun game all by itself. I spent hours dueling with another fan of the game, just putting the combat system through it's paces. What I like about this is that you can just play the game, and the mechanics describe what happens in the fiction. When I stab someone in the chest, it's not an abstract subtraction of wound points. The mechanical description is that I just stabbed someone in the fucking chest. A rapier entering my throat and going up into my brain will kill my ass. (and did, on at least two occasions, while dueling against Julianos Vainsteel)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you bring in the concept of SAs. I was skeptical at first. I've been conditioned to be skeptical about mechanical implementations of personality mechanics. But this one was different than what I've seen before. Foremost, it's a carrot, not a stick. I mean, sure.. There's some talk about using SAs punitively, but Jake admitted that he's never used it, and recommends against it. What it comes down to is the, to me, at that time, revolutionary concept of deciding what is important to you about your character, GOING for it, and being rewarded for doing that, and only for doing that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you've got a combination of a great crunchy combat system, and mechanics that reward you for playing your character to the hilt and without apology. What's not to love about that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183317/#Comment_183317" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T13:37:10+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  1:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Duty &amp; Honour</b><br/><br/>At Gen Con 2007, there I was on the <a href="http://playcollective.org" rel="nofollow">Play Collective</a> stand. A bloke from Newcastle (in England) comes up and asks if he can talk about his game. The chap was Neil Gow and his game was <a href="http://www.omnihedron.co.uk/omnihedron" rel="nofollow">Duty &amp; Honour</a>. His description of what he wanted the game to be was instantly captivating: it would be stories of the Peninsular Wars, told in the style of the Sharpe novels. Great! Now, Neil was a bit unsure about how to develop and produce the game.<br/><br/>Fast forward.<br/><br/>Now, it's late 2008 and Duty &amp; Honour is out there in public, brandishing a sabre and rallying to Wellingtons flag! I love this game for two main reasons:<br/><br/>1) It captures wonderfully the feeling of derring-do you get in the Sharpe books. It also manages to handle a military game, with all the complexities of rank, orders, missions and so forth, in a way that enhances the roleplaying and makes it all fun and exciting.<br/><br/>2) I've been lucky enough to watch D&amp;H grow from an idea into a published book and give my own tiny bit of help along the way. Neil has done a great job and, moreover, he's a credit to himself and the principles of mutualism.<br/><b><br/>Covenant</b><br/><br/>I would also draw your attention an underappreciated game that has been out for a couple of years now. <a href="http://realms.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a> by Matt Machell provided probably the single best gaming experience I had in 2007. The popular notion of the 1990s conspiracy RPG is turned on its head, where the conspiracy has failed and now you, as members of that selfsame conspiracy, have to struggle with the reality of the situation, to come to terms with what is and isn't true. The way that Covenant sets the game up is really key to what makes it great. Cell creation is deceptively simple but feeds into the characters in a way that means right from the off, you have a whole web of relationships, intrigues, friendships and rivalries. A great game that gets too little attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183320/#Comment_183320" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T13:54:14+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  1:54PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for finding the positive in that thread, Lance.<br/><br/>I keep saying I love my friend Anna Kreider's Polaris hack, Thou Art But A Warrior, so I'll continue to flack for it here.  TABAW is everything I like and nothing I don't.  It "corrects" all the things that make Polaris a less than perfect fit for me - it's rooted in something I can relate to and learn about (The Reconquista!), it's populated with characters I can appreciate and care about (Muslim Iberia!), and it has both an index and table of contents.  It does all this while leaving room for wonder, and fantasy, and the will of God to manifest itself in terrible and awe-inspiring ways.  So for me the really cool, fun stuff about Polaris (the rotating division of authority, the phrases and compromise built into resolving conflicts, the built-in tragic arc) is retained and even amplified by telling an essentially human story.  Plus (like Polaris) the art's great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Books%20Burner" title="Books Burner"><img alt="Books Burner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/2913/avwg2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Books%20Burner">Books Burner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183324/#Comment_183324" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T14:11:28+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  2:11PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2008 2:11PM by Books Burner.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what is going on, but again\n<blockquote>I just can't wait for Amazing game called:<br/>Illumination!<br/>It's how Mage (from WoD universe) should be made! </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183328/#Comment_183328" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T14:33:41+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  2:33PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Jacek, Filip, in the interest of productive recommendation, can you tell us anything about why you like these games, why they're great?

Very much an experience; very little a game.<br/><br/>- L\xf8ken Committee to Evaluate Cultural Grants (H\xe5ken Lid), where players are bureaucrats in the Committee, discussing relevant questions - first, of course, cultural grants; but later questions can be \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone want to make love to me?\u201d or \u201cIs there life after death?\u201d. All questions are discussed in the same detached, bureaucratic tone. Wonderful.<br/><br/>- <a href="http://itrasby.no/" rel="nofollow">Itras By</a> (Ole Peder Gi\xe6ver + Martin Bull Gudmundsen), because of the open setting ("find a section in the book that you don't like and cross it out, then write a new one yourself"), the community effort surrounding it (collaborative design, setting wiki), the chance cards ("time stops", "play this scene as a musical"), the action/resolution cards ("yes, but...", "no, and...")<br/><br/>- Muu (Tomas M\xf8rkrid), a game of empathic creatures with a collective identity ("Muu is Muu"), who are afraid of crows and love strawberries and snuggling.<br/><br/>Sadly, none are available in English at the moment, but we can always hope.

I then got the opportunity to meet him when I was doing Training in the vicinity of Provo Utah, his home town.
