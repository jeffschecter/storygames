It's 30 minutes of RPG goodness in the form of a look at some of the highlights from Bill White's adventure "Rex Rich and the Warlord of Mars" from Dreamation.  The episode looks at the idea of 'GM force' by contrasting a scene where Compels could have been used in the game but weren't, versus a scene where Compels were used to guide the plot in a particular direction.   <br/>Mel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127320/#Comment_127320" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T12:28:09+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 12:28PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was great to listen to.

And thanks for 'checking back in'.  My goal has always been to do more than just say, 'here's a few moments of Awesome, go listen.'  I want the actual play excerpts to have a point--about the rules, about roleplaying theory, about communication between the players...So Bill's expertise on the show helps a lot.  I think the show is hitting its stride, but I welcome any constructive criticism, too.<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127348/#Comment_127348" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T15:51:24+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  3:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that. I often find that some people take "deprotagonization" as a bit too much of a boogeyman (and  I like how the one player took the incident as "scene framing" instead of "deportagonization"), I liked the discussion of how in hindsight the GM could work with the players and achieve the same result with more satisfaction by all involved.<br/><br/>I also found the comments and illustrations about the old habit of "roll for initiative" demarking where you transitioning from pure narration to system-directed gameplay rather interesting.<br/><br/>One technique I have adopted is to, as the GM, act as the players' eyes and ears. They don't know anything about the environment unless you tell them. In turn, (simulationist in me speaking here) to do that in a manner consistent with the character the player has modeled, you should inform the player in accordance with what their skills or abilities say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127359/#Comment_127359" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T16:58:27+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  4:58PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel, I really liked this episode. It demonstrated the strength of AP recordings when used well to illustrate a point and examine a principle of game theory in action. I liked that Bill was willing to discuss it and impressed that he didn't let himself off the hook when Matt said that he hadn't felt deprotagonized himself by your brother's action. I see this episode as doing something that podcasts can excel at, bringing other people's gameplay and interaction into public view for discussion. As much as I like sharing in the Collective Awesome, I find detailed examination of events at the table to be more satisfying and more useful. Its nice to see a podcast trying to show gamers ways to improve their own play through examples of the play of others.

That's where I want Virtual Play to be in every episode; it has taken a while to get here.  The biggest hurdle has been my own understanding of what the theory is, or what the theories are.  I intend to use this episode as a benchmark for future shows.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
