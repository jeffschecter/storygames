There are a few nice-looking products out there, but the majority of LARP scenarios I can find available online are free offerings that are generally rough, relatively poorly formatted and put together, and usually fairly bare-bones when it comes to GM guidance about how to run them. It looks like this is usually because most scenarios are written for a specific group or crowd, and making a copy available online for use by others is an afterthought rather than the primary focus.<br/><br/>I kept this in mind when I was writing <i>Blackened Hearts</i> (released last month, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21375/blackened-hearts-a-pirate-larp-scenario" rel="nofollow">thread here</a>). I wanted to present a LARP scenario that was a bit more polished than a lot of other offerings, and provide a reasonably comprehensive guide on how to run the game, to make it easier for new GMs and players to get into it. While I wish I\u2019d had a bit more money to spend on layout and art, I think I succeeded in creating a product a cut above a lot of other scenarios that are currently around.<br/><br/>The response has been pretty positive and I\u2019ve gotten a lot more downloads than I was expecting. Not only that, but a mildly surprising number of people have been willing to toss me some actual money for a pay-what-you-want product.<br/><br/>One of the players from a playtest group suggested that it might be a good idea to put together a physical product, in addition to having PDFs available \u2013 something with all of the props, all of the name tags, everything, already put together so that a GM could run it out of the box without having to do much more than invite people and prepare a space \u2013 and said that they would almost certainly buy a set if I did. <br/><br/>I sort of dismissed this at the time, but I started thinking about it again recently. I don\u2019t think this sort of LARP scenario \u2018boxed set\u2019 is a thing at all, is it? I certainly haven\u2019t seen or found any, looking around. Does anyone think there could maybe be a market for something like this?<br/><br/>\u2018Murder mystery dinner\u2019 style products have been a thing for a really long time, but as a LARP player I\u2019ve found them to generally be a bit lacklustre. \u2018Escape Room in a Box\u2019 style games appear to be doing quite well recently as well, with a couple of different brands popping up.<br/><br/>Do you think there is a market for this sort of LARP scenario product? A box, complete with GM guidance, props, and everything else you need to run the game? Do you think it\u2019s something that would be worth pursuing, perhaps with a small Kickstarter?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468390/#Comment_468390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-11T13:59:21+00:00" title="December 11, 2017  1:59PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm fairly interested in the same topic and have written <a href="http://www.valis.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/boxing-a-larp.pdf" rel="nofollow">an article about boxing a larp</a>.

People I know who've been through the process of manufacturing a game have run into a lot of stumbles when they need custom gear. But it would be pretty convenient for people wanting to run the game, certainly. Seems like something you'd really want to do in conjunction with an established company that already has a relationship with toy manufacturers.<br/><br/>One more example you might look to is Jay Treat's Strange Gravity, a kind of make-your-own-Star-Trek-LARP game that doesn't come with props, but does break down all the roles into well-designed printed cards, suitable for putting in nametag holders, and with all the necessary info printed on them. That's a step down from a LARP packaged with toys and props, and closer to deck-designed ones like Ghost Court and Juggernaut.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468465/#Comment_468465" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-14T22:56:36+00:00" title="December 14, 2017 10:56PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strange Gravity also has the benefit of being excellent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leprenomichaun" title="Leprenomichaun"><img alt="Leprenomichaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leprenomichaun">Leprenomichaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468469/#Comment_468469" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-15T09:00:18+00:00" title="December 15, 2017  9:00AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Bricoleur">@Bricoleur</a> Yeah, I'm not entirely sure Blackened Hearts is a great candidate for it given the props it needs. How did you go with pricing out props? I found the stumbling block was the coin bags. Hard to get ones that aren't terrible that don't end up being relatively pricey when you're buying 15 of them. Plastic coins are pretty cheap to buy in bulk, and I had plenty of lanyards already lying around from the big box I'd bought for a previous LARP.<br/><br/>Then again, as you say, it's actually a bit of a pain to pull it all together and would be pretty convenient if you could just buy a box. As for doing it with an established company... haha, ah, I'd love to but I'm an indie author nobody who mainly publishes fiction, with only this one LARP scenario under my belt when it comes to RPG stuff. Ain't nobody interested in partnering up with me. Not yet, at least. I have some ideas for another couple of scenarios that I'm thinking about starting to write, so maybe if people keep liking my stuff for a few years I might be able to pull off something like that.<br/><br/>Strange Gravity looks and sounds excellent.

They're <i>interesting</i> and I can understand why people enjoy them, but they're not the sort of thing I want to be immersed in. <br/><br/>For example, look at this description for one of the scenarios in Crescendo Giocoso:\n<blockquote><i>In First they came, the players will step into the shoes of three opponents of the Third Reich to discover the pain and paranoia carved in the hearts of the German people by the persecutions of the regime. By reliving the characters\u2019 trials, they will have a chance to understand how they came to their predicament. What mistakes and atrocities did they condone to save their own lives? Were they part of the problem, as well?</i></blockquote>\nMore various bits snipped from other descriptions:\n<blockquote><i>What will happen when others strike at us with harrowing revelations about ourselves?<br/><br/>The game mechanics aim to trigger a spiral of crushing paranoia ... <br/><br/>... a means to experience emotion, and emotion is a vessel for self-discovery ...<br/><br/>... a postmodern tragedy ...</i></blockquote>\nNone of these things sound very fun to me, at all.

But the last LARP I ran needed little resource bags too, so I can always repurpose them for the next one. And I'm already thinking about running this again at a gaming con in late February, since I agreed to run something there, so having extras is a good idea. <br/><br/>Also, I've spent less than $50 on this so far, and when you divide that out by entertaining 15 people for an evening, it's less than $4 per person.
