Spanning the Classical Age (508-322 BC), the game would be a close historical simulation of life and death in the Athenian social and political arena.  Players would create a citizen of Athens, a member of a circle of friends of the same age group who would aid one another in their triumphs and their tragedies -- or perhaps grow resentful and seek to do political harm to their one-time friends.  War, commerce, politics, back-stabbing, prosecution, ostracism, exile, redemption . . . it would cover the spectrum of ancient Athenian aristocratic life.  Would you risk exile to avenge yourself against an enemy?  Would you seek wealth and court disfavor by dealing with foreign powers?  Would you go to war against the Thebans, the Aegintans, the fearsome Spartans?  Would you attend the great religious festivals and broker for power in the shadows, or expound your convictions from the couches of the wealthy at exclusive symposia?<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, the game idea presupposes two things: 1) that the characters are all male, and 2) that the characters are all sons of citizens in good standing with the Athenian polis.  This seems narrow when judged by the standards of the hobby, where ancient gender bias is often overlooked, but if ATTIKA seeks to recreate accurate history then it must also recreate all its warts and flaws.  But, there were some quite influential women in the Classical Age, such as Pericles' mistress, Aspasia.  How might a game of political dealings take advantage of women's roles, when women were forbidden from taking part in the process (and, indeed, most were forbidden from leaving the house without a male family member as escort)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what should come first?  Should a game like this launch directly into character creation, or should it begin with an overview of the city and the times?  Is there a way to combine the two by weaving the history in with the mechanics?  I love the system used in PRINCIPIA, but I'd also add a way to determine a character's name, father's name, deme and tribe.  What gifts might the gods have graced characters with?  A silver-tongue, a sculptor's eye, a lion's courage?  And, how will these gifts be used?  How can delivering a rousing speech before the Assembly or staging Aeschylus' new drama for the City Dionysia become an exciting facet of the game?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould IAWA-style oracles be a good way to set the scene for players who may not have a deep grounding in ancient history?  Or the scene-setting tables from FIASCO?  Or is there another way to impart very location-specific information to players so they might help bring the scenes alive?<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, should an unstated goal of ATTIKA be the teaching of Classical history?  I recall Samuel Goldwyn's advice to writers: "If you want to send a message, call Western Union!"  Should the same hold true for games?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333072/#Comment_333072" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T14:17:10+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  2:17PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2011 2:20PM by tony_dowler.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are asking some good questions here, but instead of trying to answer them right away, I'm just going to bask in the joy I feel radiating from the fact that you're taking on this idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333095/#Comment_333095" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T17:44:18+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  5:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bask away, good sir!

The mechanics evoke the period of Classical Athens as wonderfully as they evoke alt-Florence.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome Positions I've come up with so far are these:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Actor<br/>\nThe Artist<br/>\nThe Eupatrid (ancient Aristocracy)<br/>\nThe Landowner<br/>\nThe Merchant (covers all sorts of tradesmen, factory owners, etc)<br/>\nThe Olympian<br/>\nThe Orator<br/>\nThe Philosopher (the sciences were also grouped under philosophy)<br/>\nThe Poet<br/>\nThe Seer<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to add a "track" to the character sheet that charts public opinion (probably something like -3/-2/-1/0/+1/+2/+3).  Called <i>Philotimia</i> when it's positive and <i>Atimia</i> when it's negative, it's voted to a player by other players or the GM, in response to good/bad roleplaying, in-character deeds, acting contrary to one's position, etc.; it can be used during Controversy as advantages or disadvantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother mechanic I've given some thought to is something that mimics Greek reliance on omens and oracles: a roll performed at the beginning of each game session that checks if the character is operating under divine favor or disfavor for that session, along with guidelines for expiating any disfavor in-game as part of the narration.  I worry, though, that too many additional dice or penalties might upset the game's balance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333435/#Comment_333435" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T23:54:01+00:00" title="July  6, 2011 11:54PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2011 12:01AM by John_Harper.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is exciting stuff! Go Scott go!<br><br>One note about gender roles:<br>History has been written with biases, as I'm sure you well know. Just because certain scholars utterly failed to grasp the vital and powerful roles played by women throughout the ages, that doesn't mean they didn't exist. For a roleplaying game spanning the classical age of Athens, playing a female should not only be viable, it's arguably <i>more</i> interesting and primed for gaming than playing a male is. I'd urge you to keep digging into the material, and find the hooks and possibilities to make both options fun (and also maybe offer more than just a binary choice -- the ancient world had more roles than just man/woman, after all).<br><br>(For inspiration, check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B3WhY8dTQpdEYzg5ZGVjNmItODIzMC00YWQyLWFjYjgtZGNiZDBhNWJiOTM5&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CPnU_v8K" rel="nofollow">Sagas of the Icelanders</a> hack, which features gender roles as a major character component -- males and females get different moves!)                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333449/#Comment_333449" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T05:41:40+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  5:41AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good points, John!  From a game standpoint, it <i>would</i> be more fun to play Aspasia than to play Pericles, himself -- the latter need only decide what direction to take the polis and garner enough votes in the Assembly to make it happen (through deal-making, bribery, or outright intimidation), while his mistress has a whole different set of hoops to jump through in order to make her vision of Athens a reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne possible way to do this might be to divide the Positions into citizen and non-citizen.  Non-citizens (foreigners, called metics, women, and even slaves) were barred from taking part in city politics, but still helped shape the city.  Using the "Metic Rule" would open the landscape up to Ionian orators, Theban seers, poets from Keos, landowners from Euboea . . . all equal in wealth and social standing, but lacking the ability to overtly influence Athenian politics.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen's roles might include Hetairai (well-educated courtesans like Aspasia or Thais, the woman who goaded Alexander the Great into burning the Persian city of Persepolis), Seers or wisewomen, priestesses, poets (think Sappho); and if they're of the aristocratic class in Athens, part of their panoply might include a body servant or guard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe overall goal to ATTIKA is to make a Mary Renault novel come to life, and I think the inclusion of women and non-citizens would go a long way toward meeting that goal.

I will consider it strongly, DWeird!  My thanks!<br><br>And I am coming around to to the idea of making it less rigorously historical.  The trappings of history remain, such as only allowing citizens (males) to take an overt part in city politics, but allowing for the kind of back-channel intrigue that surely *must* have existed.  Thus, foreigners (metics) can use wealth or public opinion to sway the voting bloc, women can use their skills, charms, or shrewd good sense to make the men do what needs to be done (perhaps Aristophanes based his [i]Lysistrata[/i] on some real women he knew . . . or didn't "know" *grin*).

Though he embraces a later date than the game to serve as his "day" (360 BC, when the city was at its architectural height), it still oozes relevance to ATTIKA; pair this with quotes from Xenophon, Plutarch, Pausanias, and the different philosophers and playwrights, and it would create quite a vibrant portrait of the city where the game's action takes place.<br><br>So, what do I do with it?
