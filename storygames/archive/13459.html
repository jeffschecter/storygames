I've been rattling around some core ideas in my head for a while (with regards to coming up with my own narrative designs), and I was wondering if someone who has more experience with what's out there has come across something like this that I could use as a reference...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn boardgames, some co-operatives games use what is known as a "traitor mechanic" where at the start of the game cards are secretly dealt out, and while everyone is thematically a part of the team, a few of the players are secretly working against the team to cause the team to fail. This usually creates a nice bit on tension in the game, with accusations and suspicions being thrown around the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I'm wondering if there is a similar kind of thing in RPG-world, where at the start of the game, you are given a stated secret goal for your character that is not necessarily the outwardly way you play the character. I am trying to make this as GM-less as possible. And by giving players conflicting secret goals, this allows players excuses to select non-optimum (for the team) choices as the game goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs my example...I have this goal of trying to make a story game around the theme of what I would call "a traditional ghost story," as opposed to horror, gory monsters. One player plays a character who is being haunted, while the other players are people who have been recruited/volunteered to help find out the mystery of the ghostly hauntings. Ultimately,  the game is the players investigating and building the story of the mystery behind the hauntings, while the hauntings get more and more powerful and damaging.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the character creation phase is simply selecting relationship roles with regards to the focus of the hauntings (such as neighbor, estranged family member, religious guide, paranormal investigator, etc), plus two motivation cards, one which would be played faceup to indicate their outwardly motivations, and one which is played face down (their secret motivation). Motivations are fairly simple and open-to-interpretations, such as CARING, or JUST IN IT FOR THE MONEY. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while a player can openly be playing a CARING RELIGIOUS GUIDE, his secret motivation could be MUST KEEP THE MYSTERY A SECRET AT ALL COSTS. So, at some point, ideally that priest you thought was helping you solve the mystery would turn on the team in order to keep the mystery a secret.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any references for this kind of thing that I can be pointed to?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303500/#Comment_303500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T19:52:55+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  7:52PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Mountain Witch does exactly this, with a possible traitor in the group.

To further the intrigue, they also have a Personal Agenda which is known only to them, which is often at odds with even their nation's agenda.<br/>They are rewarded for persuing these agendas by an increase in dice pools, but betraying other people's interests leads them to give you less dice later on for help.  Trust is a double-edged sword.<br/><br/>Annalise, each player generates a character with a Vulnerability, which is known to everyone.  But then, each character gets a Secret, which they can draw strength from, but they are heavily penalized if it is discovered.  If they can keep it until the confrontation with the Vampire, they can gain strength from it.<br/><br/>Spione, each character has a shameful or terrible secret, which they can reveal to their close friends at some cost.  They can't trust the NPCs to keep the secret, but it increases the friends chances of survival in certain situations.<br/><br/>Annalise and Spione are gm-less games.<br/><br/>Not many of these games are necessarily competitive, in the way you're looking for, I think.  Cold City is great fun for players who are willing to play on one another's trust and relationships, and kinda falls flat if you actually work together.<br/><br/>The Mountain Witch is very much a game of secrets and betrayals.  The Dark Fates allow a player to introduce things into the story line to foreshadow the fate and lay the ground work for its big reveal.  Again, it has a GM, but it's full of "non-optimum" choices.  Each of the ronin knows that the money offered as a reward is only enough to fulfill <i>one</i> of the ronin's desires.  It's expected that either they will have to compromise their dreams eventually, or they will have to murder each other when opportunity is right.  The balancing factor is that it's very difficult to get anything done alone in that game.  The dice are against you mightily.<br/><br/>You seem to be describing the boardgames Battlestar Gallactica, and House on Haunted Hill perhaps?

Mountain Witch is the most obvious example of a game that does precisely this.<br/><br/>I would just mention that in any game (we even did it with D&amp;D, back in the day) where the player (characters) have their own strong ambitions, beliefs and motivations, this kind of thing can happen without explicit mechanical support. With a few techniques and perhaps a rule or two you can do it in most games (just make sure people are on board with it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303527/#Comment_303527" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-07T00:27:58+00:00" title="December  7, 2010 12:27AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you compared the experiences of playing with hidden agendas to those of playing where the players have full insight even if the characters do not?<br/><br/>I'm coming from a gaming culture where things are as you describe, but I found that the stories got a lot better and more interesting when the players have full insight.<br/><br/>That way you can set scenes that touch upon the secret and making it a prominent part of the story, as opposed to it being secret to every but one player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303565/#Comment_303565" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-07T09:21:17+00:00" title="December  7, 2010  9:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the same topic as Wilhelm, hidden information in story games can also be an issue since nothing is 'real' until it's enforced by the rules or entered into the shared fiction.

SO to make this fast...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the Mountain Witch tidbit. I'll definitely look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe long and short of trying to do secret motivations, as opposed to open motivations at the authorship level, but secret at the character level, is that the people who I would play with are:<br/>\n--primarily boardgamers, and understand the concept.<br/>\n--have a hurdle with the player buy-in of trusting the improv-ness of it all, and need some structure to feel comfortable.<br/>\n--some have issues with "playing a game where there is no winners or losers." By giving them a secret goal of "revealing their true intentions at the worst possible time for the rest of the players," this would give them a sense of "winning."<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I like the feel of unease when not knowing where exactly the other players around you stand. I'm not sure if one can get that same feeling if you know at the authorship level that kind of data.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303575/#Comment_303575" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-07T10:52:44+00:00" title="December  7, 2010 10:52AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It totally depends on the situation.<br/><br/>Even in The Mountain Witch, everyone at the table knows that there are only six Dark Fates, and they know what they are.  No one but the player who is dealt the card knows who has what at the beginning, even the GM.  But by the second or third chapter, most astute players will start to guess who is holding what card.<br/><br/>Sometimes, you want to buy in to another player's situation and help them reach an epic low before they reveal.<br/><br/>Sometimes, you want to manipulate their situation into conflict with another character.<br/><br/>Sometimes, you want to be the target of their Dark Fate, just to make yourself look like an "innocent victim" to the others.<br/><br/>For us it was a level of comfort issue.  The first few times, it was fun to throw "haha, you THOUGHT I had Revenge against your character, but no, I have Dark Pact!  You see, that ogre in chapter two was... [villainous monologue]"<br/><br/>After experimenting with a few more games, it became more fun for us (every group is different) to all know as players what the secrets of other characters are.  (The Mountain Witch doesn't explicitly allow this; I'm talking about Cold City and the like.)  That way when we know John Baymont has a drinking problem he's fighting hard to keep a secret, we can all as players suggest he might be three sheets to the wind when his boss arrives for dinner one night, but he's doing his damnedest to keep it cool.  It creates a fun dramatic irony where all the players know something that the characters don't.<br/><br/>To address the other issues you brought up, The Mountain Witch can have a clear winner and looser, at the character level.  (I would argue that there are no winners or losers at the player level, but that's another story.)  Tell them up front that only one of them is going to get this ransom, and let them know that they can compete on that.<br/><br/>As for the improv-ness, just work them through a few dice rolls, because the total burden of narrating a conflict falls to the winner.  They'll get used to it pretty quick, and get confidence enough to foreshadow their Dark Fates.<br/><br/>And the game is infamous for having the GM stop literally mid-sentence and letting a player jump up and finish it to detail what's in a scene.  Add a cast of NPCs and monsters with loaded questions, and players will be adding huge to the narrative on a very comfortable and familiar level.<br/><br/>As for the last comment, I love the unease of not knowing where exactly another character stands on something.  I'm personally not all that comfortable with not knowing where a player stands.  So my opinions and suggestions will be colored by that.  I totally respect your opinion, I'm just letting you know where I'm coming from in case we disagree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303701/#Comment_303701" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T13:13:45+00:00" title="December  8, 2010  1:13PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal experience is that communication is difficult and noisy enough most times without adding a whole new layer of hidden influences to distort things. <br/><br/>Also, I've had the bad experience, several times, of playing in a group where a character's Dark Secret meant they were the Special Snowflake and were constantly passing notes to the GM and talking in veiled language.
