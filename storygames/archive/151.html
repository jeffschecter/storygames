                    My wife and I lusted after and bought the <a href="http://bluerose.greenronin.com/" rel="nofollow">Blue Rose</a> rulebook immediately after it was released because the game setting was powerfully intriguing.  For those of you who don't know, it's a setting based off of "Romantic Fantasy" which, in short form, is Girly Fantasy Novels.  So there are psychic powers, lifebonded animals, an emphasis on romance, winged cats, and the like.  The centerpiece of the setting is the Kingdom of Aldis, an enlightened nation based on principles of acceptance of difference and equality of all people -- male, female, straight, gay, of whatever race and creed et cetera.  It's like the fantasy version of the Federation.<br/><br/><em><strong>This thread is not intended to comment on the viability or appopriateness of that setting.</strong></em>  If you want to talk about how the book obsessed about gay people, go start your own damn thread.<br/><br/>This very intriguing setting was then hitched up to a d20 variant, True20.  So the setting and color and focus of the game kept talking about making peace between agitated parties, spreading acceptance and equality, and living up to your ideals.  And the system gave you tools for killing monsters.  In a game that was supposed to be all about how you related with your fellow man, there was little in the way of support for creating, building, and manipulating those relationships.  There were some rudimentary social mechanics, but they were, well, rudimentary, and had more than making people do things than convincing them of what you believed.<br/><br/>My wife and I have since talked about using a modified Dogs in the Vineyard dice system to play in the Blue Rose setting -- thereby allowing the characters to roll into a village in trouble and set things right, or confront big bad necromancers not on the basis of my +2 sword but on the basis on my beliefs (maybe backed up by my sword).<br/><br/>In a parallel case, I wrote up a little microgame called <a href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/?p=90" rel="nofollow">Shadows and Strings</a> that attempts to take what the World of Darkness <em>promised</em> (dark supernatural conspiracies from the shadows of the modern world) and actually deliver (as opposed to pumping your vampire powers to kick someone's ass).<br/><br/>Has anyone else experienced similar situations where what the book promised was not supported by the system it offered, and you either munged the system or created a new system entirely to get you what you wanted and hadn't got from the book?                </div>

                            Funny, the "old games we love" thread dredged up the Morrow Project in my mind, which fits this bill perfectly.  You are cryogenically frozen and prepped to rebuild America after a nuclear war you know is coming.  Whoops!  You accidentally sleep for 250 years!  America is no more - time to regroup, reorganize, make contact and rebuild from the dark ages up.  Cool, huh?  I guess it would be if the game wasn't, inexplicably, obsessively focused on gunfights with automatic weapons.  I was like twelve when I was playing it, and even then I couldn't figure out where all the heavily armed bad guys got their gear after 250 years.  Why weren't people terrified of our fusion-powered armored cars?  Why weren't we distributing antibiotics and fixing cataracts?  And so forth.  We were, as a whole, entirely <em>fine</em> with all the straight-up killing, but if we'd wanted to, say, talk to the local populace, there was nothing in the game to support it.  But if you needed to know the penetration, in inches of white pine, of an M16A1 (15, IIRC), you were covered.                        </div>

                            Bloody hell. <br/><br/>Just about all the games I own. <br/><br/>I have to wonder how many people right now are playing A Game of Thrones and fighting monsters when the reason they loved the books is the boys romance novel aspect of sister-fucking backstabbing political fun.                        </div>

                            I'm reading <i>A Game of Thrones RPG</i>, based on the George R. R. Martin book of the same name. It uses a variant D20 rules system that seems to do the setting justice. I'm about half way through the monster, but they've managed to drift Gamist-supporting rules enough that it'll support AGOT much better. They've done this with new classes that map to roles in the books, modified combat rules that are more cinematic, rules for influence and reputation, and so on. I'm pretty impressed with their ability to tweak D20 to good purpose.<br/><br/>There's not a lot in it (so far) that really <i>supports</i> strong Sim play, but I don't see a ton of stuff there that will get in the way.                        </div>

                            Adam, <br/><br/>I think that A Game of Thrones did a very good job of moving the world and the d20 engine closer together. But in the end the system, at its very best, doesn't help. Its best claim is that -- as you say -- it doesn't get in the way. <br/><br/>OTOH, it has some of the best written setting material for a liscenced RPG yet. Whoever did the stuff on the major characters of the setting, for example, knew their shit and did way more than the normal "here is a recap of what the character said!" that you get in such books. Some good high-level anaylsis went in there, and really lays the inner workings of the characters open. <br/><br/>Which makes me wish they'd had a system that could support that level of awesomeness. But, I guess that much of their target market is the sort that wants mechanics that handle the things that aren't interesting so that they can use their personal system to handle the things that are.                        </div>

                            When the play is about the Right to Dream in ____ world, as so many movie or book conversions are, the rules really need to address Constructive Denial.

                            I must concur, it would be easier to list those games which have succeeded in this than those which have failed.  That said, Weapons of the Gods is fresh in my mind, though the fact that it succeeded at doing what Exalted promises is, perhaps, a bit less direct than one might hope.<br/>

                            Well, you know the answer today is always "Get out PTA".  I think I mentioned in another thread that the Morrow Project could also weather a rigorous Dogsification pretty nicely.

I agree with Rob, though: it would be easier to list the games that succeed here than the ones that failed. One recent, blatant, ugly failure, though: The <i>Serenity</i> RPG. Ouch.                        </div>

<p>Bizarrely enough, I think <em>Exalted</em> succeeds, but in a sort of weird, ungainly way.</p>
<p>There is not much in there that helps you deal with the situations you get into when your characters are mad, lopsided god-kings with immense blind spots and spoiled-teenager complexes, but the Charm system is a great insidious way to make those characters.</p>

<p>Honestly, what I'm doing right now?</p>
<p>I'm playing in a game where we know that's what the characters are, and we are revelling in depicting it, unsystematically. That is, for me, for that group, enough.</p>
<p>(more methodically)</p>
<p>What tends to happen is that we point out plot threads that intrigue us, and these have tended to be threads in which either a new facet of the madness unfolds, or one where we unleash it on the world. So far, our adversity has been mainly external rather than fed by these weaknesses; there are other reasons I won't go into, but the main one, I think, is that we are not <em>done</em> breaking the characters yet, and we want it to be really good when they snap.</p>

<i>Has anyone else experienced similar situations where what the book promised was not supported by the system it offered, and you either munged the system or created a new system entirely to get you what you wanted and hadn't got from the book?</i><br/><br/>Usually I don't.  If I'm not playing a system as-is, I'll usually generate my background from non-gaming sources or whole cloth; and adapt some system to fit.  I think the closest case of this was my Vinland campaign.  I started from RuneQuest because I liked the basics for the feel of the campaign, and also it had a decent Vikings sourcebook.  However, I ended up making a lot of adjustments to the rules.  I've got a page summarizing that: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/vinland/about/rules.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/vinland/about/rules.html</a><br/><br/>Mostly those were big simplifications down.  I added Whimsy Cards which were pretty popular.  I replaced completely the Wealth system and the magic system.  <br/><br/>By the way, I checked out Blue Rose a while ago and wrote a capsule review -- putting it at above average but pointing out various problems.  Since then I've playtested the system, and was even more disappointed in it.  (I've also read some Mercedes Lackey, which I hadn't when I wrote the review.)  Anyhow, I've got some material here:<br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/bluerose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/bluerose/</a><br/><br/>As for better systems for it...  Hmm.  Dogs in the Vineyard seems like a poor fit to me.  The inherent logic of the system is that if you can't get something by talking, you can <i>always</i> escalate to violence to improve your chances.  That's not true to my understanding of the Romantic Fantasy genre.  There are times when you need to use violence, while at other times using violence is absolutely the wrong answer and escalating is a mistake.  In Dogs, characters engage in violence and risk death by choice via escalation.  In Romantic Fantasy, characters usually engage in violence when they are forced to, though they shine under pressure.  Put another way, I feel it's an aggressive, conflict-rewarding, masculine system.  <br/><br/>That said, I'm not sure I know of a base system which would work well for it.  One thing is that Romantic Fantasy as a genre has a central protagonist and a bunch of strong supporting characters.  This suits a structure like Ars Magica or Buffy where there are strongly differentiated PCs rather than the more typical ensemble of equals.                        </div>

                            John, keep in mind that you can "escalate" from violence to talking just as easily as talking to violence.  In our hypothetical Blue Rose Dogs system, there'd just be more d4s that go along with violence.                        </div>

                            At this point, I can't stand that kind of disconnect. So I write a system. Unfortunately, this turns out to take months at best.<br/>
<br/>
I think the issue is this: figure out what the setting you like is about. Then look at how designers answer what their game is about and look for a match.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs is about the consequences of decisions about violence as a moral authority. Shock: is about challenging the social ethics of the players. The Mountain Witch is about loyalty in the face of contradictory desires (which, after all, lead to suffering). D&amp;D is about tactical application of resources to gain more resources to be spent strategically on tactical resources. My Life with Master is about being a terrible bureaucrat to retain your humanity.<br/>
<br/>
And so forth. Find something that matches. I bet something does.                        </div>

                            Those are perfectly acceptable routes of conflict in Dogs. The Just Talking phase, where you gain social fallout, and thereby benefit from your Traits and Stats, can be the part where you discover that you have no choice but to fight.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you could easily make devastating comments be as powerful as guns, if you wanted to do a little tweaking. But you'd first have to figure out if that's what you want.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds, John, like you want a system where talking and fighting are equally powerful in their domains, though. That's a neat idea. I think Burning Wheel does that.                        </div>

                            I hear you, John.  It boils down to what you want out of the game -- the divide between talking and violence isn't important to my understanding of the genre, but if it was (as it seems it is for you) then yeah, something else like Burning Wheel might be appropriate.                        </div>

                            Interestingly, the true20 system is not as bland in play as it appears on paper. Nonetheless, some of the descriptions in the core rule book don't make much sense without the companion. So, when we playes Blue Rose for the first time most of the nonsensical things (in the frame of the rules presented) where 'explained away' with the ironic off-hand remark "itÃ‚Â´s romantic fantasy", which became something like a running gag over the whole session and led to to or three outbursts of hyterical laughter.<br/>
<br/>
I did play Dogs-transported-to-Blue-Rose - more specifically, the neighbor state of 'Good Aldis', which is based on a monotheistic spin off of the typical fantasy pantheon. That also worked quite well, although I longed for guns now and then (actual play to be found at the indie rpgs forum). <br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I don't think the game wins much by switching to the DitV ruleset, especially because of the skewered conflict dynamics.You'd try to bring in the shadow and arcana, which is not the same. In it's basis, there is an outside denominator for good and evil, which DitV does not support rules-wise, and which is hard to bring into without breaking conflict dynamics as presented by the rule set even more.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the escalation to violence is cut short, and thus all might fit more into the 'fantasy mold' that Blue Rose fits into than with a gun equivalent. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't say that you cannot use the true20 rules, but then I am a sucker for the roots of the system (M&amp;M) and think that Steve Kenson played a mind trick on the d20 proponents by changing all the rules to a basic 'both parties roll a d20, highest 2 rolls out of 3 win'. A lot of what is usually occupied by stupid ruleset tricks now is free for narration and other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the abstract damage system is gold. It's a good midway point between something like DitV's fallout and D&amp;D's hit point. I may need to elaborate on this particular point in another thread, probably.                        </div>

                            Answering Joshua's original question, I'm experiencing this disconnect right now with the Legend of the Five Rings (3rd edition) campaign I'm running right now. While the back cover blurb proclaims, "Honesty. Courage. Compassion. Courtesy. Sincerity. Duty. Honor. In Rokugan these are more than simply words," the system that actually deals with these concepts is under-developed. There are plenty of rules and kewl powerz but for reinforcing (or enforcing) the Japanese samurai/bushido mindset and behavior of the setting, I think it falls on its face.<br/>
<br/>
Really, if the the designers had gone the route Pendragon did with the knightly virtues I think it would have been a lot better. As it is, you really have to dig through a poorly laid out (although pretty) set of rules to find out what's up with Honor and Glory and such, and then when you get there, the rules for them are, IMHO, uninspired. Those things should have been front and center, and there should have been no doubt whatsoever that is what playing a character in this game setting is about. Instead, you get pages and pages of stuff that mostly winds up being modifiers to your to hit roll.<br/>
<br/>
My players (bless 'em) are doing just fine in terms of having their characters behave according to the tenets of bushido without implementing those rules (in fact I find myself ignoring them in play, so little is their actual affect on the game). <br/>
<br/>
It's a shame because so much could have been done there. If the game were truly about the tenets of bushido, I'd've thought the rules regarding those things would have been front and center in the system. But any such space is taken up by yet more kewl powerz.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we're going to finish this campaign out, but I very much doubt I will use the L5R ruleset again (if I use them again) without implanting a strong set of Pendragon-ish type rules to deal with bushido and how following it's concepts affects the characters in play.<br/>
<br/>
So, thumbs down to AEG for missing the chance to really tie the setting to the system here.                        </div>

It's been my contention that samurai games are a perfect place for this sort of fusion of setting and system.  You take the samurai code and make them the attributes of the characters, and build a system around them.  End of story.  But I think that the fear of not having pages of different kinds of katanas is what drives designers towards including intricate combat systems.<br/><br/>It's the fear of basing a samurai duel around the Compassion stat, for example.  The idea that the players will come to such a junction, go WTFBBQ?! and drop the game - or not buy it in the first place.  Never mind that it might be what the fight is about in the first place.                        </div>

The inherent logic of the system is that if you can't get something by talking, you can always escalate to violence to improve your chances. That's not true to my understanding of the Romantic Fantasy genre. There are times when you need to use violence, while at other times using violence is absolutely the wrong answer and escalating is a mistake. In Dogs, characters engage in violence and risk death by choice via escalation. In Romantic Fantasy, characters usually engage in violence when they are forced to, though they shine under pressure. Put another way, I feel it's an aggressive, conflict-rewarding, masculine system.</blockquote>
You could modify Dogs so that you only escalate inside talking, with no go-to-guns option except as a fallout.  I'll have to re-read my Dogs to make sure that I'm phrasing that right, but I think it is ...<br/><br/>The basic idea - that the duel itself is the ugly fallout of the conflict, as opposed to part of it.                        </div>

                            couldn't agree with you more Kuma. While I was squinting my way through the L5R rules I was thinking the exact same thing (making the samurai code the actual  attributes of the characters). Pendragon didn't quite do this, but the way it brought the code of chivalry to the fore really made the system/setting "meld" for me anyway.                        </div>
