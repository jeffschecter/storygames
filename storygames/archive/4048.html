Compunded to me scratching my head about condensing the long form into even one session is, that I haven't been to alot of cons to see these demos and how they operate.

The mechanics involve a bit of prescene competition that asks players to bid for positions in the scene to come, and further there's and other player's destinies.  In scene, the character at center stage has the reins of the story, with the Director framing and presenting conflicts.  The character in other positions have various abilities based on where they are positioned, being able to swoop in and take control if the center stage character fails at a conflict, or be there to support the center stage character.  I need a better blurb line than all that, but that's some of what it does.  Overall its a game about revealing these character's destinies and what it means for the story and what it ultimately means for the world in the story.  Should I demo the blocking or what the different position do in scenes?<br/>\n<br/>\nJason, thanks for the link sir.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90512/#Comment_90512" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T14:29:37+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  2:29PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In fifteen minutes, you can basically do the following if you've practiced and are prepared:<br><br>1.  Give a short overview of the game and what it is about.<br/>2.  Explain the most compelling and necessary mechanic.<br/>3.  Throw the demo-er into a situation where they get to make one major choice.<br/>4.  Determine the outcome of that choice and illustrate why the game makes that cool.<br/>5.  Explain what's tasty about the full game that you had to leave out of the demo.  <br/><br/>So for your demo, hand them a character who is about to reveal their destiny, maybe, and let them tear it up.  Better yet, have them leap in when the hero about to reveal his destiny botches it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90515/#Comment_90515" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T14:45:00+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  2:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That would be awesome way to handle it Mr. Morningstar;  I guess I've been having a hard time at figuring out where to launch into it....that's a great place to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
