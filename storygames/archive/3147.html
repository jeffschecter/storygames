In it was some of my college Philosophy books and the like, and underneath was a pile of stuff from my childhood: Picture scrapbook, something I did for a grade school science project called "The Metric System Scrapbook", and a choose-your-own adventure book I made for a class project back in like 4th or 5th grade, called "<b>Pathfinder: Tunnels of Input</b>".<br/><br/>We were gaming at my place, and when I mentioned this to my French friend, he too mentioned that:<br/>- He too made his own Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book as a kid.<br/>- He thinks that CYOA books were a direct lead into him trying out Role-Playing Games many years ago.<br/><br/>Sure enough, another member of the group, too, created his own simple CYOA book as a kid, and also read a lot of them before he started gaming as well.<br/><br/>In all cases:<br/>- We loved CYOA books<br/>- We started gaming, and on thinking about it, may have fallen in love with gaming because of the CYOA elements of it, and<br/>- Pretty much stopped reading CYOA books abruptly after taking up gaming as a kid<br/><br/>Coincidence?  That's what I'm wondering.

These were CYOA with some basic attribute, combat and magic rules thrown in.<br/><br/>I also remember having some books that were meant to be played with a friend.

There was also a series that mostly graphics and was basically a first-person shooter for two players.<br/><br/>All said, I'm sure I've probably logged more hours curled up with those things than in actual play at a table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71821/#Comment_71821" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T10:02:48+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 10:02AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>In all cases:<br/>- We loved CYOA books<br/>- We started gaming, and on thinking about it, may have fallen in love with gaming because of the CYOA elements of it, and<br/>- Pretty much stopped reading CYOA books abruptly after taking up gaming as a kid</blockquote>\nHuh.

I'm referring specifically to that series, not to all solo gamebooks.<br/><br/>In Britain the market leader was "Fighting Fantasy," by a long chalk, with "Lone Wolf" also very popular and a whole host of other solo lines (covering everything from Asterix the Gaul to escaping from WWII prisoner of war camps) making up the rest of the market; and of course there were the "Tunnels &amp; Trolls" solo adventures that started the whole thing off, printed over here under licence by Chris Harvey and later repackaged by Corgi when the whole gamebook thing became so insanely huge.<br/><br/>But CYOA...? They were a fairly minor presence on the shelves and gamers seemed to dislike their simplicity. Solo gamebooks do generally seem to have been more of a success here than in America (probably not in terms of actual units sold, but they appear to have had a larger impact and longer life) and I wonder whether they were seen less as a stepping-stone than the simpler CYOA books might have been.<br/><br/>For my part, with no local stores carrying "proper" RPGs and wargames at the time, buying a copy of "The Warlock of Firetop Mountain" changed my life.

The title <i>Sugarcane Island</i> does sound familiar, but mainly I remember an Old West adventure that frequently resulted in death by quicksand. They didn't really compare to RPGs in terms of interactivity but they had some advantages in terms of narrative coherence. Thus, you started to see a convergence, with gamebooks that had simple RPG-style mechanics (<i>Fighting Fantasy</i>) and RPG-like boardgames that used paragraph lookups (<i>Barbarian Prince</i>, <i>Voyage of the BSM Pandora</i>). Sometimes the paragraph subsystem would "take over" for several iterations of lookups and ad-hoc dicerolls, before you were dumped back out into the main game procedures. Finally there were the "solo adventures" (many of them by Flying Buffalo for T&amp;T, or Metagaming for <i>The Fantasy Trip</i>) which used full-blown RPG mechanics inside a paragraph system. Many of these were very good, and I spent a lot of time playing them.<br/><br/>One of the least successful approaches I saw was in a solo adventure called "Vagabond Thief!" in Metagaming's house organ, <i>Interplay</i> <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. It was very short but it claimed to avoid the artificiality of giving players a menu of possible actions at the end of each paragraph. The method: you were supposed to write an exhaustive, ordered list, of everything you <i>might</i> do, then check somewhere else to see if anything on the list triggers an event. (It's possible that I'm misremembering and you were offered a few "default" options to select from if you didn't want to go to the trouble, or nothing you thought of turned out to matter.)<br/><br/>Of course these games were also pretty similiar to the text-based "adventure" games, including <i>Adventure</i> and my favorite, <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>. The latter is really a wonderful adaptatation of the HhGttG story into game form. Probably not playable without having read the book or listened to the radio version, but since Doug Adams himself wrote the text, there are a lot of witty elements that take advantage of the unique form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71908/#Comment_71908" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T15:12:06+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  3:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2007 3:13PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a solo adventure in my edition of GURPS.

TSR published a few of these--the "Endless Quest" stuff, and I read them at age 7 in 1983.  Around that time, they started the Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon.  Two years later, they published Red Box Basic D&amp;D--which my friends and I played at a sleepover following the elementary school barn dance.  So, these types of books led directly to playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons--but that was, of course, <i>entirely</i> by design.<br/><br/>I read a bunch of these--the Endless Quest series, the largely inferior Choose Your Own Adventure, one stupid thing involving the "A" Team (where all the choices were written in assertive third person, rather than conditional second-person, so that I didn't understand they were meant to be choices), a couple of Conan books including one written by Gygax, and the terrific Lone Wolf books where I cheated like a mofo.<br/><br/>What I remember is that in Endless Quest <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, in the first few pages there is a "basilisk," presented as the major enemy.  "Basilisk" was a word neither I nor my mother had ever seen before.  As I recall, it wasn't even in our American Heritage Dictionary.  The closest my mother could think of was "monolith," so I had no idea what the hell the book was about.<br/><br/>Also, several of the books involved an "elven" prince.  I knew what an elf was, but I had no frickin' clue what this word "elven" was all about.  I kept thinking it was a typo for "eleven."  So, I'm like, "Hey, my guy is an eleven year old prince running around killing things, that's great to know I have something to look forward to in a couple years!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71987/#Comment_71987" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T14:01:36+00:00" title="May 26, 2007  2:01PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>This amuses me for strange reasons.

You quickly learn that these things have way too many cheap-ass "BANG! The End." results, and starting the book over from the beginning every time this happens sucks, so you learn to back-navigate through several tiers of choices.<br/><br/>Has anybody pointed out that Red Box Dungeons &amp; Dragons (c. 1983) started off with "programmed adventures" for tutorials?

Hence why I ceased playing it about the same time I ceased reading CYOA books. Oh, I like a good tactical challenge as much as the next guy. But that's why I play Warhammer 40K and other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Jason points out, the Steve Jackson Metagames modules seem to be the first of this breed. In fact, I learned to play RPGs with Death Test, as it happens in 1978 (selling on eBay for $25 now, apparently: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/OEJ-NM-Unpunched-The-Fantasy-Trip-Death-Test-Adventure_W0QQitemZ220116609283QQihZ012QQcategoryZ44111QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/OEJ-NM-Unpunched-The-Fantasy-Trip-Death-Test-Adventure_W0QQitemZ220116609283QQihZ012QQcategoryZ44111QQcmdZViewItem</a>).

I know I have Security Station, I just ran through it (sans the mechanics) just to check the design out a little while back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe T&amp;T; Solo adventures came out in '75 or '76. I think a strong argument could be made that CYOA books came from RPGs.
