How about dense, allusive, hermetic comics that read more like poetry than prose? How about comics loaded with multiple, prismatic meanings and possibilities? Comics composed like music? In a marketplace dominated by \u2018left brain\u2019 books, I thought it might be refreshing to offer an unashamedly \u2018right brain\u2019 alternative. </blockquote>\nSo I thought, "why not try to write an rpg that reads like a poem? Or a collection of poems that you can play, or something." Poems are not a good medium for communicating procedures (except very blatantly), but it might be fun. So I did.<br/><br/>It's called <a href="http://virtuerpg.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtue</a>, and it's an rip-off/homage/poem of the Ultima computer games from way back when. It's not finished, but it's a good skeleton so far.<br/><br/>I'd love to have some folks guess at what the game mechanics are. I'm also looking for general feedback, and wondering if anyone's tried something similar before.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195596/#Comment_195596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T07:24:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  7:24AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat idea.  When I think about a poem, I don't expect it to give me tangible information, which is what I would expect from game rules.  Because poetry is so much about interpretation and mis-interpretation, seems like it would be a struggle to write a set of rules using it.  To be specific about your game, I'm not really sure I understand how you actually play it.  Is the final result of the game a poem itself?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a game called Rengu for the Genre Redesign Contest, where the goal is to create a poem.  It's not a very good game, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195637/#Comment_195637" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T11:04:30+00:00" title="March  5, 2009 11:04AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poetry is the mode of <i>delivery</i> for the game, which I hope will encourage a somewhat different feel in play, but the result of playing Virtue isn't necessarily a poem.

Hmmm. actually the third choice<br/>is called "dark times", to not be confused with the "Curse" ability, which i'll describe later.<br/>i don't know how the three states are navigated between. perhaps randomly, or another player chooses for your character?<br/><br/>anyway, regardless of state, one player creates a scenario. (this could be the player of the protagonist, or another player) two non-protagonist<br/>players invent choices that the protagonist might make - "right" choices, or "wrong" choices, depending on what state the protagonist is in.<br/>the right/wrong designation is placed on the choices by the players making up the choices, based on the protagonist's moral code. yes?<br/><br/>so, the protagonist player makes a choice, and somehow gathers or loses virtue points. <br/><br/>when dealing with minor characters, protagonists are told their virtue score. virtue is tricky because if you make a lot of<br/>good choices in life but a few more bad choices, you'll have a low virtue, whereas if you don't really do anything at all then<br/>your virtue might well be high. <br/>&amp; it's further complicated by minor characters with, you know, bad judgment in some areas but whom are beloved to other minor<br/>characters with high virtue. ha!<br/><br/>the virtue that we gain helps us interact with minor characters, appear trustworthy etc.<br/>the endgame uses a different mechanic, however, a further extrapolation wherein first you use the Virtue points that you've gathered<br/>to impart lessons onto your character's children... and depending on how things work out (mechanics gap, here) your kids<br/>will become virtuous or not, and you will be happy or not as a result.<br/><br/>the second to last paragraph states that anything of mechanical value in this game hinges on the <br/>Virtue points that you've gathered. No swords +2 or "i have a good relationship with my father 2d8"<br/><br/><br/>ok, help me fill in the gaps, people!<br/><br/>thanks for the fun puzzle, Colin! I've never played the Ultima series, but i like your poem a lot. <br/><br/>awesome idea!<br/><br/><br/>edit: forgot to mention the curse thing. works just like in 4e.<br/><br/>kidding.<br/><br/>SO, there is some other weird way of figuring out which state your character is in, not just someone else picking which.<br/>&amp; when it's a dark time for your character, you must curse the world in your grief- make a statement about the world changing<br/>for the worse, which cannot be undone over the course of the game. a death, the break in a friendship, house fire, whatever.<br/><br/>cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
