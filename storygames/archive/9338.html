Should that given time be insufficient, then that <i>may</i> result in a failure if subsequent re-rolls don't make the attempted act go faster. In other words...<br/><br/>"The time bomb reads 20 seconds and it's counting down.<br/>"Okay! I'm disarming it."<br/>*Roll*<br/>"You succeed and it takes you 18 seconds to do it. Phew!"<br/><br/>or an alternate scenario:<br/><br/>"I'm hacking into the mainframe."<br/>"The security bots are going to be here to break down the door in 3 minutes."<br/>*Roll*<br/>"Crap. It's going to take me an hour just to break through the firewall!"<br/>"Okay, one minute passes. Make another roll."<br/>*Roll*<br/>"Sweet, I shaved off a good chunk of time. Now it's only going to take me... 30 minutes."<br/>"Another minute passes. You only have one more chance at this."<br/>*Roll*<br/>"YES! I managed to break into the mainframe and call off the bots with only 30 seconds to spare."<br/><br/>I imagine this would be applicable to some kind of game where high-pressure time bomb disarmament scenarios are pretty common.

A time bomb going off in your character's face while you're trying to disarm it is realistic, but not fictionalistic, and I'm all about the fictionalism.<br/><br/>Here's my sketch in the current state of the Pentasystem, where you can always win if you really want to by, in effect, borrowing current success with future grief (any resemblance to recent world economic systems is purely coincidental). As a background, "paths" are a series of things that need to be fulfilled in the fiction and then, when complete, yield both positive and negative consequences which you store up as you go:\n<blockquote>One of the great sources of suspense in many adventure stories is the countdown or race against the clock. The James Bond movies have sometimes taken this particular plot device to its extreme. This is easily implemented in a path context, as follows.<br/><br/>Set up a "doomsday clock". This can be a bowl of tokens, a die showing a particular number, a strip of paper with increments marked along which you move a marker, or even an actual clock (or a toy clock) which isn't running but which allows the time shown on it to be adjusted.<br/><br/>When writing the conditions (the steps of the path), include their effect on the doomsday clock. Success in fulfilling a condition may move the doomsday clock back (adding to the number of tokens, for example), it may leave it unaffected, or it may move it forward but by a smaller amount than failure. Failure at fulfilling a condition should always move the doomsday clock forward, towards the undesirable outcome. It's then up to you to narrate whatever time-limited, suspenseful circumstances seem appropriate.<br/><br/>The simplest scenario, and the most like a novel or movie, is that there are a given number of conditions to be fulfilled, and each moves the doomsday clock forward one increment, whether the characters succeed or fail (but more than one if they fail); the number of increments is only one or two more than the number of conditions. You can quickly reach a situation where failure isn't an option. If the characters fail at fulfilling a condition, they just need to sacrifice more or introduce more resources until they succeed. Meanwhile, they're aware that doom is getting closer and closer, but \u2013 by pulling out extraordinary sacrifices or by great good luck \u2013 they are just able to avert it in the nick of time.<br/>A fun variation is to have some of the conditions set off additional challenges when fulfilled, thus ramping up the tension.</blockquote>\nFred Hicks' little 2-pager with the doomsday clock, I forget its name, was the main inspiration here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206981/#Comment_206981" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T17:22:34+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  5:22PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2009 5:23PM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is Lacuna. It's slightly different from what you're talking about, but you get to roll again if you fail, but the number you roll gets added to a total.<br/><br/>Imagine a game, like Lacuna, where the number you roll gets added to a clock. And you can roll again if you fail, but it adds to the clock again.
