Like making a "rules lawyer" class or something like that.<br/></blockquote>\nRight. Cause if you want that, just play Munchkin. It already does that as well as need be done. (My 9 year old niece played Zombie Munckhin recently and loved it. Hilarious. I think she almost won, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383615/#Comment_383615" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T13:57:29+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  1:57PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2012 1:58PM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Munchkin's good by itself. It allows you to have a fun dungeon crawl. I think a Hackmaster Game is about using obscure (imaginary) rules for authority to give your protagonist (or the GM using them to provide the antagonist) with unique and goofy methods of solving or creating problems. That's what the Hackmaster Comics are mostly about. Of course, by "rules" here, I also include setting elements that have encoded scores. Certain qualities and conditions are inherently written in to classic old school games, but being able to make those up on the fly to fit the story you want to tell might be fun.<br/><br/>Taking a look at it from a 1000 Blank White Cards perspective, it could be something where you can introduce a setting element and others get to tack on rules that will help them OR introduce a rule that helps you in a given situation and others can tag setting elements on to that. (Setting elements being: a piece of equipment you carry, a monster you're facing, a class of NPC, a kind of substance or environmental condition in the game world...)<br/><br/>But that leaves the problem of motivation. What are the players trying to acheive? Ideally, it should also be a combination: a player stance + a game world change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383901/#Comment_383901" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T13:48:53+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  1:48PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if you can use rail roading as a mechanic? The GM and players could set up some specific plot rails during character/campaign creation and the players could get bonuses from following the rails but build up personal power from defying them. "The players must agree to help rescue the princess," for example is a common plot rail as is "No true adventurer would pry the wishing ring from the nose of the Healing Gawdess."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
