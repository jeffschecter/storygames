Not needing any at all is very unusual, but not strictly speaking impossible. It is more likely that the designer is making an error in design practices if they don't playtest at all, though. (Or they're not attempting to achieve a finished product in the traditional sense, which is of course fine - it's cool to write up some ideas and distribute them for others even if you don't feel like playing with them yourself right now, as Dirk says.)<br/><br/>To be more specific, here are the major kinds of playtesting that rpg design often uses, with the names I tend to use for them:<br/><br/><b>Explorative</b> playtest is when you have some ideas for a game and glue them quickly together to give them a whirl in real conditions, and brainstorm with the group on the flight to see whether there might be something interesting there. Later on you use explorative playtesting to expand upon concepts and explore their implications.<br/><br/><b>Focus group</b> testing is when you expose your game to some players in hopes of gleaning insight into how the players engage the material - how it is working for them in real conditions, and how it is failing them. The "focus group" is there in the name to emphasize the subjective nature of the creator-receptor encounter; the results you get are heavily influenced by the kind of person you use to test, which should be accounted for in designing the test.<br/><br/><b>Affirmative</b> testing or <b>stress</b> testing is when you have an ostensibly finished thing, and you put it through its paces to make sure everything works and you didn't forget to write up that equipment list or whatever.<br/><br/>Theoretically you can get by without any of these playtest types, because playtesting is a development tool, not an inherent part of what constitutes the finished game. In practice most designers tend to use playtesting, and how much and what type depends on the nature of the game as well as the nature of the designer. For example, one of my games was tested two times before I accepted it for its first publication, because those tests were successful as focus group testing and stress testing, leaving me with no doubts as to the quality of the product. In another project I organized three dozen sessions of playtests, including two small campaigns and some independent testing, because the nature of the game required a lot of explorative testing to hone the details, and a modicum of stress testing to make sure everything was working together the way it was supposed to. In both cases I stopped testing because I was finished, not because I was following a best practices guideline for the amount of playtesting you need to be a good person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452495/#Comment_452495" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T08:50:31+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  8:50AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2016 8:51AM by Rafu.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting distinction, Eero! So, personally speaking, exploratory playtesting is an integral part of my design process and the most fun \u2014 though, curiously, little to no such testing was involved in designing <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sitodirafu/Home/i-miei-giochi/enter-the-avenger" rel="nofollow">Enter the Avenger</a> and all following testing became <i>confirmatory</i> (it convinced me that the game as first written was finished, and a good game). Also, I've taken flak from my fellow Italian role-players/designers on occasion for my radical opinion that you <b>can't</b> really stress-test role-playing games, the way you would stress-test other kinds of games.<br/><br/>But enough of a tangent\u2026<br/><br/>I think it bears mention that, for a long time, playtesting wasn't the norm, or even at all expected, in RPGs. Some publications did result from the author's ongoing campaign(s), and were thus incidentally playtested, and D&amp;D tournament-style modules were of course tested on the field, but AFAIK at least in the 1990s most role-playing books were created entirely as <i>writing</i> assignments \u2014 RPG companies didn't employ any "department of playtesting".<br/>There was a bit of a change with D&amp;D3e, I think, possibly reflecting ingrained habits from working on Magic: the Gathering? I believe some playtesting was involved in the initial development of 3e, and I do remember this being touted as a feature at the time. But this was reversed almost immediately, with the first batch of obviously unplaytested "splatbooks". All in all, I think the development of D&amp;D remained playtest-driven, but more as a sort of post-publication debugging thing which resulted in new editions \u2014 not unlike in software development.<br/><br/>Concurrently, it was of course on the Forge that people started pushing playtesting as such an important part of RPG development, including a habit of crediting playtesters (which I do subscribe to). In fact, there was a time when "needs more playtesting" had become a buzzword, a code for "put more effort into it", "don't publish yet" or even "I don't care about your game if it's not a product of the culture and scene I'm part of", which I believe was what prompted Ben Lehman to write his infamous anti-playtest rant ("playtesting is not a substitute for design" or something like that). Our community, for a time, had turned "playtesting" into a barrier to entry.<br/><br/>But maybe, the author of the game mentioned in the OP isn't from that crowd. Maybe they're from a background where RPGs <i>aren't</i> usually playtested prior to publishing, as was the case for a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452497/#Comment_452497" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T09:04:08+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  9:04AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very good, Rafu - the historical perspective is interesting. You're probably right about playtesting not having been a formal part of the thinking in the traditional times, which is amazing in itself to think about from the current perspective. Without knowing about the behind the scenes on many individual game projects, I can totally believe that their playtesting was organic (meaning, it was incidental and not a mandated part of the workflow). Something like say Rolemaster or such. Runequest, I explicitly know got a large amount of what amounts to playtesting, but it was the exact sort you mention - the game was developed via exploratory playtesting. And of course we all know how little playtesting your average TSR book would have - or any books from an actually corporate '80s or '90s publisher.<br/><br/>I guess that the playtesting thing is just one of those things I, among others, picked up at the Forge. There are all these little cornerstones of how to go about things that I learned there. Wonderful, really.<br/><br/>Regarding exploratory playtesting, I've found that it's become a big part of my design work as well. Early on I wouldn't do it as much (e.g. ten years ago, when I wrote a lot of small and tight games, I would go directly to focus group testing or confirmatory testing), but nowadays I tend to favour a quick alpha playtest draft taken to the table soon as possible, with more consideration put into it once we get some internal insight into how the thing plays. Sort of similar to the light-weight software design paradigms that have become more common nowadays.<br/><br/>But then again, thinking about it, I did write <a href="http://www.arkkikivi.net/julkaisut/julenius" rel="nofollow">Fellows of the Julenius Archive</a> with a single focus group test and a single confirmatory test session not too far back. Definitely possible to go direct from drafting to product development for the right kind of (small) game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452500/#Comment_452500" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T12:56:13+00:00" title="April 22, 2016 12:56PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I now give myself at least two years to playest something, and I do it in the context of running at least one actual campaign over that time (in addition to isolated playtests of specific mechanics). I've found that to be incredibly important, especially since I want the games playable over the long haul. Things come up during the course of regular play that shed different light things than when you are just doing isolated playtests (i.e. something that seems like it isn't enjoyable or potentially unbalanced if run as a single isolate encounter or as part of a single session, might be less of a problem-or more of a problem-in the context of a full campaign). You also find way more holes in the game that way. <br/><br/>I think game companies with more time to devote on a daily basis to play testing can achieve that in a much shorter span of time of course.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452501/#Comment_452501" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T13:09:58+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  1:09PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Concurrently, it was of course on the Forge that people started pushing playtesting as such an important part of RPG development, including a habit of crediting playtesters (which I do subscribe to).

I've seen play tester credits in books well before the forge came around. Playtesting too has been around well before then. Things we certainly imperfect at TSR during Loraine Williams tenure but even the 2E players handbook mentions play testing several times in the introduction section. I've heard differing accounts, but to me it sounds like play testing, even if Williams did discourage it, was something designers wanted to do and often did on their own time. Importantly, people reacted strongly against her position against play testing, which to me suggests play testing was a thing that was valued by designers. Based on what I've read of the development of D&amp;D, and what people who were there have said, that was clearly play tested. Having grown up in the 80s, I can also say a lot of games looked like they didn't get the play testing they should have, but that is true today as well. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452503/#Comment_452503" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T13:56:58+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  1:56PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal benchmark is "do you hate it yet?

Don't let anybody tell you how to make things you love, but understand that if you are not diligent in putting out a complete and reasonably cogent game that will be a reflection on you in the future. Take pride in your work and strive to make it Pretty Good. You can't do that without playtesting, so figure out what makes sense to you. I know really smart game designers who playtest very minimally and others who have rigorous methodologies. <br/><br/>I'm actually OK with playtesting being a modest barrier to entry. Finding people who trust and care enough to make a large sacrifice in time and energy on your project speaks well of your social and organizational skills, and it probably means you are reciprocating by playtesting for others, which makes you a better designer. Obviously there are cases where the barrier may be systemic and that's another issue, but if you are just Some Random Dude who can't find anyone to playtest your game, maybe look closer at why that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452522/#Comment_452522" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T21:17:36+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  9:17PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2016 9:39PM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My personal benchmark is "do you hate it yet?

It sounds like you're saying if you can't find playtesters for your games you've obviously got a problem with your social skills. There are all sorts of reasons why requests to playtest games get declined - time constraints, a general apprehensiveness about trying something new, comfort zone issues, preference for other types of games (this is the problem I usually face, as most of the folks I game with regularly are very reluctant to try indie games).<br/><br/>And I get the point about random dudes popping up on forums trying to recruit playtesters, but as a fellow designer I try to cut them some slack since I think it's likely they've tried to find playtesters locally or on other forums but for whatever reason (and not necessarily to do with their poor social skills) have failed to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452525/#Comment_452525" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T22:15:59+00:00" title="April 22, 2016 10:15PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Jason's point is a realistic one:<br/><br/>If you can't find playtesters for you game, you're unlikely to ever sell it to people.<br/><br/>That might be a question of your social and marketing skills, or it might be a question of no one being interested in your subject material, but both are relevant to marketing a game.<br/><br/>If you're a designer and you're trying to get a game out there, this is an important and realistic concern.

Like, design for a smaller social footprint (or maybe just a more fitting one); design shorter (or maybe longer!) games, for fewer (or more!) players, and so on. That is, by designing a more easily playable game you're also, as an immediate benefit, making it a more eminently <i>playtest-able</i> game.<br/>By "more fitting" social footprint (rather than just a smaller one) I mean: target your design at real people \u2014 <i>specific</i> people you might play with. That's always a good idea regardless.<br/><br/>However, there's also in my opinion a fuzzy line past which "playtesting" does turn into a marketing antic. And should we arbitrarily be setting this bar too high, we'd end up silencing some minority voices: social capital notwithstanding, to thoroughly playtest a game is first and foremost a significant investment of time, and time is a rare, valuable commodity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452535/#Comment_452535" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T00:53:30+00:00" title="April 23, 2016 12:53AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True!<br/><br/>But there's a big difference between convincing people you already know and trust to play a game with you - and convincing strangers on the internet (or wherever) to try your game.

Case in point: I\u2019ve been lugging round an offbeat game about modern families for nearly four years, and trying with minimal success to get playtesters for it.

This is <i>much</i> less important than playing the game yourself; it takes having some support skills (e.g. human insight, wide experience with different play situations), but it is well in the realm of possibility to do all the necessary playtesting yourself for many types of gaming products. Not saying that independent testing isn't valuable in its time and place, but it's not <i>crucial</i>. And if somebody cannot find the time nor the players to play the game with them, I don't think that concerns about product quality are really timely for the project; a game you cannot even play yourself surely isn't ready to become any sort of publication. Whatever it is that prevents you from playtesting your game, fix that first. Lacking the players to play your game with you is like lacking the pen and paper to write your game up; it is a fundamental lack in the working environment.<br/><br/>(A free hint: one should not prioritize becoming a game <i>designer</i> without being a successful game <i>player</i> first, just like you have to be a reader to be a writer. In the realm of social gaming, which tabletop rpgs definitely are, this means having friends who want to play with you, and are willing to play a wide variety of games with you, including your own designs. Work on that first if it's a bottleneck, for it will surely be the best possible move you can make in improving your game design.)<br/><br/>An armchair designer who does not intend to play his own game at all, perhaps because they're not that interested in gaming, would probably be better off with some other type of creative hobby. I have no confidence in rpg writing being able to give them creative satisfaction, given how esoteric a creative field it is; actual play is what gives rpg design purpose, and if you are yourself cut off from that hobby, then there is little reason for you to design.<br/><br/>(The above obviously does not apply to showpiece designs that are not intended for play, but rather for other designers to read and cogitate for amusement or theoretical insight or whatever. It's a very specific field of creative writing, but worthwhile when you have something interesting to say, and want to say it in the form of a song - or a game, in this case.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452563/#Comment_452563" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T19:22:50+00:00" title="April 23, 2016  7:22PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2016 7:51PM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When we're talking about "finding playtesters", the issue is usually finding people to do independent testing - strangers who will play your game without you being there to run it for them.

The point of external playtesting to is to winkle out bugs that would prevent people from buying a game when it's finally published. Once it's out there it's too late to fix them, and people will let you know - very loudly - why your game sucks. Alpha playesting (for want of a better descriptor), is very important, and yes you can't advance as a designer without playing your own games, but the problem with confining yourself to playing them with people you know is that, while you'll probably be able to set the rules that way, you won't necessarily get the kind of honest criticism you need from those players and, as I say, by the time the book's on the shelves it's way too late. <br/><br/>It's also a matter of numbers. People's local audiences differ widely of course, but they\u2019re unlikely to be large. In my own case, I can count on around a dozen people at most, and that's if they're interested in the game - if they aren't, they'll find ways of getting out of playtesting it while still being outwardly supportive. If we widen that circle to include cons and other large-scale gamer gatherings, the number rises, obviously, but it\u2019s still measured in dozens rather than hundreds, however for your game to succeeded in the marketplace you need hundreds of people buying it, and it\u2019s <i>these</i> people who need to be playtesting it, <i>before</i> it goes on sale, and (probably) unlike your local audience, they will be ruthless in their analysis, so I\u2019d say they\u2019re pretty crucial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452565/#Comment_452565" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T19:52:36+00:00" title="April 23, 2016  7:52PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2016 7:53PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True!<br/><br/>I read Eero's post as taking a step earlier than that, though.

I would expect most everybody to agree that actually having a gaming life yourself is the first precept, and everything else, including external playtesting, comes after that.)<br/><br/>The point I was making was that usually, when people ask about finding playtesters, and usually, when playtesting becomes a major hurdle for game development, it is external, independent playtesting that is at an issue; it is much rarer for somebody to have the problem of being completely unable to play their game themselves. It is good to differentiate which case we're talking about, and have some perspective on the importance of the problem.<br/><br/>This is an important distinction exactly because of what I said: external playtesting is important, but it is not <i>mandatory</i>, and for some projects not even among the top issues. While I don't think that it is possible to over-emphasize the importance of playing your game yourself, I do think that it is possible to over-emphasize the need for external playtesting. As has been said by others here, the emphasis on playtesting as a best practice can become a blind doctrine more useful to excluding people than it is for designers trying to improve their work. The remedy to that is to actually understand how important playtesting is, and why, and where, instead of blindly singing its praises. It is <i>useful</i> and one of the few tools that give you the benefits it does, but it is not <i>everything</i>.<br/><br/>For the record, I have authored, published and sold games successfully with insignificant external playtesting. (<i>Zombie Cinema</i>, to be specific, went through its convoluted and thorough development cycle with external playtesting playing a very minor role; I have no doubts about the quality of the final product.) I have also refused to move forward on projects before arranging for sufficient independent testing. The usefulness depends on what precisely is going on in your design, the necessity for independent testing is not somehow in-built into the nature of what it is to craft a game. The same or similar information may well exist for you already, to pick just one example of a reason that might reduce the necessity for external testing. Or your design might be largely conservative and consist mostly of non-interactive elements with low chance of emergent behaviours. Or the whole point of the work might be the sharing of personal experience; I definitely know that my prospective book about how <b><i>I</i></b> play old school D&amp;D would not have any external playtesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452574/#Comment_452574" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T21:00:55+00:00" title="April 23, 2016  9:00PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2016 9:26PM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Lots of games are published and do well without it; therefore, it can't be said to be fundamental - from a practical point of view.<br/><br/>Kind of like a seatbelt not being a "requirement" for a functional car.</blockquote>\nDangerous though! If you send it out into the world and serious bugs get picked up after it's out there, you're finished. When my gamer buddies and I have discussions about published games they don't rate very highly, the comment I hear most frequently is 'I don't think they playtested this enough'. So yes, I'm sure there are many games out there (particularly rules light, low page count story games) that <i>could</i> be published without external playtesting, and perhaps some have, but it's a big risk IMO and, whatever the probabilities, I just know that if I drive into a tree, the car I'm in won't have a seat belt <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/>.<br/><br/>I'm tempted to shake up the playtesting alphabet even further, and say... dare I say it?

It is <i>not</i> the fault of the playtesting if a game with a legitimate audience does not work well for somebody looking for something entirely different. Casting doubt on the seriousness, cognitive competence or, above all, conscientiousness of the designer is easy and fun if you're a nasty critic bent on expressing how very much you loathe a game. However, no amount of playtesting will turn a fish into a bicycle, for playtesting can only make a thing more like itself (approach its Platonic ideal, as I like to say), not solve problems that somebody has with the entire concept of the work.<br/><br/>Again, a realistic perspective is the best. Just like we don't worship the Sun unreservedly despite it being very, very important to life on Earth, we do not need to worship playtesting. Particularly, we do not need to elevate it into an official standard that <i>defines</i> quality; if the lack of playtest causes an impact on the quality of a work, that is one thing (and useful for a designer to realize), while claiming that the mere lack of playtest <i>is</i> the lack of quality - that's worship of the golden calf <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452638/#Comment_452638" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-25T20:20:08+00:00" title="April 25, 2016  8:20PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2016 9:05PM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was very careful about the way I characterized the importance of local vs. independent playtesting.</blockquote>\nAnd I completely understood it: the former is essential; the latter, while important, isn't. I disagreed for the reasons stated previously, to whit independent playtesters, due to their ability and willingness to give honest feedback (which with the best will in the world your gamer buddies aren't, or at least can't be relied on to) are a crucial bridge between you and your eventual market. I'm happy to believe that you've designed games that have gone out without independent testing and have been successful, but, as Paul_T implies with his seat belt analogy, it's hella risky. <br/><br/>But I suspect our variance on this matter is impervious to continued debate, so to take another point, I think I may be misunderstanding one of the terms being used in this and related threads (hehe yes, what are the chances of that?), viz 'playing one's own games'. I always assumed this meant running ones own games, but now I realise it means <i>playing</i> them, with a member of your playtest group in the chair. Is that correct? If so, I think we need some new terms; in any case, the Alpha/Beta distinction, which makes sense for CRPGs, is perhaps not so relevant when discussing TTRPGs, so let me suggest a sort of pipeline including one that I don't think has been mentioned so far (Stage 4), as follows:<br/><br/>Stage 1 Running your game for your local group.<br/>Stage 2 Playing your game, with another member of your playtest group running it.<br/>Stage 3 Running it for a group of independent playtesters.<br/>Stage 4 A member of your playtest group running it for independent playtesters. <br/>Stage 5 An independent playtester running it for independent playtesters.\n<blockquote>claiming that the mere lack of playtest is the lack of quality</blockquote>I'm not claiming that, I'm saying that a lack of external playtesting could have a disastrous effect on eventual sales <i>if</i> there are any bugs that don't get picked up earlier because your friends were too polite to point them out.\n<blockquote>Does "bypassing the local audience" mean you never play your own game, yourself?

If you put up an obscure games for free that uses a new system or system that people aren't familiar with, it is probably more of an uphill climb (still I could see the right game catching a wave if it were free). I think you assume a certain amount of attrition, but the proof would be in how many responses you get to your requests for feedback (if this is being done as a playtest).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452732/#Comment_452732" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-28T08:06:22+00:00" title="April 28, 2016  8:06AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If they put up 5E for free, people would definitely download and play it.</blockquote>\nA huge number of people would download it, a tiny fraction of those would actually read it all, and a tiny fraction of <i>those</i> would actually play it.

My point is that rule of thumb isn't going to hold up for every RPG. That formula would probably be correct for your average indie game, but we are talking about D&amp;D. I think it is safe to say, if they put it out for free, as a complete game but with an eye for play testing for bugs, they'd get more than a tiny fraction of the initial download era playing it. Heck they kind of did that already with their playtest sign ups when they were making 5E (and that had a bunch of hoops to jump through and was hardly a finished product). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452783/#Comment_452783" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T17:11:06+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  5:11PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>that had a bunch of hoops to jump through and was hardly a finished product). <br/></blockquote>\nI think that's the point:<br/><br/>It may be that presenting hoops to jump through (like paying for your product) helps you build investment, and means more of the people who DO get through will actually play the game.

My point is the hoops were more likely a deterrent (I know I almost didn't download it at first due to them). Free content is going to be recieved differently depending on the product and how much demand exists for it. If there are 1,000 tables eager to play a game and you make it available to them for free, do you really think that will deter them from playing it? I find it very difficult to imagine that if they put out 5E for free on RPGnow, it wouldn't get a ton of downloads and be used at peoples' tables. I certainly think what you say might apply to more indie games. I just don't think it is as simple as people are making it out to be.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452790/#Comment_452790" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T17:34:52+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  5:34PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could be!

I ran dozens of play tests with multiple GMs at a 3 day con, and got great feedback. Of course, you are limited to small adventures, so it is more a test of the general rule system than the xp  character generation etc.<br/><br/>I included all of the play tester's names on the staff page so they were right up front. This was way before the forge existed. Back in the 90s. Hey you have to reward players for putting up with a draft of a game.<br/><br/>Definitely get others to run your game. Running it yourself is great to fine tune character creation and the general mechanics. Having someone else run it tests the GM section, NPC generation, and other world related rules. I worked on a game for about 3 years so I knew every inch of the setting. A new GM came in and I realized there were things in the setting that made no sense and had to be clarified. There were also missing rules I had to add for encounter and adventure generation. <br/><br/>If you still want to be part of it just be a player and let someone else GM. Same effect. We did that before we went to the con so it helped iron out a bunch of bugs.<br/><br/>A campaign I would definitely run from beginning to end. Without that there is no way to tell if there is too much treasure or too little. There could be too many wandering monsters that cause the players to jump a level early making the rest of the adventure easy. I haven't created a campaign for d20 so not sure how you would run through it faster to just test it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce" title="soyosauce"><img alt="soyosauce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce">soyosauce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452860/#Comment_452860" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-02T16:18:43+00:00" title="May  2, 2016  4:18PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Paul_T it is demonstrably true. </blockquote>\nI think so, too.

For this to work the creative chemistry is of course paramount; if you are not actually interested in somebody else's project, it's probably too risky to put the required man-hours into the playtesting (or studio critique, or editing, or whatever it is they need - playtesting is just one thing you can do for others), and even if you do, they might be left completely cold by your next project later on in the cycle.<br/><br/>This is all long-term strategy - or rather lifestyle, it's not like I plan for future favours in advance. By approaching the scene with mutualism in mind, ready and willing to see friends and colleagues in interesting people, you'll be likely to find that over a couple of years you build up enough social capital to make independent playtesting quite achievable.<br/><br/>Of course all this is not much help if you need playtesting <i>now</i> and are stuck without external feedback. In that case the best bet is probably to really spruce that manuscript up, add candy to hook people's interest. Sort of like a practice run for the actual publication; if you can't attract any playtest heat, that might be saying something about how much other people are intrigued by the premise of you game in the first place. The logical extreme for this is, of course, an ashcan publication (a public beta release, if you will).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452876/#Comment_452876" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T08:07:33+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  8:07AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2016 8:08AM by Rickard.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't have to playtest.

Just kind of a bummer to not get any feedback as well. Kyle prepared me for it as well and it STILL bummed me out hard. There has been one or two, though. That's been great to begin a dialogue with them at least! As someone who only began doing any social media at all because of the kickstarter, the most exciting thing for me was hearing what people thought. Good and bad, even if the bad is discouraging. Totally makes sense that you first present them with the finished product and then they judge it. Just underestimated the amount of people backing it vs how many of them would look at the materials in order to say what they thought. Seems so weird to not talk about stuff you liked or disliked about what you're seeing when you already have money invested in the outcome though?

the time, but then never getting down to writing reports. As for game-texts which people send me for just a reading review, well\u2026 I usually try and read them, but then I don't usually get as far as writing detailed feedback \u2014 especially when I think I have some <i>negative</i> feedback to give, then it's a huge hurdle to actually write it. I mean, that's something I would have managed to do in my university student days, but now I'm simply too tired when I get to be sitting at my computer for an hour a day or so.<br/><br/>That's why I really appreciated that sharing reviews became part of Game Chef, by the way!

Seems like it'd be neat to see some stuff tweaked, removed, added, etc. But I get the hurdle. In the end I'm grateful it's funded AT ALL, wasn't sure people would be down for my "version" of cyberpunk. <br/><br/>It's too bad because giving negative feedback could remove the stuff that you think doesn't work, when you go to review the finished product. Probably some people assume you don't want feedback, too. I've given feedback just on some PbTA, G+ communities -where they say they want feedback but it's clear after you've given it that they would rather hear what does work and not what doesn't for you. So maybe after a couple times of that people just don't bother, which makes sense. But is sad.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453039/#Comment_453039" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T17:57:18+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  5:57PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it depends on how you deal with what playtesters say. I had a lot of good positive and negative feedback at rpgnet. I just posted the pdf and got everyone's general feel and answered questions. The feedback actually lead to some rule rewrites. This was good on just the general nuts and bolts of what they saw when they read it. It was helpful to know the impression our work was getting across. Feedback seemed to dry up as soon as we defended some ideas. Might be better to just take it all and tell them you'll talk more about the choices later. <br/><br/>We ran adventures at cons and then asked for opinions. Some groups we took through character gen and others we gave out characters and so we got some decent feedback on gameplay and character generation. The feedback, again, lead to some rule changes since the consensus was the character gen had math that no one wanted to do.<br/><br/>I noticed some of the GMs who were not directly involved to the development of the game got much more feedback. So that may also be a factor that could help                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce" title="soyosauce"><img alt="soyosauce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce">soyosauce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453049/#Comment_453049" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-07T04:20:07+00:00" title="May  7, 2016  4:20AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm. That's pretty interesting! I'll try and keep that in mind when more feedback is offered. Could be a mistake in thinking the feedback is a dialogue. During playtesting I found some people would default to the "Can you justify this change" mode of thinking, which was pretty weird. I guess AW is pretty beloved but obviously it's going for something quite different. So it's not a justification it's me telling you the mechanics are different because this is a different game lol And when I explained, they took it to me "Defending" my position. Apparently we were in a duel of wits? Why would cyberpunk be that similar to AW...why should it be...why is it a justification. <br/><br/>As a whole, that's super helpful Chaiboy! Thanks for the insights. I suppose it would make sense too, that they'd want to give feedback to people not directly involved. Hopefully someone decides to run the Veil and record it or something so I can listen in to some people talking about it. I had reached out to some podcasts but most seem pretty well booked, but perhaps after the kickstarter is complete some people will run it and I'll get my chance.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453051/#Comment_453051" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-07T04:44:18+00:00" title="May  7, 2016  4:44AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Feedback seemed to dry up as soon as we defended some ideas.
