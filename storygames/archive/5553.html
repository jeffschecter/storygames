Then I told them, they've heard of a legendary treasure hidden in an undersea cave under a island just a few miles in the sea : the Crown of Poseidon. The cave appears during the great spring equinox tide that should take place in a few days.<br/><br/>In the village, Garlic (I've asked the players for an irish sounding name for the place... remember we are french...), the PCs find out that the young boys are taken away from the village for a few days and that the virgin girls are kept drugged in a cell. Every year, during the spring equinox night, the virgins of the village are sent to the Sons of the Goat God to ensure good crops for the next year. Their first child becomes then another son of the Goat God and is sent to the woods. That's why the village has turned away from the sea. Even if a lot of the people are descended from the ancient god Poseidon.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/map.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/><br/><br/>Instead of choosing between the treasure or killing the monsters, because the revel with the Goat God's Sons and the opening of the cave took place on the same night, the players decided to abduct the girls, take them to the treasure island and wait there for the goat monsters to fight them. See the doodles...<br/><br/>We had a hell of a fight where two of the PCs went down (no one died though) and the last two finished the two bosses with some clever Assist action.<br/><br/>After that they fought the monster garding the treasure (an giant octopus) and took the crown of Poseidon with them.<br/><br/>I think I overpowered my monsters a little in this game. I'll put them in the monsters thread as soon as I can. But overall, it was another great game of the RBH. Three of the players were new to the game and they loved it instantly : the classes, the talents, the awesome tokens system. The Assist action was the star of the game. They didn't use it at the beginning of the first fight and 2 PCs went down. The last 2 survived because they made great use of it. When they leveled up one player chose to cross-class and take the warrior talent of "Strategist". It was put to great use in the last fight.<br/><br/>I wanted to do some doodles, but instead I made some bad sketches (and I couldn't help but use some colors...). I'll do better next time, Eric.<br/><a href="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/1_petit.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><a href="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/2_petit.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><a href="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/3_petit.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><a href="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/4.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/4_petit.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><a href="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/5.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/5_petit.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><a href="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/6.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.ruedesbroussailles.com/telechargements/goat/6_petit.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Antoine<br/><br/>- Edited because English is not my langage...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124538/#Comment_124538" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T09:15:34+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  9:15AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Yay for flying fox archers!

I must admit that the different powers of the game are very wise and so original.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Eric : yes, I've choosen the power of three tails because thinking to have a roleplay more based on back up than being in frontline. And this power really deserve the role I was imagining. One of my best moment is when Jos\xe9phine was running (2 movements) with the Goat on her back and I was supporting her with assist to increase her power when she will decide to face the boss. Then when she did it, she was really overpowered and could slay him easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Three Tails is a great power for characters who like to assist the main fighter (except in caves :p) and the power Strategist appears to be really designed for to get specialized in that kind of play. I could only assist one time during the second big fight against the Octopus before I get hurt but I really saw the improvement it gives to Jean-Yves (Yari Master)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124586/#Comment_124586" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T11:51:37+00:00" title="February  5, 2008 11:51AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, yet another fantastic set of drawings! <br/>Am I the only RBH player working with stick figures?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124611/#Comment_124611" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T12:29:58+00:00" title="February  5, 2008 12:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2008 12:30PM by Mike_Sands.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anarchangel</cite>Am I the only RBH player working with stick figures?</blockquote>\nNo. And my stick figure doodles have been too crappy to share, so far.

Real life's busy these days...<br/><br/>Thank you all for the compliments. It's heartwarming. And thanks Guillaume for the nice comments on the game. I realy enjoyed myself and it was nice to play another time with you after perhaps 3 years... Like in the good old days.<br/><br/>About the monsters... I think I got my english wrong when I said I "overpowered" them. I meant that I had given them too many powers, making them too strong. It was the first time I had this many PCs at the table and I wanted my monsters to be real threats. So far I've had trouble making the monsters powerfull enough. I wanted them to be able to bring at least one PC at 0 HP.  And I never cheat on the dice. But in game, I realised that if I played them fully, I would kill all the PCs in a few rounds. After 2 rounds, I decided not to use at least one of the powers. I'll check that, when I'll put them in the monsters gallery.<br/><br/>Also, the PCs could survive because, against the last monster, the longrunner flew with the beast following her while the fox was doing Assist actions from the sky. When she was charged enough with tokens, she turned and killed it in one shot. But I made a mistake. My monster had a free move action and so could make 2 moves to catch the longrunner. I said to her that with the "two things at once" talent she could make 2 move actions too and so she could keep her distance. I remembered only after the game, that it was only 1 move action + another action. So she could not have done that. I realy think I've made my monsters too powerfull...<br/><br/>Still, it was a great game and I can't wait to play again.<br/>Now, all characters are at least 2nd level and one is 3rd level. They are a real threat !<br/><br/>Regarding the drawings. Don't be ashamed of your stick figures. It's what Eric realy asked for and I did some too. It's realy fun. It's just that I love to draw and I don't have that much time to do it those days. So when I do some visual actual play, it's realy tempting to do more than stick heroes... I realy had to stop myself before I made a real comics page with this game account. I decided to stop and post my sketches as they were. So : post your doodles !! Gambate !<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Antoine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124894/#Comment_124894" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T05:49:22+00:00" title="February  7, 2008  5:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>About the monsters...

Have you ever played a game with such important result of teamplaying? Usually RPG is giving teamplay of course but it sounds more like individuality behavior designed to work together, not one main character with others giving him bonus on his attack.<br/>\nWith RBH, I've really felt that the actions you are acting are influencing the scene. Now I have understood this primordial point of the game, I think that my actions are going to be more in that kind of result. Also "Strategist" will improve my role of "assistant".<br/>\nIf I have one thing to say, may be the designer of the game should insist more of this main specifity which is the assist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125290/#Comment_125290" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T15:38:49+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  3:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2008 3:39PM by Anarchangel.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe my monsters have been overly puny, but assists have never been used or needed in my game.

So he ended up using assists almost all the time (through a perceived lack of ability in direct attacks, although this might not have been as bad as he thought).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125346/#Comment_125346" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T21:26:38+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  9:26PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2008 9:27PM by Anarchangel.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll throw in some higher AC monsters on Monday, and see if it prompts some Assists.<br/><br/>Maybe the "problem" is that the high Eloquence Mystic has super-hot dice and thus pwns in direct attacks.
