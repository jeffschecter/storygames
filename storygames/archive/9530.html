I'm specifically looking for people who will play the game and provide feedback, not just read it.<br/><br/>What is Microscope? It's a no-prep, no-GM game. Very heavy on the big story, the collective creation--you don't even have your own character. Here's a pretty good description:\n<blockquote>You start with the big picture, the grand scheme of your history, then zoom in and explore all the nooks and crannies. The more you play, the more complex the history becomes. Your once simple summary becomes a detailed tapestry, full of meaning and surprises.<br/> <br/>\t\tIt\u2019s fractal gaming.<br/> <br/>\t\tWant to leap a thousand years in the future and see how an institution shaped society? Want to jump back to the childhood of the king you just saw assassinated and find out what made him such a hated ruler? That\u2019s normal play in microscope. You have the freedom to move around and examine whatever you want, defying limits of time and space.</blockquote>\nThis is actually version three of the rules. The first two versions were playtested by the brave and beautiful gamers of Seattle, but so far I've been always directly involved. Now it's time to see how the game does when I'm not sitting at the table -- y'know, a real playtest.<br/><br/>If you're interested, whisper me with your email address, or send an email to microscope-playtest + lamemage.com.<br/><br/>Got questions? Hit me.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks are also in order to everybody I've had so much fun playing the game with already: Tony Dowler, Ryan Dunleavy, Mike Frost, John Harper, Robert Haskell, Jem Lewis, Kevin Lewis, Ching-Ping Lin, Trey Marshall, and Paul Riddle, plus additional feedback from Stephen Scholz and Jonathan Walton.

My first reaction to the rules was pretty positive; I know from reading the dev. blogs on the project at Lame Mage that there was some initial diffculty in explaining the game's concept to others and I can safely say that in my experience that is not the case in this version.  The rules are clear, concise, and fairly intuitive.  I feel that going into a game I might need to refer to the rules for adjudication, but the overall concept was easy to grasp and certainly sounds fun.  When I had finished reading though I was definitely excited to play so in that regards it is a success.  I'll post initial reactions to actual play here as soon as I have them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/giullina" title="giullina"><img alt="giullina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nX18O567GCAJ6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/giullina">giullina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212805/#Comment_212805" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T03:11:27+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  3:11AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, a question:<br/>\nam I allowed to pass the pdf over to the other guys in the playtest group?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside: I've just browsed the game and whoa, it actually looks like the game I have been looking for for a long, long time.

I didn't think two would work at all, but I was wrong, it worked great (that was also our first stab at a real world alternate history Microscope game, a classic "what if the Nazi's won WWII" setting).<br/><br/>Personally I think four is ideal, because you have a good balance of constant involvement plus unexpected creative contributions. Three players is a close runner up. Then again I favor smaller groups in just about all games these days, so that just might be my bias.<br/><br/>There is at least one playtest group who's going to try playing over Skype, so we'll see how that goes. The history changes constantly, so there might be technical issues displaying that for all players. Instead of using a visual map of the history you could also just write it as a text outline, so that might be a good way to rapidly update and display the history online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JADettman" title="JADettman"><img alt="JADettman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JADettman">JADettman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213318/#Comment_213318" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T05:09:09+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  5:09AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it too late to get in on playtesting this?<br/><br/>I may not be able to get a group together until after Origins but I'd be interested in giving this a go.<br/><br/>best,<br/><br/>     --Jason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213508/#Comment_213508" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T15:21:47+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  3:21PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never too late Jason (insert Microscope "<a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/121/the-past-is-never-closed-and-other-data-storage-problems/" rel="nofollow">past is never closed</a>" joke here).

The clockwise, counter-clockwise rules don't apply and you have really be on your story-game toes because when you're not the current player or the Lens, you're about to be, but that's really good in a way. It's very intense. Because players have such broad creative powers in a scene and because the idea is that you're never advocating for "your" character but rather the story, having just two players doesn't mean there are only two characters affecting the scene which is why scenes don't feel limited to just a two-way conversation. So, while it's not ideal, if you don't think your whole gaming group would go for Microscope, you can definitely just give it a whirl with another person and I am sure it will work and be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213695/#Comment_213695" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T05:50:24+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  5:50AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished reading the rules last night, and can't wait to play.<br/><br/>I'm running it with <a href="http://themythweavers.com/" rel="nofollow">my Skype group</a>, and the same idea occurred to me that you mentioned: using the text outline and a real-time shared document.

That's a great premise for a Microscope history.<br/><br/>I agree with what you say in your blog post: five players is definitely the high end. It can work, but four is better (which is true for lots of story games). In hindsight, I think "three or more players" gives the totally wrong impression and I need to amend that.<br/><br/>It's better (I'd argue) to force people to choose a character, even if that character never appears on stage, because that choice can still contribute to the scene. We had some scenes at GPNW where the chief scientist was dealing with the corrupt council and a rogue AI, and in the very first scene his wife was a character, and her Revealed Thoughts were something like "I wish he would confide in me. I know something's bothering him." She never even walked into the scene, but it added another subtext to what was going on.<br/><br/>And if you do decide mid-scene that there's another character who would be really useful to move the scene, you can just control NPCs and introduce them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215552/#Comment_215552" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T16:04:52+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  4:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger, the focus can be anything the lens wants, whether that's something already in the game or something just made up.

And several characters reincarnations and decedents showing up latter in the story.<br/><br/>After we where storyed gamed out, and done with the game, we reviewed our timeline in chronological order, and it did make sense. While playing we didn't always know why events happened, but they could always be explained at some latter time. <br/><br/>This game comes closest to collaborative novel writing, then any RPG I have ever played.

(Hopefully most of what we said got back to you in one form or another.) Nonetheless I will ramble a little here.<br/><br/>I do feel like tone debt was kind of opaque and difficult to manage -- in fact we never used it in our entire session, which may be part of why I don't get it (seeing it in play usually helps.) The problem is that you need to understand how to use it before you can see it in play, because otherwise nobody can tell when the opportunity exists to spend it.<br/><br/>Lenses are a great idea, and worked to interesting effect, possible because Ping chose an actual person as the focus. The first few additions after the Lens was announced were very literally about the person and his specific historical period, but after several concrete scenes there was a kind of dispersal effect as players tried to find ways to add in Lens-related elements to unexpected places. This seemed like a natural and desireable effect, since it created a sort of historical interpenetration which is (I assume) one of the emergent properties of the game. It widened the scope in which the Lens element could later be reincorporated.<br/><br/>Scenes still need work, I think. We had issues with when to cut scenes (I felt some got cut early because we had happened to answer the question, but the scene felt dramatically incomplete) -- and I regularly chose characters with no intention of answering the question, but instead because they seemed to fit the scene <i>as a scene</i>. I feel like any scene in a game has inherent dramatic requirements, and they seemed at times to be interfering with the informational/mechanical requirements of the game (answering the question.)<br/><br/>Nobody ever narrated a complete scene outcome from the beginning -- I think this is an option that needs to be explained &amp; supported well in the text, because it feels like a really important middle-ground in terms of pacing &amp; scene turnover.<br/><br/>I want more wrap-up at the end of a scene besides just deciding if it was light or dark (another thing we struggled with a lot, surprisingly.) Specifically I would love to have another round of 'thoughts' at the end, since the thoughts were my favourite thing about scenes in general.<br/><br/>I would like to see a mechanic or explicit structured opportunity for naming things and people. Ping clearly felt (probably based on her previous experience with the game) that this was not actually a good idea. But... the one element that was named (which I was forced to name because I wanted to reincorporate it in a way that required a name) ended up being reincorporated probably three or four additional times. By comparison, there was not a single other case of concrete reincorporation (that I remember) in our entire game. Names create focus and focus is obviously crucial in this game. I suggested (or maybe Ralph suggested?) that this could be done at the end of every scene -- choose one character or scene element to be named or otherwise made more real, to help guide future reincorporation/characterization.<br/><br/>It was suggested (by Ralph but I could be paraphrasing poorly) that more could be done to facilitate adding details to elements <i>besides answering a scene question</i>. I agree very strongly that there were often lots and lots of things <i>I wanted to know</i> but that I didn't want to know <i>enough</i> to spend an entire scene finding out. Some of these were important colour about our Pallette elements (what do the Apocalypse Cults believe?), some were more incidental (what do members of this particular Apocalypse Cult wear?) And while we did manage to introduce some of this colour into scenes incidentally, the intense Question-based focus of the scene tended to curtail those opportunities. There were several scenes where I saw opportunities to really flesh things out, but those opportunities were largely missed; as a result several story elements that were clearly Very Important to the overall story we were telling still felt very anemic -- there wasn't a lot to them, despite their importance. <br/><br/>Now naturally, if we continued play, I could introduce scenes to answer the most egregious of these gaps -- but as mentioned, an entire scene seems like a fairly high price to pay, when there is no particular single Question missing, but rather a whole bunch of half-questions that, together, would give the element a greater solidity. And on the one hand I can see how this tension is important to drive the game and have players make choices about resource allocation -- but it was definitely an issue in our game, and something I would be interested in seeing play out over a multi-session game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216285/#Comment_216285" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T16:21:06+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  4:21PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In fact in retrospect it's not clear that Tone added anything to our game at all.

I agree that Tone Debt feels a little hard to use effectively, but I'd like to try the game again to make sure the problem isn't with my understanding of it.  In particular, I felt like there needed to be some way to get it off of Events and onto the governing Period, because we found ourselves with a lot of Tone Debt sitting on Events that we felt no need to play any further Scenes in.  Just seemed like a waste.  In general, when we wanted to bend a Scene in a particular way, we brought in a Legacy instead.<br/><br/>I thought the light/dark split was actually very easy to use (and perhaps most importantly, judge), but then we were pastiching Lovecraft so it was kind of easy to tell which one a Scene ended up as.<br/><br/>And speaking of time travel, I want to give some major props to Ben for making a game that encourages fourth-dimensional thinking.  It's a really rare and bizarre thrill to think about framing Scenes that foreshadow events we've already played out.

I'm totally into seeing how it winds up. I really like the drilling down from periods to events important in that period to scenes that illustrate those events.  I think that part is the most solid of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the Lens picking a topic that everyone else has to focus on for that round around the table.  I think that nicely sets the stage for those bubbles of history that get a ton of coverage while others get skipped over with just sketchy mention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to see the game move more towards a model of "History is the story of great people doing great things".  Conversely if this is definitely not the model of history that Microscope seeks to emulate...then I'd scrap the whole roleplay through scenes piece altogether (more on that below).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my way of thinking, if you're going to portray individual people in scenes that illustrate a moment in history, then I want those people to be the people whose names show up in history text books from future periods.  Not every scene has to be a moment in the life of Jefferson or Napoleon, the occassional scene where ordinary joe's are reflecting on "where they were when Kennedy was shot" is a great contrast.  But it doesn't really work for me if EVERY scene is that.  Babylon 5 did an episode where some major event was going on but most of it was being seen through the eyes of a couple of maintenance laborers going about their shift.  It was a really compelling episode.  But if the entire show had been that way...not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, at least based on one brief con experience, I didn't feel like we had sufficient time or motivation to establish any of the characters as both "historically significant people" and "people with any depth".   We had a president who was revealed as being secretly a mutant in the midst of anti mutant fervor who gave a speech to congress so impassioned it went down in history as one of the great speaches of all time (a Legacy in the game).  Future space ships were named after this guy.  But yet we knew nothing about him at all.  In fact, I don't think he even had a name in the one scene where he got played...the name was invented later because we needed a name for the space ship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat really doesn't work for me.  What I'd like to see more of are the little snippets of stuff that people remember...accurate or not, so what...people remember strange stuff...like Washington had wooden teeth and Napoleon was short and Kennedy chased skirts.  Things that would make these characters feel like what you would read about in a history text or remember from pop culture.  So, more opportunity to reincorporate characters who are important to a particular event or series of events in a period.  More opportunity to see them played and play them and accrue details about them that stick.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought:  drill down another level.  Period --&gt;Event--&gt;Scene--&gt;Character  where "Character" is just a representative individual not EVERY character the same way as a scene is just a representative scene and not every moment of every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarring that...I don't think I'd find the "roleplay characters in a scene" a very interesting activity if they're just blank generic placeholders who exist only to answer the question.  I'd rather just brainstorm an answer to the question with the other players and go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sense I got was that the primary purpose of roleplaying the scenes was that there's this question...and there are these characters who are in a position to answer the question...and you go through the motions of roleplaying until one of the players manages to work the scene into a situation where he can have his character spring the answer on the group...and whatever that is...it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can appreciate the desire to not create meely mouth touchy feely group hug history by having everyone collaborate and reach consensus.  And I can appreciate the desire to have sudden drastic answers that take the history in unexpected directions.  But I'm not sure if the "roleplay the scene until the question is answered" bit really gets it done in a way that I find very fun.  It felt a bit like playing Russian Roulette with the story where you hoped you'd be able to work your answer to the question in before the "gun goes off" and someone else springs some bizarre thing you hate into the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, you're trying to manuever the scene in a certain direction so that the narrative of the scene supports your answer...but you've got literally nothing to build on.  You know nothing about the characters, their personalities, their past, heck even their name.  So you can't really tell what the other players are trying to do, whether their character is acting normally (for them) or strangely (for them) its just a very surreal experience.  I guess here's what I mean.  You have these characters.  They know each other.  Some of them might know each other intimately.  Colleagues, coworkers, family, lovers, hated enemies...whatever...but WE don't know any of them...or anything about them.  So its almost like roleplaying a bunch of people who have amnesia.  Say I'm playing your husband...but I don't know if we have a good marriage or a bad one.  I don't know if I love you or I married you for money.  I don't know anything about our relationship at all.  So I'm roleplaying and I'm making up how my character feels about yours as I go.  And that may totally not mesh at all with the version of our relationship that you're making up as you go.  And we have no details at all to go from...and it just...doesn't feel right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really liked the history building parts of the game.  But to be perfectly straight forward...I did not enjoy any of the roleplaying segments at all.  They all felt hollow, artificial, chaotic, and ultimately unnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my recommendation that I shared with Ping was this:  either find some good ways to bolster the importance and depth of roleplaying the characters.  Or scrap the roleplaying parts altogether and just play the entire game at the meta level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/batsofchaos" title="batsofchaos"><img alt="batsofchaos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/batsofchaos">batsofchaos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217525/#Comment_217525" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T11:59:20+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 11:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my opinion, Valamir, you aren't approaching the role-playing segments in the intended way.  You're not supposed to get inside the character's heads and figure out their motivations because their isn't enough time or focus to do so; to borrow some DnD terms these characters aren't Player Characters they're minor NPCs.  They should be improvised not planned.  When going into a scene, pick two or three characteristics you're going to give the character and hit the ground running.  Relationships with other characters in the scene and facts about characters should be established in action and conversation and when one is presented run with it (or subtly refute in through other action or conversation).  Keep it loose and be flexible.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding whether these characters are important to the overall narrative, or one-shots is entirely up to the group, not the rules.  If you like the president who gave the great speech and want to know more about him set him as the focus for your next turn.  How important a person, and object, a location, anything is to the history is entirely up to the players.  Most characters played are not going to have a tremendous impact outside of their own scenes, but those that do should come to light and can be zoomed in on and highlighted appropriately.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217529/#Comment_217529" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T12:19:28+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 12:19PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's the thing Michael.  Playing minor NPCs is Not Fun.  Playing minor NPCs is something that's only enjoyable in the context of watching them interact with PCs.  If there are no PCs* to interact with  then playing a revolving door of blank slate NPCs in scene after scene is an exercise in tedium...at least for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you aren't supposed to get inside their heads and figure out their motivation...why use role playing as a game technique at all?  Instead of roleplaying the scene why not just story board it from a 30,000 foot 3rd person level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething like:<br/>\n"Ok, in this scene the president's been called in to testify in front of congress on the mutant issue"<br/>\n"right and there's a senator there who's totally anti mutant and he has evidence that suggests the president is one"<br/>\n"right so there's a bunch of back and forth questions from various senators on the panel and politically dodgy answers for a while until finally that senator springs his accusation on the pres"<br/>\n"exactly, and that's when the pres admits in front of everyone that he is, in fact, a mutant, and gives an impassioned speech about freedom and humanity and mom and apple pie and all that that brings everyone to tears"<br/>\n"cool"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not just do that and skip the pretend role play.  That's the "scrap the roleplay" alternative I recommended.  Personally, I'd much rather see the roleplay expanded in an interesting fashion, but if that's definitely not part of the design concept then I'd go this route.  Because the kinda-sorta-but-not-really role playing that we were doing I didn't find to be very fun and a net detraction from the cool parts of the game that I did find fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*for purposes of Microscope read "PC" as "character developed enough to be interesting on their own merits"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Or scrap the roleplaying parts altogether and just play the entire game at the meta level.</blockquote>\nRalph, I absolutely heard your feedback and passed it on to Ben. I don't know if you read <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9747" rel="nofollow">the post-mortem I wrote about our game</a>, but we were tired and playing with 5 people and that's less than ideal because it means scenes have more secondary characters and the Lens/Current Player has a long way to go around. Also I didn't show or explain as Michael said above that we could still keep drilling down into interesting characters by creating new scenes for them or making them the focus of the Lens. I've played in games where we had 6 or 7 scenes with the same tyrant king from his youth to death because he was interesting, but that takes more time and ideally fewer players than we had. If a character is interesting in the scene, I have found that players can't resist going back to them because they have to find out what happened to that guy.<br/><br/>That said, it is true that Microscope is not a game about pre-defining characters with known backgrounds and motivations before you go into scenes and most characters appear once never to appear again usually because they're not interesting enough to the group. Sometimes you might know a lot about the character because of established facts or previous scenes with said character, other times (especially the beginning obviously), as it was pretty much the whole time in our game, you know very little and are establishing it right there in the scene. Through thoughts and picking characters, you can give some hint to motivations and tell the other players where you are going with the character in the scene, so they have a chance to play off it, but a lot of it is improv, hence the recommendation of not playing if you're tired because you really have to be alert to other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217564/#Comment_217564" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T16:27:38+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  4:27PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think its more than just that though.  Admittedly throwing the lens on a character and playing through several scenes with them will help with some of it, but I don't know that that gets to the real issue that I wasn't enjoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause its clear that the game is not a collaborative exercise, because each scene is focused on one question and one question only, and because driving towards an answer to that question is the only real goal of the scene -- there's an element of...competition isn't the word I want...gamesmanship maybe.  Where you're trying to use your skill as a roleplayer to move the scene and shape it towards a particular end...answering the question in the way you'd like to see it answered.  There's an element of narrative tug of war where you don't want to be the lamo who just blurts out the answer to the question with no fictional support for it, but you also want to steer things to avoid answers you aren't as interested in, in favor of answers you are.  There's a whole narrative dance that's going on there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problems as I see it are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) this really isn't compatable with the idea of "just riff off the other guy" improvisational roleplay...because in improvisational roleplay you don't really have a vested interest in seeing things move a certain direction.  I could just play my character in such a way to make you awesome, and I well might if its a question that I don't care what the answer is.  But if I do care what the answer is, because the game is so anti collaboration, its set up an environment where I have to "win" the improv roleplay to get the answer I want.  Trying to "win" at improv is I think inherently an ineffective technique.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Doing the narrative dance and trying to maneuver the scene the way you want can indeed be fun (as legions of chat room RPers can attest) but to do it well you need more touch points, more shared history, more character flags to play off of.  Trying to steer a scene with no touchpoints is like trying to steer a car on ice.  There's little friction to grab anyone's attention and point the narrative in a direction so as a result things just ping pong all over the place with little sense of a solid thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Its exhausting...which is why, as you've pointed out, playing while tired is not ideal.  But for myself, while I'm more than willing to put that kind of intense draining effort into my roleplaying, I'm less inclined to do so for characters that just don't matter.  There's no payoff.  Its a big emotional, intellectual investment on behalf of characters who aren't even real characters...just placeholders for scenes.  Not worth it to me.  If I'm going to put that kind of effort in (which I'm happy to do) I want it to be for a character that is interesting and worthy of my attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I also played a game of Fiasco that weekend.  A game where you similarly start with sketchy characters and a lot of improv style roleplay.  But in that game you start with a couple of elements to begin to riff off of.  You play the same character in several scenes over the course of the game. You can have more control over the "answer" to a scene by choosing that you're going to be the one to Resolve.  And there's much less game pressure to drive towards a specific answer before someone else beats you to it...largely because scenes don't end until everyone is satisfied with where to wrap it...so there's no "get my answer in before the scene ends" drive.  As a result, it was definitely worth my effort to invest in roleplaying Dr Alphonse Capresi.  I hope my fellow players would agree I did a pretty good job with him, and a I thoroughly enjoyed playing him in ways I don't think I could ever enjoy playing a character in Microscope under the current structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, at the risk of over harping on a specific point, I'd enjoy the game more if there was more development to the characters for me to sink my teeth into so I could care.  Or I'd enjoy the game more if there was just no actual roleplaying I need to do at all.  As it is, I'm not finding the middle ground of "yes you have to roleplay, but no the characters don't really matter" to be very fun.  But of course, some of that has to be speculation on the basis of a single abbreviated con session, but given the fundamental structure, I'm not sure more play would actually change my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/batsofchaos" title="batsofchaos"><img alt="batsofchaos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/batsofchaos">batsofchaos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217570/#Comment_217570" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T17:00:19+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  5:00PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've yet to try Microscope so I might be entirely off-base, but my assumption regarding scenes was they were to play out as sort of an abbreviated round of InSpectres; players throw out little kernels that start to pull back the veil on the question until the answer is either rendered apparent organically or through force with tone debt or legacies.

Even when the character was the focus of the game -- and for longer than the designer feels is ideal (ref: 'too many players'), we still didn't learn much about him <i>as a character</i>. (We did learn a fair bit about his impact on history, which is of course excellent and yay.)<br><br>Personally, I found the RP scenes to be okay but I basically ignored the question-requirement in favour of trying to situate myself in the scene with a character I wanted to play, or wanted to learn more about. This seemed to work okay with the larger number of players, since it was less crucial that everyone in the scene at least be capable of answering the question. <br><br>But I definitely still felt some of the 'gamesmanship' Ralph mentioned -- the scene about the sabotaged colony ship comes to mind, in particular, since I actually did have some interest in how that played out. (Amusingly enough, the answer to that question turned out to be what I wanted, but I was kind of dissatisfied with the narrative support/the way it actually roleplayed out.)<br><br>My favourite part about the scenes (as I think I already mentioned) remains the 'what is your character thinking' bit at the beginning.

Some scenes may be about the "movers and the shakers" deciding the fate of history, while others might just be personal vignettes showing what it's like to live in that history. It's totally up to the player creating the scene.<br><br/>- As others have pointed out, when you pick a character for a scene, you can say things like "I'm playing the President's mistress" and during the Reveal Thoughts phase you very actively tell other players what you are trying to do with the scene. So you should have a pretty good idea about the other characters before the scene starts.<br/><br/>- Yes, cool characters come back because a player chooses to bring them back. Players have authority to explore what interests them.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217660/#Comment_217660" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T07:25:27+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  7:25AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I have a copy of the rules that we played with that night I think.

The idea came up of using other people's settings, but honestly...?  We both hate HATE <b>HATE</b> reading somebody else's long-winded setting material.  (I could digress for paragraphs on why this is so, but to keep this post from being a rant both vitriolic and pointless, I'll refrain.)  For hopefully obvious reasons, we're also not all that eager to sit down and write long-winded setting material of our own.  <br/><br/>So far, we've had the most success so far with Universalis/Mortal Coil/fractal aspects -type approaches to setting creation.  The limitation there, however, is that, yeah, we have all these tenets and guidelines, but we rarely end up with a world with any real <i>personality</i>, somehow.  The wild and seemingly interesting settings we create just don't end up breathing on their own, for some reason.  We understand them, but we don't <i>know</i> them.<br/><br/>Now, a game--a game which may be FUN--that has as its goal the creation of a history...!  Could the other end result of this game (the first being the fun of playing it as it is) be useful as a backdrop in which to play other games?  Frankly, I don't see how it could not!  <br/><br/>Perhaps my real question, then, is whether or not you have any interest in having people play test Microscope with such a nefarious intent lurking in their hearts?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/batsofchaos" title="batsofchaos"><img alt="batsofchaos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/batsofchaos">batsofchaos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217667/#Comment_217667" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T08:15:22+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  8:15AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jef, there's a suggestion within the rules write-up to do that very thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217715/#Comment_217715" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T15:13:24+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  3:13PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like one the more reasonable nefarious uses for Microscope.

We were doing a fantasy type world, and decided to make the bookends the beginning and the end of the world. We set things up so that the the gods of the fantasy world were banished to this one from another dimension for some crime or another, and the world and the races came about from their deaths.

Even with that, the driver is going to have a rough time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>We did run into a problem, and that was there was a disagreement about whether something fell outside the bookends or not.</blockquote>\nDid she agree it was outside the bookends? Because if so you're agreeing that you're breaking the rules and just negotiating what you want to do about it, social contract style. It's up to the group to decide how to handle it. You can fudge and expand the history or just say "no way!" because that's not what you both agreed to, but it might be a long drive...<br/><br/>But you may have some wiggle room. Because the start and end are Periods, not Events, you can have things happen that are just before or after any Event <i>implied</i> by the Period description. So if your starting Period is the destruction of the Earth, there really is some moment within that Period when the Earth actually goes boom (which would be an Event if you actually made it). It's perfectly legitimate to show the days leading up to that boom, because they would still be part of that Period. These kind of implied Events can happen in other Periods too.<br/><br/>That may or may not be a solution in your case -- if it's clearly before the start Period you're back to square one.<br/>\n<blockquote>Is it okay if that prediction answers the question posed by that scene?</blockquote>\nYep -- see the last sentence of the Predict section, page 17.<br/>\n<blockquote>And how do you make an interesting question anyway? I got hung up because there was a scene I really wanted to play out, but I just didn't have any questions really.</blockquote>\nIt can take a little practice to get used to thinking in terms of Questions instead of just scene framing. Stop and think about the scene you have in mind. What's the point? What is interesting about it? What could be surprising? That should point you right at your Question.<br/><br/>Another trick is just to think about some detail that hasn't been decided and ask about it. We know the city fell. Did the king spare the city elders? Then you can take the same idea and twist it further by implying something unexplained, like "why did the king execute all the city elders but one?"<br/><br/>When I make Questions I usually have no idea where I'm going with it. I just aim for something big, twist it once or twice, and then see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218199/#Comment_218199" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T05:06:15+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  5:06AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben - she didn't agree.

There is much to say! But first, per the playtest feedback request, here are our vital stats:<br/><br/>- We play together frequently. Sometimes with other people, but usually just the two of us. <br/>- Eric only read the synopsis and the example of play. I read the rules and explained them as we went.<br/>- We've only played one Microscope session so far.<br/>- The last three games that I recall were Fate 2.0, Wushu, and...Savage Worlds? I don't remember. We play a lot of Wushu and Fate, but we're looking to branch out.<br/><br/>As mentioned in a previous post, we were playing with an eye towards creating a cohesive history as a backdrop for our regular gaming.  In this regard, I consider the game a smashing, smashing success.  In one rather slow-paced session, we came up with a history that has nice, meaty hooks into scenarios we'd really like to play, including tactical or cinematic zombie fighting action, 40K-ish Space Inquisition DitV stuff, Traveler-esque exploration, Sorcerer-like explorations of power and repercussions of using it, etc. The list really goes on, and all of it is <i>interesting</i> because of the shiny new context we've created for them.  There were also some real "holy SHIT!" moments.  <br/><br/>So here's what worked:<br/>- The rules in general. Easy enough to explain and understand, especially since there weren't a lot of fiddly bits and exceptions to keep track of.  The biggest hurdle here was getting a sense of what the game was actually all about.  Yeah, "history, but...what other game is it like?" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>   Thankfully, a few rounds of playing made the rhythm flow become a bit more obvious. The writing was clear and the concepts were well-demonstrated in the examples.<br/><br/>- Tone: I thought at first that the dichotomy between "light" and "dark" was just a little too, er,<i> black and white</i> to be very useful or interesting.  However, in play, we used tone easily, and it was even helpful to be able to lay down a vague event that even the author doesn't fully understand, but still be able to wave in the direction of "this sounds nice, but it ends badly. Very, very badly." Tone debt, on the other hand, didn't get a lot of play, but not for any particular reason.  It seems workable, we just didn't get a chance to invoke the debt we'd built. In fact, I really like the incentive that it gives you for exploring dark within light and vice-versa, as well as the balancing influence that invoking it has, as well as the cool player benefit of using it (scene control).  Keep this!<br/><br/>- Legacies.  Legacies presented themselves in play very naturally. There were a few themes that were coming up over a few times, so...BAM!  The ability to create or invoke them at will is nice. And, although the flip-flopping of the tone screwed me out of using a particularly legacy once when it would have been PERFECT, I still think the alternating tone idea is a really neat one.<br/><br/>- Initial thoughts:  This silly little bit about saying what your character is thinking before a scene started made a WORLD of difference for me, both in giving me more to go on with my own character, as well illuminating some of possibilities of where the scene might go. This was actually my favorite aspect of the game.  It's so elegant... simple, character-illuminating, player-communicating, and conflict-generating, all in a sentence or two.<br/><br/><br/>Where we had trouble:<br/>-  Goal.  Eric expressed that he came away from Microscope feeling that it was more of a brainstorming or creative writing exercise, rather than a game.  When I was explaining the rules up front, in particular, he was trying to leverage the "goal" or the "point" of the game in order to place the other rules in context.  This was obviously problematic, since the best goals I could come up with were, "make something cool," or "the <i>experience</i> maaaaaan!"   It seems like Microscope is more sandboxy than it is overcome-the-antagonisty.  I happen to like sandboxes, so I didn't have a problem with this.  But I realized that this absence of any sort of end-game condition will most definitely keep me from playing this with my casual and non-gamer friends.  I just don't want to keep hemming and hawing around the question, "what's the point?"  I don't see this as a problem with the game itself, so much as a different strokes issue.<br/><br/>- Playing out scenes.  This was definitely one of the most problematic areas for us, for a number of reasons: <br/>    - For one thing, with only two players, we felt terribly constrained in our ability to make things happen in a scene. The limitations that keep a player from steamrolling a scene in (the 1 free NPC action in particular) would have worked much more naturally in a larger group.  But as it was, we ended up having to bend the rules to allow us to narrate what we felt was interesting.  Some of this was our own difficulty in sticking to the rules, however.  Like I said, we're used to the wordy free-for-all of Wushu.  This strikes me as something we need to <i>practice</i> to get right in Microscope.<br/><br/>    - I personally enjoyed the roleplaying that went in our scenes. I dug the improv nature of it. Eric, however, felt the same as Valamir, above, in the sense that he didn't really get into playing "NPC level" characters. He's more of a deep characterization guy, and our history was broad enough that we didn't really have any re-occurring "PC" types. Playing with a shorter timeline might have helped this (we later considered trying a game where the bookends were the birth and death of a single individual).<br/><br/>    - Absolute Power: I introduced a scene because I genuinely wanted to see what would come up when we tried to answer the question.  I had no real preconceived ideas about what could or should happen, but Eric's eyes totally lit up.  Unfortunately, my scene framing and character list precluded him from really using his idea.  Further, when he told me later what he had in mind, it clearly should have been a dictated scene.  I would have really liked to have the option to "go where the fire is," and turn over some of my authority for the sake of someone else's excitement and what that can bring to the story.  In hindsight, I suppose I could have rescinded the scene and then let him play it on his turn, but I felt at the time that the die had been cast.  Again, part of this is us getting a handle on and obeying the limitations imposed by the rules, but neither of us are very comfortable with the idea of watching someone's awesome wither because the rules dictate that my weak-ass ideas MUST take precedent this round.  Perhaps some sort of credit for passing the talking stick voluntarily...?  <br/><br/>There may be more, but this is wordy enough as it is.  In conclusion, I love it.  Eric's lukewarm on it.  We could both use another session to explore it and possibly change our minds.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219181/#Comment_219181" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T16:50:55+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  4:50PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Ben - she didn't agree. She thought it was within the bookends, I didn't. But what you say about wiggle room makes sense. Is there any method of resolving disagreements like this? Whether an event falls inside one period or another, or of it falls outside the bookends completely? It's probably unnecessary and this may have been a random weird incident.</blockquote>\nI don't think there's a silver bullet. Barring all the wiggle room stuff we already talked about, if players disagree about what's outside the bookends it probably means they aren't talking about the same thing -- either their conception of the bookends didn't match in the first place or the thing being added isn't what one of them thinks it is. In that case discussion must ensue to make sure everyone's on the same page. Big note: discussion to clarify, not negotiation.<br/><br/>Normally a player has _no_ authority to tell another player they're putting an event in the wrong period, unless some established fact is being contradicted ("you can't have an event about the city then, we know it was built in the next period"). There is no "but it fits better there" argument.<br/><br/>And again, if one player thinks a fact is being contradicted but another disagrees, someone has a different vision of the established fiction than someone else -- reviewing what you already know to make sure you have the same idea of what has been established is necessary. That's why asking for clarification is so important when someone makes something and you're not sure you get it (and probably should be made more prominent in the text), but of course that assumes that you know you don't know...<br/><br/>Players not being aware that they have conflicting visions of what is happening in the fiction is something that happens in all games, because let's face it, it's all imaginary. In lots of games you may not even notice, but in Microscope it will smack you in the face and make you deal with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219736/#Comment_219736" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T23:59:23+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 11:59PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 12:01AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: derthnada</cite>In one rather slow-paced session, we came up with a history that has nice, meaty hooks into scenarios we'd really like to play, including tactical or cinematic zombie fighting action, 40K-ish Space Inquisition DitV stuff, Traveler-esque exploration, Sorcerer-like explorations of power and repercussions of using it, etc. The list really goes on, and all of it is interesting because of the shiny new context we've created for them.

You're making them after all.<br/><br/>Here's an easy trick: make a particular person the Focus. Even if you start off knowing nothing about the guy, you explore him a lot. The counter-point to that is in a two-person game the Focus is relatively short-lived. But if the next Lens likes the character, theirs nothing from stopping you making him the Focus again (or something related).\n<blockquote>but neither of us are very comfortable with the idea of watching someone's awesome wither because the rules dictate that my weak-ass ideas MUST take precedent this round.

I was happy to ignore it for a con game, but philosophically I find "person X gets to say and there's not a damn thing anyone can do about it except quit playing" to be a poor design choice.  Similarly for "person X must say and there's no way for them to get out of it".<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there some particular agenda that you have for the game that makes you believe that such rules are what make Microscope work?

The other side of the equation is that even though you're required to contribute, because the game jumps all over the place in time and space, what you contribute does not have to be central. If you want to add something small or off in the corner, feel free. And if you add something no one likes, other players won't build on it.

Yeah.  Definitely not a philosophy I share...or would really have any desire to play under.  If you destroy Earth, the ability to rewind to a time where Earth still exists does nothing for me at all.  In fact, its rendered everything I've done or would do in "Earth before it blows up" to be utterly transitory.  You've unilaterally diminished all of my contributions to "but ultimately none of that mattered".  So from my perspective...you've totally taken stuff away from me.  Stuff I very well may not want to have taken away from me.  Other times or other things I might not mind being taken away.  But sometimes I will.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that was part of the bookends...that's one thing.  We agreed to that and I incorporated that expectation into my play.  But if you spring that on me mid game and there's nothing I can do about it?  Yeah...definitely the last time I'd ever play that game with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Bret, browbeating outside of the mechanics is exactly the sort of suck that having in game mechanical recourse helps avoid / deal with.  I HATE it when the only recourse I have is social badgering and manipulation.  Largely because I'm really damn good at social badgering and manipulation and really dislike it when I find myself pulling that crap at a game table.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if the game leaves me no other choice about something I really care about...that's IMO not very good design.  Or if the game expects me to just be casual and not ever care that much about something I create...that's not IMO a very compelling way to spend a few hours of time.

These two cases are both more slippery. A player can choose a character in a scene but basically just sit out if they want to, and players can also be very clever in interpreting the Lens' Focus (you say it's the war, but I don't like the war, so I have a scene in the far future of children reading about the war in their history books). So really you have fairly little power to make another player do something.<br><br>Guy your "transitory" point is a really good one. It's a core premise of Microscope: if you're looking at a vast swath of history, all the characters are going to die sooner or later. That's just how it works. Dying doesn't diminish them. Fallen Troy is still Troy in the eyes of history.

Whatever direction I had wanted things to go has now been rendered moot by a big giant boom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd its not that the game went in a direction I didn't anticipate that's the problem (having games go in unexpected directions is the key joy of roleplaying vs. just writing fiction).  The problem is that 1) there was nothing I could have done to prevent it from happening, 2) there is nothing I can do now that it's been said, and 3) there is nothing to ensure that the Earth exploding is in any way pertinent and not just some random throwaway "i can't think of anything so 'everybody dies'" knee jerk statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> to be utterly unacceptable as it renders my efforts as a player completely moot...If there is nothing I can do to stop that from happening than nothing I'm doing is really doing anything at all.  Playing helpless characters can be fun.  I have zero desire to be a helpless player.  Giving any one player absolute creative authority (such as the ability to create an Event "The Earth Explodes") is simultaneously stripping all other players of all creative authority.  For that moment I have no authority at all...none...I am helpless in a way that goes beyond deprotagonization and into a whole new category.  Its not my character that's been deprotagonised...its me.  As a player, I've essentially been creatively emasculated.  I've no doubt that this isn't the intention of the rule.  But that's what such rules actually do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> to be socially dangerous and completely unnecessary.  There are an infinite variety of genre appropriate ways for players to resolve creative differences in a game without resorting to social bickering or having no recourse but to quit playing.  I consider failure to provide such a mechanism in a game to be a weakness not a feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> to be creatively destructive in most cases.  There are times when having to adapt to someone's half ass bullshit actually turns into a compelling plot twist that we wouldn't have otherwise discovered...but most of the time its just half ass bullshit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to summarize:  If we're playing the game and you put out an Event Card that says "The Earth Explodes" then the group better be able to look you square in the eye and say "What the Fuck is up with That?"  and expect you to justify that event in a way that demonstrates that its a meaningful and compelling addition to what's being created and not some half ass bullshit you just thought up because its your turn and you couldn't think of anything good.  And if it is just half assed bullshit then the game had better give the group a way to say "The hell with that, do something else".  And even if it IS something that is meaningful and compelling to you, if its a direction that no one else wants to go in and you can't persuade them to try it, then the group should still be able to say "Uhhh, we're not feeling that, do something else".<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise the entire group is held creative hostage to your whim...and that's not something I find fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219945/#Comment_219945" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T16:18:59+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  4:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>As a player, I've essentially been creatively emasculated.</blockquote>\nGetting kind of melodramatic, don't you think?<br><br>Ralph, I feel like you're interpreting everything in the most negative possible light, reducing any subtleties into absolutes.

Isn't the rule that you _can't_ pass or veto?  That's the absolute.  If the rule was instead "you normally don't pass and you should try to avoid veto"...then you have room for subtleties.  Unless the rule has been misexplained to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd its not a trust thing.  I've had this discussion a ton of times and typically it initially gets dismissed as "you need to trust your players" or "don't play with dicks" or what have you.  But that's really not the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can totally trust you...I can totally respect your creative abilities...I can totally enjoy playing with you...and I can still absolutely totally hate to a game breaking degree the idea you just contributed...and vice versa.  And that's not you being a dick or me being a dick.  Its just two creative people having a completely reasonable creative difference.  A difference that IMO a well designed game will provide a vehicle for resolving.  If the game does not provide a vehicle for resolving it...if my only option is to suck it up and deal or quit playing...if my creative input on the issue is not factored in at all...then is it really melodramatic to say I've been creatively emasculated?  That's issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's put it out there.  We're playing.  You just played the "Earth Explodes" event.  Let's take on faith, that for some completely legitimate non dickish reason such an event just totally deflates my enjoyment and ability to engage productively with the game.  If I indicate that to you...would you be willing to alter your event to something that doesn't totally derail me?  Or would you be all "screw you Ralph, I get to say whatever event I want"<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the latter...then yeah...emasculated...and totally not interested in playing.  If the former...and I suspect, just because we're both decent human beings, that it would probably be the former...then what's REALLY going on in the game is a degree of give and take and group buy-in to creative contributions.  And if that's the case...then that really should be formalized in the rules instead of pretending in the text that it doesn't happen that way.  That's issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, there are times when even creative people draw a blank and the game is just better if they punt, let someone else take the lead.  Yes, my three points included a good bit of hyperbole, but the fact of the matter is if you shine the spotlight on someone and force them to create on demand...with some degree of regularity what you are going to get is not that person's best efforts but merely the best they could come up with at the time.  If the game does not provide a mechanism for filtering such contributions so that you draw out people's best...but instead enshrines even their sub par efforts as canon...then you have a game built on a whole lot of sub par efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the people who love the game stress how exhausting it is to play...don't play when tired...don't play while drinking...Is that really a feature?  Perhaps that is a symptom that you've created a play structure that puts an unnecessary burden on players.  A burden that ultimately can be alleviated by tapping into the synergies of the group rather than trying to force everyone to stand alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that what REALLY goes on around the table in a game of Microscope is a whole lot of informal unspoken consensus building.  Consensus building by body language and by people catering to the preferences of players they already know.  I suspect that the "no consensus building" "no passing" "no veto" stance that you've taken sounds better on paper than in practice.  I suspect that in practice passing occurs regularly...in the form of someone drawing a blank, someone else offering an idea, and then the first someone adopting that idea as their own (which is essentially creatively the same as passing).  I suspect that in practice vetoing occurs periodically...in the form of someone self editing something they know the other players will hate or changing their minds after interpreting body language "oohh wait, no...this is even better..."<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are my suspicions.  Maybe they're completely wrong and off base.  But if they're not completely wrong and off base, then I submit that you may want to reevaluate your rules to make them more reflective of what is actually going on at the table that is producing functional play.  My money is on some form of group buy-in to individual creative contributions being a critical component of success.  And if that's true...then THAT should be your rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219970/#Comment_219970" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T17:34:05+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  5:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Microscope is an experiment, so I'm following scientific method: state the hypothesis, collect data, see if the results support or disprove the hypothesis.

There is at least one way I can see without thinking much that gives a player an out if she can't think of something - asking a non-tricky question about an existing event (i.e. "why did the Persians lose?" rather than "which Persian chose to make the Persians lose?"). That's a scene. Now everyone else can chime in with their awesome thoughts. I don't think there's any problem here for anyone besides the obvious "can we make the hard work easier", correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>The second is when someone creates something she finds meaningful and compelling but the group does not. Phrased that way it sounds simple - the group wins. In reality, of course, "the group" doesn't fail to find something compelling. Individuals do. Perhaps, in the extreme case, every individual but the creator thinks the creation is half-assed bullshit. What do we do in that case? Majority vote? Throw out all ideas that aren't found compelling by every individual at the table? Designate one person as ultimate gatekeeper? All of those are possible solutions with their own merits. Microscope's solution is that the creator is the final authority. As long as the creator really does find the creation meaningful and compelling, it's a fine solution with its upsides and downsides just like the others. One advantage that e.g. only-universally-compelling-contributions has is that you're guaranteed everyone finds every given contribution meaningful - one advantage that Microscope has is that you're guaranteed not to be locked out of certain ways of having fun due to e.g. someone else in the group not caring about Tom Bombadil.<br><br>In sum,<br>a) Microscope fails faster to social problems than most games will.<br>b) Given a healthy social dynamic, Microscope gives you a wider range of acceptable creative contributions than most games will at the cost of a greater possibility you will find someone else's legitimate creative contribution uncompelling or gamebreaking.<br><br>ETA: just saw your idea about informal, unspoken consensus building - very interesting, obviously at least partly true. I'd much rather introduce something I find awesome and I suspect most or all of the rest of the people I'm playing with would find awesome than something I'm not so sure they'd like, even if I love it just as much. That's the way social interaction works. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But really, I have no idea how *much* we changed our behaviors based on body language, etc. I don't recall anyone *ever* doing the faux-passing thing you suggest in our AP, though it happens plenty in other games. Or the faux-vetoing. Except kind of, once, during the initial Setup, when one player created a Period "the aliens land at Atlantis" and the other two players faux-vetoing it as being an Event, so it was changed to "the aliens' contact with Earth at Atlantis" (or something), referring to a longer stretch of time.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219975/#Comment_219975" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T18:06:01+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  6:06PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like if someone does "Event: The Earth goes boom" and you had a stake in what happened to those people, you could do a scene where you ask the question "What happened to those people?" and use the mechanical leverage you do have (Debt Tokens, Legacies, etc.) to make them get away in a spaceship and be on the run from the destroyers of the planet in a really interesting and compelling period.<br><br>Hey, sounds familiar.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219976/#Comment_219976" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T18:11:01+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  6:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy, yes.

There are a lot of good points on both sides, here, but for me it kind of boils down to the spirit of the game, which seems to be something like "take this idea and run with it!"  Or away from it. That's cool to, because you're still reacting.  It's a game like a relay race.  Pass the fiat.<br/><br/>I think somebody else already put this more eloquently, but how is having my world-ending event voted down by the group any less satisfying for me than having it enforced would be for someone who didn't want it?  Or having dice decide in either case?  Again, the spirit of Microscope says to me that, for this game, I am going to accept what other people put in, and see what I can do with it.  We make similar commitments to randomizers...so why not people?  When we play SotC next wek, i can suggest ways to bolster another player's uninspired narrative.  Or when we play 4e, I can explain to the GM how gave me no recourse when he unleashed the horde of undead upon us, because what *I* really wanted was for it to be a whorde of hot lesbian elf priestesses of an unholy sex cult.  <br/><br/>Yeah.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220550/#Comment_220550" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T05:37:36+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  5:37AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jef, that's a really good way of looking at it.<br/><br/>From a whispered question:\n<blockquote>Any thoughts yet on when Microscope might be 'release ready' (whatever form that takes)?</blockquote>\nAny estimate would be premature.

Because there's always room in the middle. You can add in events or periods before "the Earth explodes" that completely change the context of the event in question, such as "Colonization of Earth" or "humans flee earth before the invading interdimensional hordes arrive." Playing Microscope is like building a rollercoaster at the same time you're riding it, so what's the problem with building in a few loop-de-loops?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, a really evil player could drill down from the event to a scene where he dictates an answer to the question, "who survives the destruction of earth," establishing it as a fact that no one survives. Of course, unless he does this in the ending period, and even if he does, there's nothing to stop you (save possible palette restrictions) from creating a race of intelligent life from hardy bacteria, that come to puzzle over the remains of human life in the eons to come.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222918/#Comment_222918" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T05:22:40+00:00" title="August  6, 2009  5:22AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Threadbare</cite>Playing Microscope is like building a rollercoaster at the same time you're riding it, so what's the problem with building in a few loop-de-loops?</blockquote>\nThat's pretty much it.

But that's also why Ralph wrote <i>Universalis</i> instead of <i>Microscope</i>. I also understand where Ben and John Harper are coming from. Ralph, all your arguments come down to, in my mind, "<i>Microscope</i> isn't <i>Universalis</i>, and I want to play <i>Universalis</i>." Part of the rationale behind <i>Microscope</i> seems, to me, to pushing the envelope in order to coax people into participating without fear of contradiction. One of the flaws of <i>Universalis</i>, in my mind, is that it tends to reward aggressive, control-freak players. Win a few Challenges and the token economy means you can often run roughshod over everyone else at the table for a while until they join forces to rein you in.
