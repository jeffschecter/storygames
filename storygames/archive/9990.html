My understanding is that the licensing deal is very cheap and favorable so even those who don't have to use it, use it anyway. <br/><br/>I'm not a lawyer but I don't believe you need Chaosium's permission to use Cthulhu in an RPG as long as you stay away from their trademarks, tradedress, and stick to the public domain aspects of of Lovecraft's work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221810/#Comment_221810" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T09:59:42+00:00" title="July 31, 2009  9:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understood that licensing was complicated by Arkham House. Some of HPL's work is in the public domain. Some of it is (I believe) still controlled by Arkham House. Some of what gamers think of as part of the Mythos is, in fact, not even from HPL's work, but from the work of other authors (Ramsey Campbell, Brian Lumley, August Derleth, and others). Anything that makes use of HPL's mythology has to be reasonably careful to avoid using anything from the background that isn't wholly (and soley?) contained within the work that lies in the public domain.<br/><br/>Also, it's also not clear to me that Chaosium doesn't claim a trademark on the phrase "Call of Cthulhu" (as the trademarked name for their HPL roleplaying game) or even "The Cthulhu Mythos": certainly, "Trail of Cthulhu" is a trademark of Pelgrane. Accordingly, using the word "Cthulhu" in conjunction with an RPG is almost certainly done advisedly (i.e. it would be good if you took legal advice before you attempted it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221814/#Comment_221814" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T10:28:10+00:00" title="July 31, 2009 10:28AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite> Accordingly, using the word "Cthulhu" in conjunction with an RPG is almost certainly done advisedly (i.e. it would be good if you took legal advice before you attempted it).</blockquote>\nGod, that sucks SO much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221816/#Comment_221816" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T10:42:05+00:00" title="July 31, 2009 10:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>Accordingly, using the word "Cthulhu" in conjunction with an RPG is almost certainly done advisedly (i.e. it would be good if you took legal advice before you attempted it).</blockquote> God, that sucks SO much.<br/><br/>Pardon me, but I don't really see that.<br/><br/>There's absolutely nothing stopping you and your immediate friends from playing in HPL's mythos happily in the privacy of your own home, and all you want to. You could even come up with your own game rules to do so. Feel free.<br/><br/>Also, from all the creative properties that are available in the world, the HPL mythos is actually one that has wide-spread coverage and <i>really excellent</i> coverage already! I suspect that if you lined up all the actual play material for the mythos end to end, you would be hard pressed to actually play through it all in your lifetime. And that doesn't even count all the remarkably excellent material that's clearly <i>inspired</i> by the weird and HPL (::cough::Shab-Al-Hiri Roach::cough::In A Wicked Age::cough::).<br/><br/>Now we could start a long thread about who really profits from all the licensing and copyright and trademark and etc over any creative property, but I don't want to kick off that bag of cats, nor participate in it. It's already been done and redone.<br/><br/>But, I would highly recommend that you look at the Roach and In A Wicked Age, and maybe even Sorcerer (&amp; Sword) as ways to approach bringing fresh life/contributing to the community in a way that's IP neutral.<br/><br/>I'm not saying we don't have any more space for gaming that's inspired by HPL, the pulps, the weird, etc. What I'm saying is I don't really see any need at all to directly attempt to mine HPL's material specifically. Others are playing those tunes already. If you want to play in their bands, there are ways to do that (contact Chaosium and/or Pelgrane, etc, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221824/#Comment_221824" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T11:25:13+00:00" title="July 31, 2009 11:25AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An upside to the decline in fiscal liquidity in the gaming industry is that it's unlikely that anyone, other than possibly WotC or White Wolf, will launch spurious lawsuits at you for trademark infringement in any but the most obvious of cases.

You could be wildly successful, and then the original owners might want a piece of the action. Who knows what will happen?<br/><br/>But, you're absolutely correct that in order to get the proper advice on how to proceed means that one should approach the people already engaged present as licensors and licensees, and if and when you want to join their company, have some legal advice on your side to protect you from making bad decisions or engaging in something you shouldn't engage in.<br/><br/>I am not a lawyer.
