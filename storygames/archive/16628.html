Very interesting feelings on this one.<br/><br/>Those around long enough to remember, know that I was active on the Forge (it was pretty much inversely proportional to my busyness at whatever job I had at the time), to the point that I helped out at the Forge booth a couple times and all.<br/><br/>The Forge directly/indirectly produced a lot of games I enjoyed immensely. Dust Devils is still a go-to game for me.<br/><br/>Because of helping at the Forge booth, I made a bunch of friends; not just in Forge circles, I made some good friends that happened to be Japanese game designers (visiting GenCon one year, and collecting interesting/new/strange RPGs). Some of them became fast friends, and I visit them every year. It was that encounter that led me to start getting involved with translating Japanese RPGs. My white whale on that front is almost out, years later. Next year, I even plan on working on translating the game of one of these friends.<br/><br/>Also, more connected to this site, The Forge was the birthplace of Story Games.<br/><br/>There was a "Forge Birthday Forum" for one week (then archived) yearly, where people on the Forge talked about actually gaming: What they played, what they liked, what tips and tricks they used to make gaming better, etc.<br/><br/>Effectively, S-G was The Forge Birthday Forum's gaming topics, All The Time. <br/><br/>So yeah, pour out a little liquor for The Forge tonight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380517/#Comment_380517" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T23:40:46+00:00" title="June  1, 2012 11:40PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2012 1:26PM by Todd_L.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once found a website which was so inspiring--<br/>I read back sequentially thru its archives, feverishly <br/>trying to catch up to the latest offerings.<br/><br/>And the name of that website was<br/>Places To Go, People To Be.<br/><br/>Yet neither that great site,<br/>nor anything else I ever obsessed-over online<br/><br/>ever filled my head with a fraction of the weird shit<br/>that I'd tell my girlfriend about when she got off work<br/><br/>to find me having killed another day at the computer<br/>reading The Forge.<br/><br/>So say we all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380519/#Comment_380519" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T23:59:00+00:00" title="June  1, 2012 11:59PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2012 11:59PM by Matthijs.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, frailty.

Then we played rounds of <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Universalis</i>, and <i>S.O.A.P.</i><br/><br/>We decried games like the entire White Wolf line and <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, venerated games like <i>ZERO</i>, <i>Over the Edge</i>, and <i>Unknown Armies</i>.<br/><br/>Here's my final <i>verbatim</i> analysis of <i>Whispering Vault</i> from that course, fwiw:\n<blockquote>WHISPERING VAULT PRESENTATION<br/><br/>Embryonic Premise:<br/><br/>"You are Enlightened supernatural hunters of horrifying monstrosities that threaten the fabric of reality itself."<br/><br/>Stance:<br/><br/>Actually, this seems like one of those RPGs out there that actually does endorse Author stance over anything else. The game is focused on players dictating and describing creative character actions that then can be justified in-game either by their status as enigmatic supernatural hunters or by their mortal Keys that still bind them to the realm. The game doesn't concern itself with character study and perception so much as giving the characters a relatively omniscient perspective so that they can more readily deal with the in-game threats.  Personal horror and insanity are de-emphasized in favor of weirding out the players.  This could be possibly more/less effective than CoC or other games of the genre in that the character itself is not necessarily reactionary to the bizarre.<br/><br/>DFK:<br/><br/>Looks like a Fortune system to me, with characters that are significantly powerful enough to enable tasks with little to no risk or becoming automatic.  There is, however, a karmic element as well.  Each player has a pool of points (called Karma, appropriately) which they can spend in the facilitation of their Author Stance; they can use it to re-roll once an appropriate number of dice that they themselves determine for a presumably better result.<br/><br/>Character:<br/><br/>Stats are Fortune-based, with Karma and Vitality being Resources from which players may draw.  The metagame mechanics are based around the Five Keys possessed by each Stalker that signify the Stalker\u2019s connection with their past human selves.  The Balance of Power is, as in 99% of the games on the market, centered mainly on the GM, although the PC\u2019s begin with an enormous amount of power in relation to their environment, so one could argue that they have more control in the game universe than many Simulationist RPGs usually allow.  Players are also given complete freedom with describing their character\u2019s actions, as the GM seems to mainly provide the environment and reaction to these enormously powerful hunters of the dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Switches and Dials:<br/><br/>Character creation involves point distribution between four attributes (Awareness, Insight, Presence, Willpower) which thus manifests it as something like a limited dial that then breaks down into smaller dials and switches, depending on the original points allocated.  It\u2019s mainly a choice between which bad-ass capabilities you\u2019d prefer your Stalker to have.<br/><br/>Developed Premise:<br/><br/>The system promotes a very Focused Narrativist, Situation Simulationist game and according to Ron Edwards (pg. 23), was \u201cone of Narrativist gaming\u2019s published pioneers.\u201d  While it\u2019s no Sorcerer in terms of character motivation and PC-centric plot generation, the design overtly encourages players to take charge of situations through their own fairly diverse barrage of methods, and are given a Karma system to facilitate dramatic action.  Edwards alludes that the setting develops over time after the pre-play characters are developed, and I agree with that.  Here, the originality of the character and its empowerment is central, as well as the GM\u2019s creativity in designing an intriguingly eerie environment through which the PC\u2019s can move.  While the framework for plot development is relatively restricted, it\u2019s designed to simultaneously give PC\u2019s continuously new and bizarre Enigmas to solve.  Thus, the developed premise is:  \u201cThe players don the roles of vaguely human super-creatures of original design and practice that are sent to solve Enigmas across the time-scape of Earth.  Due to their mystic powers, the PCs are given a great deal of latitude in their approach to any given situation, take primarily an Author\u2019s stance.  The GM customizes and designs the Enigmas to the effect of presenting a simultaneously challenging and dramatic/exotic/hopeless situation for the characters to encounter.  The goal of a session is to generate a horrifying and/or dramatic story with either the Stalkers victorious over the Enigma, or dead in its unearthly wake.\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nAfter the "class" was over, I made an account on the Forge and lurked a while until I realized that this was a super <b>CONTENTIOUS</b> forum.  Less acrimonious things in life called out to me, and I followed them away from the forum.<br/><br/>I learned it was healthier for me to just GM, play, critique and create the games that emerged out of that primordial soup (my first three: <i>Riddle of Steel</i>, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, <i>InSpectres</i>).  And good games they remain.<br/><br/>Thank you, Forge, for all that I've learned over the years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380532/#Comment_380532" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-02T07:46:46+00:00" title="June  2, 2012  7:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad the Forge existed, I'm glad I stopped bothering with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380533/#Comment_380533" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-02T08:12:14+00:00" title="June  2, 2012  8:12AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Oh, and: Fuck you guys, immersion exists.</blockquote>\nNo, no!

I never posted much, but appreciated the uncompromising analytical standards Ron demanded.  The ensuing discussions were rigorous, often backed up by actual play experience, and full of fascinating insights.  For the first time, I really started to question what my own gaming practices brought me, what I really wanted, and how to see the difference between them.<br/><br/>I never had a negative reaction to any of the substantive content of the essays or threads, though I thought less loaded language could have made the same points without stirring as much contention.  (Frex, the notorious use of "brain damage" obliterated the point of that essay.)  The GNS model provided me new vocabulary for describing my actual play experiences, gave me a better, more structured basis for evaluating game design, and--this is probably most important--helped me understand and put a name to my own gaming preferences and goals.  So much of my experience prior to the Forge had been anecdotal and inchoate that just the analytical framework and glossary upended my apple cart.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'm grateful to the Forge for changing my thinking and pulling me into a ton of new games.

Is this for eulogizing or are we talking at the bar after the wake, a little drunk? <br/><br/>The Forge always felt inhospitable and obtuse to me \u2014 I'm a gamer invested in theory and practice, but with different jargon than the Forge's and often driven away by the Forge's attitudes and positioning \u2014 yet I found it a great and fascinating venue to search and read from the outside, marbled with wonderful notions and names to watch. <br/><br/>I came to S-G as a reader and poster wary and expecting to be distrusted or hated because of the Forge's legacy. The Forge made me nervous and hesitant to participate with a sector within the hobby, near to where I was making my career, by setting back my confidence and understanding of ideas I'd been neck-deep in. It made me think that everyone at the Forge was seeing hidden depths that I was not, despite all my contemplation and study, because look at the certainty with which they correct and defy each other. More assertive than curious, I felt. The Forge made me feel like I had unknowingly picked sides in a battle that I thought was bullshit and didn't want any part of. It set me back a few years.<br/><br/>Maybe all of that is for the best and was a valuable learning experience. The Forge always felt like something other people were doing who didn't want me around because I played and dug games that they decried. I'm thankful for many of the marks the Forge made on the hobby, still, and while I'm glad it had its day, the truth is that the Forge was closed to me some time ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382093/#Comment_382093" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T14:23:53+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  2:23PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I cannot figure out how to whisper on the new version of Vanilla, so I'll ask publically: can we get a SLOW DOWN on this thread?
