I remembered that it had a very fun character creation system, but now I very much disliked it. The luck has too many part in it. Rolling for the change of Social Standing while the years are passing is okay, but rolling for Special Events where the dice can make you go to jail or get a contact in a megacorp... It's not that it's too much, but it messes with how the player percieves his/her own character. It changes core elements of the PC.<br/><br/>Lately I was thinking about a rules system for Star Wars where you generate a character without knowing anything about its past or cultural context, but without focusing exclusively on minmaxing. (It is similar to my former system mentioned at the Forge.) It came to my mind that it would be ideal for MC, so I had a look at this system. This is it.<br/><br/>A PC consists of a list of items. Every item has four elements: a characteristic of the PC's description, a facet of the PC's personality, an ability (or possibility) and an equipment. These four elements are tied together. When generating a character, you can think any of it (a personality, a description, an ability, a piece of equipment), and once you have one of the four, you have to make up the other three. For example I want my character to be a "good sniper". This is an ability. So he has a "sniper rifle" wich is a piece of equipment. He is "always skinting with one eye", wich is part of its description. And "he stays calm in the most stressing sits", wich is part of his personality. (Now I thought that maybe this isn't right, because this is an ability, too. But if I would say "he looks calm", than it would be a description. Maybe four is too much. Or maybe not.)<br/><br/>The player distributes a number of points among the items of the list. So, these abilities are using that many "energy". But where is this energy generated?<br/><br/>This I call treasures. Every character has treasures. You have to distribute the euqal number of points among your treasures, as you distributed among your abilities. A treasure can be a friendship, a love. A treasure consists of elements, too: a feeling (love), something material (whom you love), a weakness (where you can easily be attacked) and a requirement (to hug her). The weakness is not that your love could be kidnapped or you could stop loving her, but something else, wich is much easier. For example if you talk about my love, then I get jealous. Or something like that. So this is seperate from the other two.<br/><br/>You don't have to match the treasuers and the abilities. You only have to match the sum of it.<br/><br/>So when you have a conflict or make a task, you allocate points from your appropriate ability. For example if my sniper wants to snipe someone and I distributed 10 points to my "good sinper" list item, then I have 10 points to distribute. To hit it I have to spend 5 points, but I don't know it, only the GM (or other player) knows that. So I spend 4, because I will still need points or I spend 6. I lose the points, but the latter hits, the former don't.<br/><br/>I get back some points between scenes (to make the players want downtime and force scene framing), maybe more when sleeping. When I meet the requirement, the points are refreshed. (Although meeting the requirement makes the treasure vulnerable.) But what if I have only 10 points, but to hit needs 12 points? Well, I lean points from my treasures, wich mean that I spend permanent points from the treasure. This means, that the treasure will be that much weaker afterwards. As I snipe better and better, I feel less and less love to her. This of course constraints the total sum of my abilities, wich have to be tailored to the sum of the treasures, too. Maybe meeting my requirement could refresh permanent points, too, dunno.<br/><br/>Now, the interesting things come. Because this is only an empty mechanic, wich has to be filled with content. For example a treasure can be life. So if I lose permanent life points, means that I get wounded.<br/><br/>The other interesting part of this game, is that you can measure the abilities of a character by learning its description. I think about Jango Fett or the big shoulderpads of MC.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
