What if I can't lose my gun?<br/><br/>Or, for an example that makes more sense, let's say that I'm "Loved" and I use it up on a roll, am I now no longer loved?  Does there have to be an immediate relationship to the fiction there, or can I just find out later that I'm not loved for some reason that happened off-screen?<br/><br/>After all, if I'm still armed or loved after the conflict, then by the rules I'm once again "Armed" or "Loved", which seems broken.<br/><br/>Any insights?

This doesn't have to mean that the thing it represents is gone, merely that you can't benefit from it again. Look at the description appended to the Condition: if you're "Loved... for your good looks", maybe you get scarred by this action; if you're "Armed... with hidden weapons", then using them means they are no longer hidden.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, there is a good advice section on P.33 about respecting the fiction, which boils down to "If it suits the fiction, roll with it; if it doesn't, dont." So, if another player thinks it plausible that the character should keep the Condition after using it, then they do. On the other hand, saying the character should keep a Condition because they haven't actually lost the thing that granted it to them sounds an awful lot like Bullshit (also on P.33). Using a condition is a significant move by the character or faction concerned and it should have an impact on both the fiction and themselves: if using it isn't enough to make them lose it, then its probably not enough to make a difference to the conflict they were in either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332534/#Comment_332534" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T12:40:20+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 12:40PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, in a libertoonian cyberpunk world where every grandma has a throwaway plastic machine gun in their purse that they got at the mall, "Armed" would mean a different thing from a highly controlled dystopia in which security cameras on every corner have metal detectors.  In one, having a carefully concealed polymer six-shot would be "Armed". In the other, if you don't have a rocket launcher you might as well not even bother talking about it.  <br><br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Mullen</cite>Using a condition is a significant move by the character or faction concerned and it should have an impact on both the fiction and themselves: if using it isn't enough to make them lose it, then its probably not enough to make a difference to the conflict they were in either.</blockquote>\nThis is the key to thinking about using the Condition (or any Condition).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332638/#Comment_332638" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T05:46:49+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  5:46AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having played several sessions now, I wouldn't go overboard with making Conditions *things of import*.  You should be gaining and losing them pretty constantly.  If you make the standards of using them too high, pretty soon every character will have all of them.  And no, being limited by what makes sense in the fiction is hardly a limit.  Any roleplayer worth their salt could come up with a decent fictional narrative to justify buying just about any PCon they want anyway, so if you're not spending them its pretty easy to wind up full up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes they're big deals in the fiction.  At Forge Midwest I lost my "Trapped: by my father's money" Condition in a scene where Dad was forced to negotiate for my assistance as equal partners, he needed me more than I neede him...I was no longer trapped.  Pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther times just think of them as a pacing mechanic.  I have a Big Gun, I'm "Armed".  I use Armed up and narrate something suitably destructive with my BFG.  At the end of the encounter, if I win, I can just use a success to buy "Armed" back as a PCon.  That doesn't mean I lost the gun and had to get another.  Or even that I ran out of ammo and had to reload.  I could have been narrating shooting my gun constantly throughout several scenes.  The PCon then is just timing how frequently my constant shooting actually carries an extra mechanical punch.  When I buy it I'm "charging up" the mechanical effect of having the gun.  When I don't buy it, I still have my gun...it just isn't going to be the focus of my success...even though I still describe myself shooting people with it.  That my not jibe precisely with the implications in the text...but it works way better.  Otherwise the whole "drive with the fiction" language just swamps the rest of the rules to the point of why bother with the rest of the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly if I don't buy "Armed" back at the end of the conflict I would not just get it back automatically just because fictionally I still have my gun.  I hate the way that piece of the rules you're pointing out is written.  If you take it completely literally it breaks the game completely.  Use that rule sparingly...like when your unarmed guy is running and hiding from a bunch of thugs with guns and then manages to knock one out and take his weapon...THAT'S an ok time to give him the "armed" PCon for free but don't go overboard with it or you'll ruin the currency of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I pretty much hate that rule in total.   In my ideal even picking up the gun wouldn't give him the "armed" Pcon.  It wouldn only give him the ability to take action in the fiction that included shooting back at the bad guys.  To actually get a "damn...I'm glad I had that gun, it just saved my ass" PCon effect, I'd make him buy it.  But I suspect that's a philosophical divergence from the intended design.  I think it works better mechancially, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332652/#Comment_332652" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T07:16:00+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  7:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2011 7:16AM by Ludanto.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, my instincts agree with you, and that's how I would do it by default.<br><br>Maybe I'll look at it like R|W|A, a "narrative guideline".
