These days its about a lot more than just the release.<br/><br/>/Wilhelm 2011-10-28<br/></i><br/><br/>--<br/>Today I got a package from the UK in the mail \u2013 the test print of my new game "While the World Ends \u2013 A story game about a future on the brink of change". Since the test print came out OK I have opened the Lulu shop to the public.<br/><br/>The game was written as my entry in the "Write an RPG in 2009" challenge on the WRNU boards. It was first released in Swedish, but after some discussions here I decided to translate and release the game in English too. Thanks again to Jens, John and Micah who proofread the game and gave it a lot better language than it would otherwise have had. And thanks to Seth that got me started.<br/><br/>It is a game for three to four players that can be played in an evening. It is GM-less and no-prep, or rather everyone does the prep together at the beginning of each game.<br/><br/>Before the game starts the players generate a futuristic world together, decide upon an important change that it is about to go through and two possible outcomes of that change. When the game starts the players follow the adventures of the main characters as they go through the story pursuing their goals and avoiding their fears. At the same time the players try to influence the story to lead they at the same time compete to drive the change into causing the outcome that they strive for.<br/><br/>That is, the outcome that the players strive for. The players are divided into two teams that compete to decide the outcome of the change, this is an RPG where you can actually WIN the game. Also the game is good fun... and Awesome!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/while-the-world-ends/13659977" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a><br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Edit: Two years later I have an actual webpage for the game. <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242426/#Comment_242426" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T13:00:44+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  1:00PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an added plug, I will say that I've read the game and it has some interesting concepts about how to mechanically guide improvisational play.

However, for stores to carry it they need margins, so I will have to <b>RAISE THE PRICE</b> in order to sell the game. Isn't it ironic?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm having a sale of sorts for now until the everything is settled. I priced the game in UK Pounds, but with the current exchange rates that makes for $7.55 for the book, and $3 for the PDF.<br/><br/>If you already spent all your money on Thanksgiving / X-mas stuff but still want to play an <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/while-the-world-ends/13659977" rel="nofollow"><b>AWESOME SWEDISH INDIE RPG</b></a>, send me a whisper.  For half a promise of a play report or review posted somewhere online I'll send you the PDF for free.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>You + three friends, three to four hours, some D6:es, pen'n'paper and preferably some tokens (glass beads, pokerchips etc) are needed to play but are not included in the game. No need to prep anything if you are going to facilitate the game, just read through the 40 page book and then follow the instructions once your friends show up.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>What will I do with my hoard of money made from selling this <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/while-the-world-ends/13659977" rel="nofollow"><b>AWESOME SWEDISH INDIE RPG</b></a>?<br/><br/>It goes back into my game making, I already have a day time job that pays the bills. At the moment I am working on a game about Prussean youth cadets or young witches &amp; wizards at a boarding school, or  space cadets in school on a space station in orbit. I'd like to purchase some illustrations for that game. I'll draw the pictures myself if I have to, but the game would be so much more awesome with pictures by someone who can actually draw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304406/#Comment_304406" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T13:21:34+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  1:21PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bit sad to do it myself, but here you are, an<br/><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/2010/12/14/playing-while-the-world-ends-by-wilhelm-person/" rel="nofollow">AP of While the World Ends</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324055/#Comment_324055" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T03:54:47+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  3:54AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally!

The game uses a "mind map" to track the state of the game, and the players draw it together at the start of the session while building the setting for their game. There is nothing magical about it, just a convenient way to show how everything fits together,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340864/#Comment_340864" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T15:16:35+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  3:16PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wilhelm, so.. when Sam says that there are ways to 'mechanically guide improv play', does he means that the map acts as inspiration?<br/><br/>Are there any prescribed procedures or advice to do that?<br/>E.g: "Look at a relationship and narrate how it is going to break"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340914/#Comment_340914" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-30T00:39:35+00:00" title="August 30, 2011 12:39AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ivan: I will not speak for Sam here but...<br/><br/>There are two ways to play WtWE, they are not explicitly explained in the book, but emerge out of actual play.<br/><br/>The first is "active", where you decide what you want to do or want to happen, play according to that and then update the mindmap accordingly.<br/><br/>The second is "reactive", (and I think this is what Sam is refering to) where you look at the mindmap, and it will tell you where your story will proceed and how to follow that route, and you play by that.<br/><br/>These two ways, or perspectives of play if you will, are totally interchangeable in play.  You can freely swap back and forth during play, and one team can play one way, while the other plays the other, without any adverse effects on game enjoyment.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Also, for the prep phase before the story starts there are clear instructions for what to do when and in what order to get everything right and create an evocative setting.  You can pick up the game, sit down with three friends and start from a blank slate and the game will entertain you by guiding you through an interesting story that was inside you all even if you didn't know it. (I'm not saying that this is a unique feature of WtWE that can't be seen in any other games, just that I find that WtWE is very good at doing it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345532/#Comment_345532" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T05:56:51+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  5:56AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some random strangers on the Internet took the time to play my game, AND they posted about it on the web.<br/><br/>This is, of course, supremely cool.

But it played very differently.  It gave a similar experience, but on a smaller scale. We were three players and the game took two and a half hours.<br/><br/>The sultan's favorite concubine was carried away by a giant eagle after having released all the songbirds from their cages.  The concubine's cousin, a gardener girl dressed as a boy, scaled the walls and set off to cross the western desert after seeing the night roses bloom one last time.<br/><br/>And the poor guard ended his days on the bottom of a well, cursing the sultans plot to make him go down there in search of an ancient secret passage leading into the harem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
