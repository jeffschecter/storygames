They make sense (save the "poseur" bits: that's just an impotent cynical critic being an impotent cynical critic).<br/><br/>But if you've played the game, the arguments don't stand. They simply don't stand. If you've played the game, you'll see it work: People aren't always scrambling for them. And when they're rewarded, that player gets the momentary rush of "I've contributed something and was recognized for it". I've played with about 60 people in 6 years, and have never seen a situation arise where (items 4 and 5 have been leveled on RPGnet against the Cool Die in other reviews):<br/><br/>1) People constantly aim for the cool die in that "grubbing for power" powergaming way.<br/>2) People ruin it by being "too cool, all the time". Milking the cool.<br/>3) People acting like posers.<br/>4) People feeling guilt for not getting the cool die, when they thought it was cool.<br/>5) People getting into this whole esoteric brain freeze about how John normally describes things cooler than Randy does, so how do we reward them fairly? Also the rewarding is all up to the GM/players, so if they're not "wired right" they might give out cool dice disprportionately, and Oh My God the subjectivity of it all!!!" (screamed while leaping out of a window)<br/><br/>Again, though, it's impotent criticism leveled at a game read and never tried. It's in the same way I can look at a D&amp;D 3.5 E handbook and say "No one who plays this game possibly roleplays (plays a role in character), because there's no rules for it in here. Most of the book is powerz and featz and combat attacks, manuvers, poisons, treasure, etc. Therefore no one acts in character in this game, instead focusing on the combat." A misnomer, to be sure, grounded in an interpretation based on reading the game and assuming play, rather than watching/playing for oneself.<br/><br/>Listening to a description of how the game Katamari Damacy works sounds like its the most retarded idea in the world, and totally unfun. Reading the rulebook, I can't imagine being entertained by this PS2 game for more then three minutes.  But all those imagined criticisms crumble to ash when you give it a shot, and find yourself 6 hours later like "Dammit, I'm gonna GET YOU, Brown Crayon!".<br/><br/>There's anime like that, books like that, movies like that, and apparently RPGs like that.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121587/#Comment_121587" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T17:01:48+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  5:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, well.

Partly because I hate the chapter by chapter reviews that are so popular nowadays, but mostly because he's very good at zeroing in on the interesting system bits.<br/><br/>Now, they aren't usually interesting to him, in my limited experience he usually hates them, but he breaks them down really well and gives me a great idea of what a game offers. Like, he points out that Contact can't be killed in, uh, Dread, which he hates, but sounds really cool to me. So, regardless of whether or not he hates it, he does point it out. <br/><br/>Now the final result is the most important bit. Do his reviews make me interested in games I wasn't interested in before? And, it's funny, but yeah they do. I wasn't interested in Dread before, but after reading his review and having him point system bits out that intrigued me (some of which he liked, and some of which he didn't), I became interested in, at the very least, reading the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121602/#Comment_121602" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T17:44:09+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  5:44PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Partly because I hate the chapter by chapter reviews that are so popular nowadays</blockquote>\nAh, you're right I hate the typical "chapter by chapter" review style as well, often common with RPGnet reviews.

I couldn't make it through that one. It was a positive review though, so maybe it's only the games he likes that he does the chapter by chapter for.<br/><br/>Oh, and disco on the formulaicness, and disco on chapter by chapter breakdowns lacking a big picture quality. But yeah, that formulaicness is a big snoozer for me. I just don't care enough to read a paragraph on the equipment chapter. I want to understand what does this game bring to the table system wise, what kind of setting/situation does this game take place in, and hopefully, when I combine those two, what kind of game will I be playing. I got a really good sense of that for Dread from RPGPundit's review (just had to go look up his name and, uh, seriously, is that what he calls himself? goodness), better than any other review I've seen.

The game was obviously not his cup of tea, but he did praise certain aspects of it. He liked the art, the demons, the Retirement rules, the quickstart rules, and much of the GM section.

If I were to have him review Story Engine, I'm fairly confident that he would hate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128817/#Comment_128817" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T16:58:24+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  4:58PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 5:01PM by Ogremarco.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>Yeah, couldja mebbe describe the cockroach cock a bit more?</blockquote>\nWell, for starters, it has a face.

But it's a kind of like Grandma watching a Slayer video and saying that those hippies sure are loud. She doesn't know the difference, it would take too long to explain, so you shrug and say what the hell. Yes, Granny, Woodstock was a crazy time.<br/><br/>Anyhow, Dread is one hundred percent metal. If it was a mix tape, it would feature Behemoth, Dark Tranquillity, Akercocke, and Bolt Thrower.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Yokiboy</cite>Hey Rafael, what's the seminal Dread movie?</blockquote>\nIn terms of mood/feel/tone, I'd say it's a toss-up between The Descent and Blade 2. Descent's got the human treachery and pettiness, plus some repulsive demons; Blade 2's got the gunfights, kung-fu, explosions, and kickass Reapers.<br/><br/>Most awesome part of Blade 2. If you watch the extras on the DVD, they show the evolution of Eli Damaskinos (ancient vampire, bald). One version of the character had long wispy hair with a receding hairline. Guillermo Del Toro is doing the commentary. "Jus look at thees focker," he chuckles. "Thees focker, he looks like Michael Bolton." It's hysterical.<br/><br/>Anyhow, other movies that are in the right ballpark:<br/>Slither: Awesome. Gross. Funny.<br/>Feast: Hilarious. Gross. Awesome.<br/>Dog Soldiers: Needs a sequel, like, yesterday.<br/>Night Watch: Could have used more monsters, but awesome nonetheless.<br/>The Black Dahlia: Dread minus the supernatural elements.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128915/#Comment_128915" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T21:29:52+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>And actually, I agree with him that game fiction = crap!</blockquote>\nHere's the thing: Not an attack, mind, but have you read Dread's game fic? If you think it's crap, that's totally fine with me and all. But for me, the game fiction in All Flesh Must Be Eaten, Dread, and 1/10 of Legend of the Five RIngs (1st edition) is some of the best stuff out there, I think.  Other fiction seems to fill spaces, to tell a story to evoke the setting (in far more pages than needed, usually). Like Exalted: Love the little incoherent comics, which flash you bits of the background and flavor. But the game fiction stories are dozens of pages long. <br/><br/>Dread, like AFMBE, is tight, fast, topical, and to the point. Evocative. It's a ladder, which just does just enough job of getting you to where you be, and does no more.<br/><br/>Not to like cream all over or anything, but yeah.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite><br/>Most awesome part of Blade 2.

I'd do this awesome technique and get out of ever being hit". As opposed to Blade, who takes a punch here and kick there to show he's badass yet vulnerable. Made me look at Seagal movies in a whole new way. A way that made me go "PYEEEEW!!!" (except for Marked For Death and Under Siege, because shit, right? They rocked).

My next nonfiction book will probably be self-published.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129111/#Comment_129111" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T10:14:16+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 10:14AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Non-fiction beeing?<br/>To be honest, I like Malignant Games.
