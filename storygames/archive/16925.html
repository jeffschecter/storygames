I really, REALLY like Bret Gillian's <a href="http://gasmaskgames.com/games/final-girl" rel="nofollow">The Final Girl</a>. However, it felt like it could use a bit of rules support for playing your group's characters to type. Then it struck me: I really, REALLY like Joe Mcdaldno's <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/keep-it-sunny/" rel="nofollow">Keep It Sunny</a>, too! So I basically stole the coin economy from Keep It Sunny and inserted it, kicking and screaming, into The Final Girl and here's what it turns out looking like, for those who know TFG:<br/><br/>When you create characters, instead of only a name and a trope-like description, also include a way of playing to type and a question, just like in Keep It Sunny. When they play to type (after the bloodbath scene), they get one Survivor Point, right then and there. One point max per scene <b>[EDIT]</b>, and these rules entirely replace the normal rules for gaining Survivor Points just for...you know, surviving scenes<b>[/EDIT]</b>. The question is something you should ask yourself when playing that character to help you get your Survivor Point. So it would look like this, using Lil' Kevin, Joe's example Guest Star, as a Final Girl character:<br/><br/>Name: Lil' Kevin, the slow-witted rapper.<br/>Take a Survivor Point when you survive a scene in which you cast doubt on your intelligence and capability.<br/>Don't Forget to Ask: What would a white rapper who lives with his mom do?<br/><br/>You could even share character creation, Like you write up your character's name and type, and the person to your right says how they get their points and the person to their right writes the question. I could see that being a lot of fun too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385531/#Comment_385531" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-21T13:47:14+00:00" title="July 21, 2012  1:47PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I like that!

Yeah, I'm talking about not getting any Survivor Points other than for playing to type. And you can still only get the one point per scene. So it forces you to play that character to the hilt a little more every scene they're in if you really wanna keep 'em alive. No idea why I assumed I wouldn't have to mention that in the OP. Lemme fix that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
