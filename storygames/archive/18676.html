But even after you know, it's still a very fine game. Indie Press Revolution has print copies again, even, and will have it in their booth at Gen Con.<br/><br/>What others have said in times that are not this time:<br/><br/>"Lacuna Part 1 is the first and only Cold War spy role-playing game.  It is, in my view, the best work from Memento-Mori by a considerable margin, and if you haven't been paying attention, that means I think it's one of the strongest RPGs in existence. But weaklings cannot play such a strong game. I didn't say it was friendly to people who pick it up on a lark and expect hand-holding to get through their bogus habits. They'll say, "Tee hee, the funny incomplete game," and revel in their ignorant edgy-ness. Fuck them. I'm talking about the game that you only might be man/woman enough to play, and that's not a joke." -- Ron Edwards (although that was before he wrote <i>Spione</i>)<br/><br/>"It's like paranoia and don't rest your head had a child that was abducted at birth and later showed up in a mysterious photograph associated with a string of unexplainable killings." -- Stephan Bretall<br/><br/>Lacuna opening: "The sky over the Blue City was the color of a dead metaphor." -- Carl Rigney<br/><br/>I also highly recommend <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> by the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419419/#Comment_419419" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T06:59:06+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  6:59AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a really meh experience with it.

My fear was that the game was kind of "empty", both system-wise as in setting/premise. But the more I read about it, the more I feel that, while it may actually have "empry spots" (some on purpose) it seems to have a strong mechano-conceptual punch towards a very specific (unique ?) premise that feels very exciting to me.    <br/><br/>By the way, still on the "emptiness" issue, its interesting to note that, while I tend to really like light games, there are a lot of them that feel empty for me, mechanically speaking. I came to appreciate more the games that are light, but also possess some substance in the form of clever and/or involving rules that go beyond of mere physical simulation/resolution. <br/><br/>Just so you know what Im talking about: Ive always been a fan of light games as Risus and Over the Edge, but the game I really fell in love with is Apocalypse World, exactly because it combines that lightness with a very interesting (for me) substance in the form of clever rules that help to convey in-game drama/tension and player-agency in a way that those games dont. <br/><br/>Well, dont know if I made myself clear here. My english is a bit rusted. xD                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419430/#Comment_419430" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T09:42:33+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  9:42AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran Lacuna for a campaign of about a dozen sessions.
