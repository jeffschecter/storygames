                    Well, it's a week too late but I made a list of my personal top ten favorite rpg/story game events &amp; accomplishments from last year. This is based on games I tried last year and is not intended to be anything so grand as a best-of-the-indie-scene list.<br/><br/>* favorite character: Jeff Tidwell's 'truck,' a kid in a session of Jim Pinto's game George's Children<br/>* favorite game design 'school': the Joshua &amp; Judson <b>free-flowing, non-turn-taking, pattern-recognition</b> school of design where players earn rewards for speaking up and pointing out certain connections between characters and other game elements, best exemplified by FLFS, Repetoire, and Sons of LIberty. Jim pointed out this tendency during a recent session. By the way, not all of Judson and Joshua's game are structured this way.<br/>* favorite published game I got to help playtest: Full Light Full Steam<br/>* favorite sign that I'm not a hopeless procrastinator: 'finishing' 6 games for contests in 06 (two for game chef, 1 for reverse engineer, and 3 for the 2 page challenge).<br/>* favorite design progress: finished play tests of all 9 games in the heads of state series. <br/>* Favorite game setting/situation: a Charles Fourier inspired utopian socialist commune/phalanxe In Space, in a FLFS game.<br/>* favorite 'design for my own personal preferences, the public be damned' accomplishment: writing a game based on urban psychogeography, phrenology, and Walter Benjamin<br/>* Favorite cool system stuff: tie between word swapping in Agora, escalation in dogs in the vineyard, the phases in repetoire &amp; george's children, Polaris' 'yes, but...' system, and the bill of rights/situation creation/ and mad libs set up of sons of liberty<br/>* Favorite game site: story games, I may not post all that much, but compared to my posting rate on rpg.net and the forge, I'm blazing away<br/>* favorite over all accomplishment: helping set up a regular playtest group a year ago<br/><br/>Oops- posted before I finished the last 2:                </div>

                            I'm going to assume you want others to chime in with theirs, because... well... I want to chime in with mine.<br/><br/>Favourite Character: Jordan, the self-obsessed just-out-of-the-closet senior in our Sorcerer game set in a suburban high school. His father forced him to join the track team, and he summoned a demon to help him win races and stay on the team (Game Face is the demon).<br/><br/>Favourite Game Design School: Definitely the Vancouver Game Design School of Kirk Mitchell and myself. Its members are: 18, living in Vancouver, designing really face-stabby games about emotional violence, designing games with single-word titles (Perfect [mine], Kin [Kirk], Boulevard [mine], Wash [collaboration])<br/><br/>Favourite Published Game I Got To Help Playtest: Hm... Excluding my own game, Perfect, I haven't been fortunate enough to playtest anything that fits this category yet. Ah... well... I'm new at this.<br/><br/>Favourite Sign that I'm Not A Hopeless Procrastinator: I took a game from initial idea to published product in several months, rising to my own (in retrospect, absurd) deadlines and production expectations.<br/><br/>Favourite Design Progress: Figuring out that Boulevard was about "characters without agency". When I came to that realization, everything started to really come together and lock down in my mind. Yay!<br/><br/>Favourite Game Setting/Situation: This is a hard one. I think my Shock game which involved "mind whoring" (allowing someone to plug their consciousness into your body/mind, and control you) and replication. It was like this sick, sadistic mess that lasted about 2 hours and had me and the other player like choking on how much awesome there was.<br/><br/>Favourite "design for my own preferences, the public be damned" accomplishment: Definitely Red-Rimmed Eyes, the game about a team of adventures whose insecurities and humanity tear them apart when they realize who the "real" monsters are. It was beautiful.<br/><br/>Favourite "cool system stuff": Keys. It rocks my socks, and it teaches me about playing in a new, better-than-ever way.<br/><br/>Favourite game site: The Forge. It connects me to the people I need to learn from, it helps me lift my ideas off the ground, and it allows me to give back to the community.<br/><br/>Favourite overall accomplishment: Going to Gencon with Perfect in hand.                        </div>

                            * favorite character:<br/><br/>(name forgotten, I'm always so bad with names) The Russian MGB rep in Cold City. It was challenging and fun to play up both cold and warmth, a good streak and downright cruel utilitarianism, etc.<br/><br/>* favorite game design 'school':<br/><br/>Haven't been paying too much attention to patterns this last year, so NA.<br/><br/>* favorite published game I got to help playtest:<br/><br/>...hmmm. Not published yet, but you can tell from my excitement that the new version of Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, which I help playtest late last year, is knocking my socks off.<br/><br/>* favorite sign that I'm not a hopeless procrastinator:<br/><br/>I put about $500 into outsourcing Tenra Bansho translations for sections that, if I were doing it all alone, would have taken me forever to get through. Also, have made some pretty heavy statements about releasing the game this year, almost exactly 10 years after the release of the original version of the game in Japan.<br/><br/>* favorite design progress:<br/><br/>hmmmm. NA<br/><br/>* Favorite game setting/situation:<br/><br/>This last year has been all about me rediscovering old-school play and having a blast with it. So I'm going to go with the lateral answer of "Generic System; Homemade Setting". Taking a generic-ish game without a built-in situation or super-defined setting and jigging in your own.<br/><br/>But maybe I'll also add Mark's Burning Wheel Lankhmar game: We ran a few-session thieves' guild game, which was brutal but in a good way.<br/><br/>* favorite 'design for my own personal preferences, the public be damned' accomplishment:<br/><br/>That was setting the theme of last year's Game Chef contest (with the time constraint and all).  This year, we're going back to Old School.<br/><br/>* Favorite cool system stuff:<br/><br/>Art Grace and Guts: I liked the "I Owe" list, and how that sets who does and doesn't come back for further games. Makes for a really unique gaming experience.<br/><br/>* Favorite game site:<br/><br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/y6jz62" rel="nofollow">Doctor Braintree's Esteemed Gaming-Relational Web Resource</a><br/><br/>* favorite over all accomplishment:<br/><br/>Getting Tenra Bansho into a state where it can be played. That was one major hurdle, a few more to go!                        </div>

                            Favorite character: A tax collector I played in HeroQuest.

Holmes and Watson. Was that in 2006?<br/>Favorite sign that I'm not a hopeless procrastinator: I ran some LARPs.<br/>Favorite design progress: I really enjoyed designing that Meat Loaf LARP. After a drive listening to Meat Loaf, I posted a quick query asking for jokey Meat Loaf-based mechanics. After a few threads, all of which were astonishingly fun and off-the-wall, the game was done.<br/>Favorite game setting/situation: Marcus Rowland's modern-world-as-though-it-was-a-future-television-series setting for Elvis: The Legendary Journeys.<br/>* favorite 'design for my own personal preferences, the public be damned' accomplishment: Everything so far about The Gay Recruitment Squad Wants YOU!<br/>* Favorite cool system stuff: The character generation in Best Friends.<br/>* Favorite game site: Story Games, mainly because of the Meat Loaf design above. However, I look at the Forge archives a lot, and they're incredibly useful for answering questions.<br/>* favorite over all accomplishment: Negotiating trips to "geek conventions" (as she calls them) with the girlfriend.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I'm going to be a rebel break the "favorite" mold and just list things I'm happy about.  In 2006...<br/><br/>I played a nine town Dogs in the Vineyard campaign.  To my knowledge that's a record.<br/>I played a five episode Primetime Adventures season arc.  First time I'd played a whole season and I was happy with the results.<br/>I played an amazing Southern Gothic Sorcerer game that finally felt like "I got it right" when playing Sorcerer.<br/>The above three are significant because I promised myself I wouldn't compromise anymore on my gaming interests in 2006 and the above demonstrate that I stuck to it all year long.<br/><br/>I finished a solid playtest draft of Silent Sound (my Silent Hill inspired RPG) that I"m actually very very happy with as a first pass.<br/><br/>There you have it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            2006 was kind of a shabby year for gaming for me, since I didn't have any gaming opportunities for half the year.<br/><br/>High points would include playing HeroQuest with Mike Holmes on very short notice. Through "open secrets" play,  I got to pull off the most satisfying of a long line of dickweed characters here.                        </div>

                            I had a great gaming year in 2006 because of:<br/>
<br/>
<b>1. New games published:</b> <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.firefly-games.com/" rel="nofollow">Faerie's Tale</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.atomicsockmonkey.com/products/zoz.asp" rel="nofollow">The Zantabulous Zorcerer of Zo</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.firebird-productions.com/" rel="nofollow">Mythic Russia</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.exilegames.com/" rel="nofollow">Hollow Earth Expedition</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.evilhat.com/dryh.php" rel="nofollow">Don't Rest Your Head</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.change-works.com/sb/questers/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Questers of the Middle Realm</a></i>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. "Old" games discovered:</b> <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/princval.html" rel="nofollow">Prince Valiant</a>, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.heliograph.com/space1889/" rel="nofollow">Space: 1889</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wicked-dead.com/cat/" rel="nofollow">Cat</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://mutantsandmasterminds.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></i>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3. Lots of indie games I tried for the first time:</b> <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/" rel="nofollow">Dogs in the Vineyard</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/" rel="nofollow">Capes!</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.memento-mori.com/octane/" rel="nofollow">octaNe</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.atomicsockmonkey.com/products/tj.asp" rel="nofollow">Truth &amp; Justice</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://bayn.org/wushu/" rel="nofollow">Wushu</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.burningempires.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Burning Empires</a>,</i> and the aforementioned <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.atomicsockmonkey.com/products/zoz.asp" rel="nofollow">Zorcerer of Zo</a></i>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>4. Best Actual Play I participated in:</b> <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=302189" rel="nofollow">Crisis on the Island of Forgotten Toys!</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>5. Great players, great people</b> in both regular gaming groups I'm involved with as well as in the club meetings.<br/>
<br/>
<b>6. I compiled <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.tlucretius.net/RPGs/kids.html" rel="nofollow">info on RPGs for kids</a></b> that was added as an appendix to the new book by Sandy Antunes et al., <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.technomancerpress.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=9" rel="nofollow">Roleplaying with Kids</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>7. I helped put together a successful gaming event</b>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Emerald_City_Gamefest" rel="nofollow">Emerald City Gamefest</a>.  I would never do it again the same way (the organizing part, that is), but the result was very good and I was part of the reason.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<b>8. I also helped organize the local game club</b> where I was lucky enough to play on lots of <b>great</b> games on a weekly basis, and I put together <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Seattle_Gamers_Assemble%21" rel="nofollow">some archives</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>9. Favourite game site:</b> More and more this consists of the list of blogs I subscribe too.  I'm getting disillusioned about forums and mailing lists.<br/>
<br/>
<b>10. Helped flesh out <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Story_Games_by_Title" rel="nofollow">the Story Games wiki</a></b>.<br/>
