This allowed us to randomly find out where we where, where we were going, where people came from, and so on. It also gave us an instant teaser on the place so that our creative juices are kickstarted<br/>\n3) a deck of Inciting Incidents such as 'A Desperate Phone Call', 'Lights in the Sky' and so on. This gave us the spur to action, and provided additional kicks whenever we got stuck. These were based on the lists in The Instant Game<br/>\n4) a deck of specific locations such as, ''Frontier Outpost', Immense Cavern', and so on. This helped us find the next scene<br/>\n5) the Mythic games Master Emulator. We use this consistently to generate the answers to yes/no questions and to get deep motivations<br/>\n6) Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. We use this to get character names and for quirky events and motivations. This is our 'Out of the Box' generator<br/>\n<br/>\nI have written more about these tools here, if anyone is interested: http://shichitenhakki.wordpress.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nComments welcome.<br/>\nAndrew                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311276/#Comment_311276" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T15:50:15+00:00" title="February  5, 2011  3:50PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds wonderful.

We started by drawing an Inciting Incident card. It was Brainwashing. Then a location, Barter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then read little about Barter. It is a desert planet with no native intelligence, but was instead a lawless trader town. This put us in the mind of Tatooine from Star Wars so we described the place to each other for a while, picking out buildings and sounds and smells and talking about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in good practice with this now so we comfortably take turns in describing something, and listening. The trick here is to really hold yourself back from trying to describe every little thing in a monologue. You have to take turns, and accept what the other fellow adds. For example, I described a long dusty street, with skimmer cars slowly passing through like hoods checking the place, shrouded men with long guns, smelly and bellowing beasts, everyone armed and wary. Greg then looked over the rooftops and described the shapes and colours of the buildings. And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we had a feel for the place we asked ourselves who we were. Another location card indicated Vitin, the pirate stronghold. So we were pirates, we concluded. Then we spent a little time describing ourselves, how we looked and walked and how were dressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we knew who we were and where we were. We still did not know yet what we had to do with Brainwashing. Here we flapped back and forward hypotheses about it. We were here to buy. We were here to sell. We were spies. None of these really sat well so we decided to move on. A minor location card told us we were on an airship - so we concluded that we had parked our rocket at the main hangar out of town and were on our way by public ship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we described the interior of the airship in the same too and fro way. By this time we had a good feeling for what to expect from people on this world, and what sort of world it was. Spies were everywhere, we agreed. We were probably being spied on right now. Why were we being spied on? Because we had a secret.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key thing is to consciously stop from 'owning' everything and describing everything. Describe one thing: a building, a room, a man or a device, and then shut up. Let the other guy describe one thing and then incorporate what he said into the picture. Because there is no plot until we uncover it together. There is no scenario until the game is over and the whole canvass is complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tend to find a lot of mysteries in this kind of play. We don't know what is where or why it is happening. So we hypothesise, "Maybe the something or other is a whatnot," and explore that for a while. Often, several of these hypotheses will be tested and rejected, "No. I don't think so, because wasn't the so-and-so interested in it before?" eventually we get a model that we both are comfortable with, and it becomes fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen in doubt, and we often hit brick walls, we use ink-blot style random ideas from Mythic, Brewer's, encyclopaedias, art books and so on. Anything just to get the stalled juices flowing again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311318/#Comment_311318" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T00:33:21+00:00" title="February  6, 2011 12:33AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bottlesorter</cite>The key thing is to consciously stop from 'owning' everything and describing everything.

But its question/results feel pitched at a slightly higher level than we wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the question, "Why are we in this city?". Mythic random might give Refuse Wounds. This is evocative of something, but it is a little more abstract than ,"Investigate a murder".<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use the Mythic chart to give higher level feelings and moods. Motivations, and so on. We use our Inciting Incident deck to find out what is the driver 'right now', if you see what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nDwellers of the Forbidden City?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have not come back to it yet. The first couple of sessions were only marginally acceptable. This was because it came out as a largely tactical miniatures game, with little opportunity for narrative (story telling) play. As such the game ran something like, "Miniatures run into room, monsters appear, lots of dice get rolled, miniatures run into next location."

Which is fine, that's what it was designed to do. But somewhere along the way we lost track of both interesting tactical problems AND challenging role-playing options getting instead the worst of both worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI built the card decks. There are two: the first is a very specific location, such as Graveyard, Docks, Hospital. The second deck describes something specific that happens there, such as, Plane Crash, Raging Fire, Desperate Phone Call.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is that these are specific scene starters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deck is still under review. Not all entries work. There are currently 96 entries in each deck: so 16 cards in each deack, with each card having 6 entries.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316625/#Comment_316625" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T16:56:34+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  4:56PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a bit lost I'm afraid.<br/><br/>So, like a location card has the main location, then six locations within it and you choose randomly?<br/><br/>And the specific event deck works the same way, but the entries are some sort of variation on the event?<br/><br/>(Man this sounds like such a good concept and I'm totally going to steal it)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bottlesorter" title="bottlesorter"><img alt="bottlesorter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bottlesorter">bottlesorter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316653/#Comment_316653" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T21:02:21+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  9:02PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just put six different locations on each card, which you select with a d6. There is no relationship between the locations on each location card - it's random. <br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with Incidents on another deck. No relationship between the incidents on each card.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for doing it that way was to simply economise on cards - it was excessive to have 96 Location or Incident cards with only one line on them. Fun to shuffle and deal, maybe. But otherwise a waste. In fact a big table would do just as well. I just happen to like cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the procedure, when starting a scene, is to draw a location card from the deck and roll d6. That entry is where the action is happening. Then draw an Incident card and roll d6 - that's why you are at that particular location at this particular time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally you would spend some time developing the story about how this event and location tie into the preceeding scene, and/or the big picture of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316672/#Comment_316672" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T06:56:14+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  6:56AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2011 6:58AM by komradebob.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having seen them now, yeah, it makes a bunch of sense.

At that point you either make it permanent and regularly occuring so much that it's an important part of the setting, or you erase it and put something else in ts slot).<br/><br/>Very, very nifty stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bottlesorter" title="bottlesorter"><img alt="bottlesorter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bottlesorter">bottlesorter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316737/#Comment_316737" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T13:45:27+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  1:45PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since they are home made stickers on cheap cards, I write straight on them.

It had nothing to do with the map, or my preparations.<br/><br/>I were not up to my best that day, and forgot all about the tools I've developed, that we were supposed to test in this particular game. So I led the players into the game in a way that did not support the kind of fiction I wanted, and so we had a lame game, very much like any other ordinary fantasy-game with no scenario at hand; no direction of play and frustrated players. It was a very simple mistake, that I do not normally make, but there you have it. We are as good as our last game ...<br/><br/>It was meant to be a mini-campaign, but I cut it short. No use in following up on game-play that is faulty from the start.<br/><br/>At the moment I've gone into heavy rewrite of the game again, and that has set a stop to further play-testing, for the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
