Jason Morningstar's Last Train reminded me of this, and I'm looking for any advice that you folks might have on doing this.<br/><br/>What I'm specifically looking for are one-shot scenario building concepts/general advice, with the additional restriction that the thing be self-contained rules-wise. That is, it is not meant to be a scenario for another game, and the participants are not assumed to be familiar with any specific rules systems-it all needs to be in their handouts or pre-play instructions.<br/><br/>A few things I have noted that seem to help:<br/>A few very short mechanical rules that cover lots of ground.<br/><br/>Pregen characters that are to be interpretted by the players, rather than built from the ground up.<br/><br/>A starting situation that also gives some cue as to an ending state as well<br/><br/>Action seems to focus more on the characters and their interactions, and is purpose built that way, than outside events<br/><br/>Pregen characters often have internally inconsistent goals, probably to allow the player maximum freedom to choose what to pursue in game, while still having some common thread<br/><br/>Pregens also seem to have a bunch of love/hate connections with the other characters, or intersecting goals that require some decision-making/compromise/sacrifice of wants+goals<br/><br/>The characters are put into a relatively constrained situation that is not easily wandered away from<br/><br/>What else is there?<br/><br/>The floor is open.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246994/#Comment_246994" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T21:09:24+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  9:09PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2009 9:11PM by J_Walton.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd look at everything John Harper's doing right now, especially Danger Patrol and Lady Blackbird.  The entire purpose of them is to do quickstart play in a serious way.<br/><br/>With Danger Patrol he's got modular characters that you create by slapping a few concepts together.  Pick one of X and one of Y, bam!  Check a few boxes, bam!  Your character is ready to go.<br/><br/>You have a super-quick brainstorming session where you get the players give you some clues about what they want to see.  (He calls this: "Last Time On...")  The GM writes these down and then makes them happen later on, during play. See also: the trailer in Geiger Counter.<br/><br/>You start with a bang, a situation that everybody has to jump in to. This initial situation also gets right into the meat of the mechanics, so you can learn how to play right off the bat. (This happens in both DP and Blackbird; but also in Dogs initiation scenes).<br/><br/>There are very explicit GM guidelines for how to set up situations.  Do one of these and two of these.  And maybe one of those.  See also: Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>There are very explicit ways in which previous scenes / situations evolve into new scenes and situations.  After this happens, then do that.  This is critical, since it's not just the first scene that's important; it's where you go from there. See also <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11074" rel="nofollow">GM Keys</a>.<br/><br/>On the players' side, looking down at your character sheet, there are immediate things that show you what your character can / should do.  "I totally deploy my robot's detachable flying head."  Or "I'm totally holding this love letter I wrote for Lady Blackbird, crumpled in my hand, since I can't give it to her, hitting my Key of Unrequited Love."<br/><br/>Everything is streamlined to the point that there is nothing to get in the way of awesome things happening.  You can't invoke a mechanic and have it be a bad tactical decision.  Failures don't suck.  Anything you might do is potentially a great choice.<br/><br/>There are other games out there that aim to do this stuff, including some of mine, but John's currently, like Wolverine, the best there is at what he does.  At least until I rip the adamantium from his bones with a giant magnet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246998/#Comment_246998" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T22:04:22+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 10:04PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With Ribbon Drive, my road trip game, the formula is:<br/><br/>1.) Before play, we summarize where we are going and why.<br/><br/>2.) We make it clear that this is a plot driver, but not the point.<br/><br/>3.) The point is to let go of your (character's) hang-ups and expectations.<br/><br/>4.) There are no mechanical barriers to that, no voting for it, no process that must be undergone except "when your character has let go of a Future, cross it off." Endgame is triggered by crossing off both of your Futures. Theoretically, that could happen in a matter of minutes. So, the game is about building up to this thing, and then having it happen. Straightforward, and the timing is controllable by anyone.<br/><br/><br/>In summary: having a roadmap in place for external events (no pun intended, but in this case it's a literal roadmap), having a clear understanding of the session goals and structure, and having the ability to "hit endgame" be immediately accessible to everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246999/#Comment_246999" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T22:12:28+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 10:12PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff!<br/><br/>Yeah, Lady Blackbird really struck a chord with me, although I see it as a bit more open-ended than I was really thinking, mostly due to a lack of Endgame/off-switch built in. It definitely has all the preliminary situation in place though.<br/><br/>I wasn't familiar with Ribbon Drive, but from the description, I like both that it contains an off-switch and sounds very straight forward mechanically ( simpolicity/very clear methods seem key to these kinds of things).<br/><br/>I noticed that both you folks mentioned some kind of pre-game building as a group in some form with both Ribbon Drive and Danger Patrol. How would you rate that stuff? I ask mostly because I'd been envisioning stuff where there was some more pre-game work done in building starting characters (more like LB) and then the players jump in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247022/#Comment_247022" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T03:18:43+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  3:18AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it's always good to get players on the same page. Coming together to put detail into the situation is great way to do this IMO. Everyone around the table is likely to bring something and the group can zero in on a common wavelength so to speak.<br/><br/>For characters, I'm kinda fond of the "pick &amp; choose" thing, if it's applicable (like choosing traits in Panty Explosion, Aspects in Fate, keys/secrets in Solar System, etc.) I the character needs 5 of them, well supply 8 or even 10. A compromise between full character creation and complete pregen. Choosing this kind of stuff can take some time so, don't leave too many things to decide. Maybe this is also more suitable for an "open-ended" game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247031/#Comment_247031" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T05:59:31+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  5:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the transhumanist science fiction game that Joshua A.

SUPER simple system:<br/>* Every PC had a small tin (like an Altoids tin) of hand-made cards.<br/>* Each card was a single-use "trump" in a conflict:<br/>-- If you could take a plausible action that used the card, you trumped the other person and won the conflict.<br/>-- That person could try to trump back, using one of his or her cards.<br/>-- Back and forth until someone gives or the participants decide not to use anymore cards (a tie).<br/>* Every PC had two goals and a relationship to another PC (maybe two relationships and a goal, for some--I didn't see them all).<br/><br/>In advance, we were all given an overview of our PCs--I was a sort of "impossible, weird science" professor--and some advice on costuming for the character and period (1930s), and set loose. It worked... fabulously. Basically a freeform narration system with each PC having a handful of chances to really shine, using trumps. Note also that this friend had never (and has never) read any "story games" or forum, yet he basically channeled DitV Traits, Keys, and similar SG techniques, as well as a sort of Jeepform approach (the freeform, do-what's-logical-or-right approach to "rules") before having ever heard of Jeep.<br/><br/>For a while, there was talk of marketing these "scenarios" as decks of cards, but this was a bit before POD card printing (or even affordable small-press runs). Sometime, oh, 1998ish?

I'd never run Poison'd with pregenerated characters: it's important that your character is <i>your guy</i>.<br/><br/>What's good about Poison'd is that character generation is fun and fast. (I've done it in ten minutes, using tick-box style sheets instead of real character sheets).<br/><br/>Steal Away Jordan's the same. It's a perfect one-shot, but you've <i>got</i> to create your slave. What's good about that is, although character generation is a little prolonged (especially when you're discussing goals), it's great fun, especially when the GM names you and also when the GM goes out of the room and you decide your goals.<br/><br/>Having said that, there are many games that don't conform to that list of points. Dungeons and Dragons is a <i>perfect</i> one shot, but breaks a lot of the rules above. Trail of Cthulhu works well for me as a one shot, but doesn't have relationship maps and depends greatly on external events. The common factor is that everyone knows what they're meant to be doing.<br/><br/>I'd argue a GM-figure is pretty essential for a successful one shot.

It has the instructions for the guy who "brings the game to the group" written in the form of "at this point I usually do this and that" etc. It helped my to organize my first session of Geiger Counter.<br/><br/>Here's an example, from the initial scene instructions:<br/><i>"If I\u2019m the one organizing a game of Geiger Counter, I often take a strong hand in crafting the prelude, to help set the tone, but if someone else has a really great idea for how to open the movie, I almost always pass off to them."</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247270/#Comment_247270" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T07:01:59+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  7:01AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 7:16AM by komradebob.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that personal advice bit Antti.

It seems to me that there's a sort of hole or something that I can vaguely make out the shape of, but can't quite perceive, gamer culture-wise.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>I'll try to be slightly less obscure by way of examples.<br/><br/>When I look at a couple of key Call of Cthulhu adventures, most notably In Media Res and John Wick's Curse of the Yellow Sign pt1, I see very self-contained game scenarios that are really interesting in themselves. Buuuuut...they're tied mechanically into CoC. Not a terrible thing in itself ( for me anyway; I lurve me some CoC), but they seem so self contained that I'm wondering what they would have been had they only existed wholly of themself, and with an eye towards the sort of real-world play situation restrictions I've mentioned.<br/><br/>Also, to give a little backdrop into why I'm asking this, it's part of a general line of thinking I've been having about games ( a thing you bust open and play) versus rulebooks/systems/toolkits. It seems like our hobby generally favors the second one as a product and I think it has a weird impact on accessibilty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247329/#Comment_247329" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T10:58:55+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 10:58AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird being a notable exception, right?

Until lately, that's a pricey product (and even still is, with stuff like LLTK or even WHFRPG3E). And if it's a REALLY tightly wound situation with vibrant characters... how many replays can one expect, in exchange for the purchase price?<br/><br/>Systems/toolkits have modularity and, thus, replayability, as the bits and levers and bobs are mixed and matched and reused and repurposed. And yet, such toolkits can ALSO be "tuned" for a fast one-shot, using the techniques in this thread. So for the same kind of money (or less, or sometimes, sure, more--LBB is a LOT cheaper than D&amp;D 4E) you get both kinds of experiences. Kind of obvious which would be more marketable.<br/><br/>(Which is why, BTW, my buddy wanted to make "decks"--he was envisioning a "booster pack" style of distribution model, where a full game--characters, item and ability cards, situation setup--could be sold like a booster of Magic cards, for maybe $10 tops. Around THAT price point--$10 for a game 10 folks can play all night--you've got something more "disposable" and, hopefully, more likely to get repeat sales.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247345/#Comment_247345" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T11:50:09+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 11:50AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2009 11:50AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>And if it's a REALLY tightly wound situation with vibrant characters... how many replays can one expect, in exchange for the purchase price?</blockquote>\nHard to imagine a situation more constrained than Montsegur 1244 and it never gets old.

Rotate characters, emphasize different character elements, and what-not. I'll also, obviously, agree that a one-shot can be played over and over again with different groups.<br/><br/>But I'd like to hear more about how such constrained situations can provide replayability without, for instance, having multiple options (traits, toggles, whatever) for portraying a character or establishing the situation(s). For instance, <i>Long Live the King</i> has replayability--even if you play the same role--because, for each role, there are at least two other roles with agendas that motivate them to form early game alliances with it. Seven characters to the power of two (I think, to calculate all possible initial parings) makes for a lot of replay. The initial conditions can tilt a variety of ways, and the Butterfly Effect then ensures that the subsequent game plays with a different feel and outcome than an earlier game.<br/><br/>So I'd GUESS that M1244 has at least some variety of character or situation elements, be they character traits or motivations to emphasize or initial conditions of the situation that quickly bifurcate from player choices to form alternate plot lines and conclusions.

Grab four people crack the thing open, read the rules a bit and play. That's the thing being sold. That's the game.<br/><br/>Now, Fiasco as we know it, that still exists. Or at least Jason has it. Or parts of it.<br/><br/>Let's say that somehow, ABG&amp;B gets a following. Jason can still put out other games like it. In fact, maybe he does. Maybe there's a real following that develops and folks demand sequels or stuff in a similar vein.<br/><br/>The Fiasco we know, well, what does he do with it?<br/><br/>I don't know. Release it later? Give it away? Put it up online for the folks who want to try their hand at designing similar games? I mean, tool kits are a bit for the expert or interested hobbyist or whatever from this perspective I'm positing/<br/><br/>And yeah, I know that what I'm poking at is bass-akwards from the current reality, but the current rreality is a child of, to some degree both tradition, money concerns and technology. With the changes in tech possibilities though, I wonder if this might make sense in a different way.<br/><br/>As for how much to sell ABG&amp;B for? No clue. How much would you spend on a book or pdf you might use only once? My figuring is about the price of a paperback novel, but who knows.? Anybody know how much Lulu charges to make something about on par with those old-time saddle stitched D&amp;D modules? Or how much Roanoke costs to the maker per unit?<br/><br/>So why do something like that at all?<br/><br/>Well, maybe you do have some core system concept you'll be re-using, but maybe not, too. One-shot, self contained---you just write what you need for that and walk away.<br/><br/>Or, maybe, you have a cool setting that people dig, but there are lots of different approaches to the setting. Instead of banging together the rules that cover all of those things, you have multiple short self-contained games set there. The rules of the games don't need to be cross game consistent particularly.<br/><br/>Off-loading the work. Those of us who incessantly tinker with systems and hack them will do it no matter what anyway. Maybe we don't really need tool kits, despite the tradition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247380/#Comment_247380" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T13:30:55+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  1:30PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Robert, I'm seeing what you're saying about a product at a paperback's price point--that's the very notion of "disposable game" I mentioned as an aside a couple of posts ago. And, as with my buddy's basic system (called <i>Portraits</i>, FWIW), the "core system toolkit" isn't ever a product. One might not even ever WANT it to be a product, as that kills the steady stream of revenue from disposable products and opens the door to competing free products (e.g. hacks, modules, etc).<br/><br/>But aren't there SOME companies that basically do this? For instance, take Hero Clix or Descent (two current favs of mine):<br/>* Both have a "core system" or "toolkit" used by the games' designers to create the actual products of booster packs and expansion sets.<br/>* The core math is (somewhat) guarded, so that it's tough to make one's own balanced dials (in HC) or make a new monster type or dungeon crawl (in D). (In the case of Descent, though, they DO have rough-and-ready tools to help you do that, because they are in the business of selling plastic and card stock, not "game rules.")<br/><br/>One could even argue that WoD games or even GURPS do this as well. Now, GURPS *does* have a "core rule system" but it's my understanding that it doesn't actually allow for anything and everything (unlike, say, Hero System)--for that, you buy setting books. WoD has a "core system," but they actually sell splatbooks and standalone settings, not core rules with procedures for making supernatural races and their weaknesses and drives--for that, you buy Vamp or Werewolf or Mage or Changeling.<br/><br/>Heck, even the Burning stuff sits on a fundamental framework, with actual products ""genre-binding" that framework to specific settings, often with specific, new systems to better simulate the tone, genre, time period, technology, or what-not. I'd even argue that DitV and IaWA, with all the myriad drifted settings and new Oracles, are "core systems" that are sold with a "genre-bound" wrappings that play right out of the box--The West that Never Was or Sword, Sex, and Sorcery--but which are just as often filed off to make way for different settings, genres, and even tones. (I've even been on threads where we've tried to boil out the DitV core system and make "meta-procedures" for setting creation--what the sin and escalation progressions should be, different color for stats, alternate justifications for the PCs' moral authority, and even what the meaning of Demonic Influence and Sorcery drifts into being.)<br/><br/>Anyhow... I might be speaking cross-purposes--I'm have a Bad Text Day, it would seem. But if I am reading you right, there's a lot of game product out there that is sold "complete, self-contained, and ready to play" but is nevertheless built off of a core system that we would recognize as a toolkit RPG (or at least a toolkit game, WRT Descent).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247387/#Comment_247387" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T13:47:24+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  1:47PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert, Harper is way ahead of you, I suspect, thinking along similar paths.

I mean, collectively it's still the model of how things are done, and the reliable market segment of hobbyists expect that is how things work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247395/#Comment_247395" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T14:11:09+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  2:11PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Robert, Harper is way ahead of you, I suspect, thinking along similar paths.
