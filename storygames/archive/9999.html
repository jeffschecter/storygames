There were three missions, including: <br/><br/>A trip to a historical museum, largely devoid of strange happenings save for a few [CLASSIFIED]<br/>A trek to a hospital in heavy rain, some strange elevators, far too many floors, strange sounds, spidermen, the girl, and blue cities first sunrise<br/>A train ride to a school, an encounter with a strange tank, a dangerous border zone, false communications, and many lit explosives<br/><br/>I used music to set the mood, which i think helped a lot. On someone's recommendation from way back when I did a "music for lacuna" thread (can't find the link, sorry) I used <a href="http://www.colleenplays.org/SOUNDS/Player_LP01.swf" rel="nofollow">this excellently creepy music</a>  as well as some other stuff (some nine inch nails, instrumentals). I had a track for general blue city happenings, then specific tracks I'd loop during key events. <br/><br/>The players seemed to react well to all the rules, and the heart rate rules worked perfectly to pace them. I used poker chips of different colors as commendation points, which were received as normal except for a couple of strange ones I gave them that they didn't know what to do with. <br/><br/>I enacted a policy that worked out really well, which is "there is no metagame" -Not everything was in character, but the players out of character actions did impact the game- because I set one of the static conditions as "the players disrupt the game with a side conversation or something similar", of course I didn't tell them about any of thew static conditions- or even that there was static (as a mechanic, the static got plenty of in-game mention)<br/><br/>Since one of the players was constantly doing stuff like that, the static built up at a good rate- we hit 15 in the first mission, but it went up to 26 and 25 in the second and third missions- which was quite fun. I have to say that static is quite possibly one of my favorite mechanics ever.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great game, plenty of actual psychological horror, which was cool because normally I don't play RPGs that can provoke such a good response in such a short period of time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221927/#Comment_221927" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T10:06:57+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 10:06AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite> I set one of the static conditions as "the players disrupt the game with a side conversation or something similar", of course I didn't tell them about any of thew static conditions- or even that there was static (as a mechanic, the static got plenty of in-game mention)<br/></blockquote>\nThis is great!

From this I came up with a some hostile personalities, regular personalities, and locations of interest. I also found some old photos I printed out, and made some weird mysterious notes to use as handouts.<br/>We did all three missions in one big marathon session, and my previous lacuna sessions were all no-prep, so that's really all I can say about that.<br/> <br/>2) I mostly just came up with the events on the fly from things I either thought would be creepy or sometimes stuff I had thought up a bit in advance. Every time the static went up, I'd do an event as suggested by the guidelines in the book. So at 1-10 static, it'd mostly be something sort of weird, like a hallway that's far too long, or spiders where there shouldn't be, or an encounter with a normal personality. At 11-20 static, an encounter with the hostile personality, encounters with other agents, or seriously weird shit would be in order. At 21+ static, things get weird fast. I usually have the event triggered by static <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2321&amp;Mode=like">#21</a> be "spidermen arrive", and every spiderman raises the static even more, allowing for more serious weirdness.<br/><br/>The hospital adventure started with the group at a train station in heavy rain. Puddles that were ten feet deep littered the area, and they had a few block walk to get to the hospital to track the HP, known as the "angel of death", she was a nurse who was a serial child murderer. They went along, and a huge group of robed figures blocked the sidewalk. Two of them decided to go around, which landed them in the street, which was almost like a river from all the rain. One of them was narrowly saved by his teammate from being swept down a storm drain. <br/><br/>They sort of split up once they got to the hospital- some stayed behind to try and get guns (which control then told them to dispose of for risk of contamination), one decided to tail a woman wearing a veil who left the hospital (in case it was the HP), and the other agents went inside and talked with a man in a straight jacket, who seemed to have escaped from higher floors of the hospital.<br/><br/> Eventually they got up to where the HP was (the 45th floor in a 15 story building), found a strange note, riddled the HP with tons of bullets before she had a chance to act and ran away from a stomping noise. They got to the roof of the building, narrowly avoiding three spidermen, who were walking towards them, only to see the sun, with a silhouette of the girl against it.  They were afraid of her, especially once the sun became a black hole and reality started being erased, but what was really creepy for them was that when they were on the roof not knowing what to do, the hatch they had climbed through to get to the roof opened and this child they had rescued earlier (and that they had left down on the first floor) just came up and started asking them questions-at this point everyone's heart rate was so high that they knew any action would be dangerous, so they were kind of panicked as to what to do.<br/><br/>So yeah, I just sort of improvised based on the static guidelines and what I thought would be creepy/tension building for the area. <br/><br/>One of the really cool things I've found with Lacuna though is that the thought of something being threatening is enough to drive the characters to action. What I love about that game is that by the rules, nothing save a failed risky action can actually hurt the characters- they cause all the trouble for themselves by jacking up their heart rate. <br/><br/>I did introduce small things (I had someone shoot a player without them failing once, I had talking with the girl raise everyone's heartrate by like three dice), but especially with the spidermen, part of the thing I always have with them is that they just want to talk (although they do have guns- and when they fire at things, those things DIE, only they never fire at the players- but the thought that they could is what adds to the horror, well that and the players not knowing what the spidermen want. The ideal situation I like is that the players know that a lot of different things are around, and quite possibly very dangerous, but have little, no, or conflicting information on what those things are (what's black clearance? what's wine clearance? what's with the spidermen? what's with the girl? what's with control? who knows?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222026/#Comment_222026" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T07:38:51+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  7:38AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2009 7:39AM by Yokiboy.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff Stephen.
