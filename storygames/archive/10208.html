But for some strange historic reasons I am now writing a comedy game. <br/><br/>Rpg:s focussed on comedy is certainly not common, and for a good reason, I believe. But now I am finishing one and it would be interesting to get some perspective from other people on comedy gaming. The only rpg with a large portion of intentional comedy that I have played is Paranoia. In a different thread someone pointed out Ghostbusters and Toon as other examples. (In this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8774&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Distance and Comedy</a>thread.)<br/><br/>First of all, are there any comedy oriented games in the indie-production? Any noteworthy discussions on the subject?<br/><br/>Second, dos and don'ts for designing comedy? <br/><br/>One thing that I see as an obvious problem (it is with our game, for sure) is that if you have a game mainly focussed on comedy you might get too distanced to the characters. It starts out as really fun, but since you never get connected to the characters and because of this won't enjoy specific jokes and ideas as much as you would if, say, the same joke had been done in a more serious game with heartfelt connection to the characters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226661/#Comment_226661" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T07:39:23+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  7:39AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/games/unstore/game/12" rel="nofollow">It's Complicated</a> is designed as a comedy-drama game, but tends to get played as high farce.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8774" rel="nofollow">This conversation in distance and comedy</a> is one of the most useful and interesting threads I've read on SG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226665/#Comment_226665" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T08:02:45+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  8:02AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A previous, related, thread you might want to look over: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2039" rel="nofollow">Humour</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226674/#Comment_226674" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T08:29:44+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  8:29AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth, <br/><br/>The distance-thread I linked to above (although without really understanding how to do it properly, it seems).

If the rules don't support comedy, then it's not a comedy game. It might be funny to read and it might be funny when you play it, but that's all on the players' skills as entertainers.

Sorensen</cite>Any game can be played for laughs. If the rules don't support comedy, then it's not a comedy game.</blockquote>\nSo what kind of rules support comedy?  I know of several games that I've played for laughs, but thinking back on it I'm not sure if any of them specifically supported the humor in their rules.  At least, not in any way that doesn't also support most other moods you'd choose to play them in.<br><br>-Greg<br><br><br>Paranoia is funny because it's so awful (in a moral sense not in a design sense). It's black comedy, satirical and wicked. Played in the Zap! style, it's more like a Warner Bros. cartoon and is only funny if your group is funny.<br/><br/>Elfs is funny because you can hate your character and work against his or her goals (which are petty and stupid and selfish). The comedy lies in the disconnect between the two entities: character goals and player goals.<br/><br/>InSpectres is funny because of the Confessional and because of the mundane aspects of the otherwise ridiculous situation. When the GM lets you blow off a zombie's head without much opposition but you need to roll Stress because you slip in the resulting spatter of blood, that's funny... especially when the game rewards you for falling down.<br/><br/>And Grey Ranks is funny because children fighting wars is hilarious. Ok, I'm not serious.<br/><br/>BTW, "playing straight" means that you need something non-comedic to put up against the comedic aspects of the game. You need an Abbot to go with your Costello or a Venkman to go against your Stanz. Otherwise it's "zany whacky!" and that's just plain ol' comedic hack-ness.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226753/#Comment_226753" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T10:57:12+00:00" title="August 22, 2009 10:57AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2009 11:03AM by Jack Aidley.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>Jack, what do you mean when you say "empower the players to be funny"?</blockquote>\nEncourage it, expect it of them, and set things up so they're free to be funny without having to fuss too much about their ability to perform the actions they think is funny.

You should look into some biographies of great comedians, or books about great comedies, or great comedies themselves. Really look into them. I post here on story-games for a lot of reasons but number one is I like stories in my games.  And the number one way I improve the stories in my games is that I read a shitload of stories, and a shitload of books about stories.  And if a story in my game is stumbling along it is often not related to the game at all - it is more related to my understanding of good and bad stories. So please, please, do yourself a giant favor. Go and start watching great movie comedies at the very least. There is no reason not to start, so many wonderful comedies are in the public domain. Watch them once for enjoyment and watch them again for analysis.  And if you don't enjoy them, don't inflict a comedic game upon yourself. There are people that don't like jokes or comedy, it's not that they don't have a sense of humor, it's just that they don't go there for enjoyment of life and would rather go elsewhere.<br/><br/>Here, I will give you some places to start, Hulu links first, then Internet Archive:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.hulu.com/africa-screams" rel="nofollow">Africa Screams</a> - Abbott and Costello<br/><a href="http://www.hulu.com/the-noose-hangs-high" rel="nofollow">The Noose Hangs High</a> - same team<br/><br/>Question for review:<br/><br/>Why is Bud Abbott there if we have a whole cast of "straight" characters?

At first I didn't understand you at all. And thanks for all the movie examples.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't enjoy comic movies nor ditto books. I really don't. But I really enjoy joking with my friends. We are writing a game which is supposed to facilitate fun collaborative talk with your friends. I agree, although I never thought about it earlier, that it would make sense to to some degree vwelve into comic posturing and so on. You have a good point, I have to admit. I will watch some of the stuff you mention, at least. But what feels more releant for me would to be to play and read other comic games.<br/><br/>(But now I remember that I actually like Charlie Chaplin. Like, really like. When I watched his movies a few years ago I just assumed that they would bore me to death. That kind of mindset usually leads makes it impossible to enjoy the films, but I the movies really took my by surprise.)<br/><br/>Second: The comic aspect of the game is not necessarily the most important part. It is clearly written to create comedy and that is essential, but the setting of the game is also really important. I will take this opportunity to say something about what it is about, even if this might not be the best place to do so. It is cetainly not a genereic 'comedy game', it is written for a very specific type of comedy.<br/><br/>The game is named after a Swedish scandal man and obscure celebrity, Johnny Bode. This Bode was a successful song writer in Stockholm during the twenties and thirties. Later he worked as a musical writer in Vienna and Brussels. Today he is by far most known for his pornographic songs from the sixites. He was also a thief, a complusory liar and had many sad, but darkly funny things happening to him, like: Fleeing from Sweden to Norway (during the nazi occupation of the latter) to work as writer of nazi musicals, being forcefully put into mental care on return and later steralized (neutered) by the Swedish state. He also wrote pornographic novels and famously stole kitchen silver (probably not the correct translation) from Sweden's most famous movie actor at the time.<br/><br/>The game itself is about high society drunkards or low society drunkards, who for some reason are allowed to hang with the famous. It takes place in Stockholm in what we like to call the Mythic Thirties. Each game is about a group of these people meeting up and trying to remember what took place during one all-but-forgotten night. (And just to make everyone more comfortable: Is totally lacks nazi-humour. That is just an unfortunate detail in his backstory. Prostitutes and lewd talk might occur, on the other hand.)<br/><br/>During the game every player is GM for exactly one chapter each. The rules are written to give the players (not the GM) the possibility to quickly change important facts in the game. Our intention with the resolution system is to make big success and big failure equally desirable to the player. (And much more... but that's not for today.)<br/><br/>So while I haven't watched comedies I have listened a lot to Bode's pornographic songs, read his  pornographic novels and also been watching Swedish movies from the thirties. The relevant genre is something called "Pilsnerfilm", ("beer movies"!) lighthearted and low budget movies with songs and complicated love intrigues. Since this genre of movies basically is what people in my generation tend to know about this era we try to pick quite a bit from them, content as well as dramatic ideas.<br/><br/>Also, we will almost certainly not translate this game to English, since it would be hopeless considering the subject. However, if the new rules work better in actual play (I hope!) than the old ones (the first playtest took place back in 2003, so it's time to finalize...) did I might try to use parts of the rule core for an English language game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226889/#Comment_226889" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T06:40:54+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  6:40AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2009 10:26AM by sven.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks, thanks for all the answers.

In my specific case I attempt to be funny in the examples of play, anything else would be a bit bizarre. But for the text itself I just try to be a little bit more lighthearted than usually, but I am always when writing mainly obsessed with trying to get the rules through very clearly. I consiously often repeat myself and write everything in a very procedural way, which probable can be seen as boring by those non-engineer people I have read about. (I never see them, except my wife, but she doesn't read anything I write anyway.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227958/#Comment_227958" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T13:24:51+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  1:24PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sven</cite>Failure is funny.
