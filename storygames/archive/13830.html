I'm sure there are other people around here like that, because we've seen some great discussions about writing in compendiums (compendia?).<br/><br/>I was recently unpacking some boxes after moving house late last year and I found some of my old notebooks. They had pages and pages of absolute crap...but stuff that I thought was really good at the time. But in each of the notebooks, there were a coupe of fragments that I looked at and thought "Why haven't I used this yet??? THIS IS AWESOME!!"...quickly followed by "This is still incomplete and I haven't come up with a game idea that can use it".<br/><br/>Examples: <br/>* A simple trait based live-roleplaying system (I haven't run a good live game in years, and that's why this hasn't seen the light of day).<br/>* A simple step-die system for miniatures which I wrote up in the early 90s (most people I've payed miniatures with have only wanted to play with established rules sets, so this has basically been neglected and forgotten).<br/>* A few twisted forms of magic that could be applied to a setting (I just haven't found the right setting or genre for these rules to emulate).<br/>* etc...<br/><br/>So I'm basically wondering who else has had these moments.<br/><br/>What have you found among your old ideas that would be awesome to use, but you just haven't had the opportunity to use them?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313133/#Comment_313133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T21:53:03+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  9:53PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are basically describing my life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313144/#Comment_313144" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T00:43:02+00:00" title="February 18, 2011 12:43AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few months after I published Agon, I found an old notebook that had basically the whole game system in it.
