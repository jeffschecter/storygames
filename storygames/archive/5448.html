The first time I came across it was in Beast Hunters (which I haven't played). I want you to help me understand it.<br/><br/>Here's what it looks like:<br/><br/>In a competitive situation, one player does something. His opponent then rates how well he did, or offers him points for what he did. The number of points or rating determines how well the player does against the opponent.<br/><br/>It sounds kind of fiat-y and subjective and weird. Subjective assessment and fiercely competitive are not two things you often see together--at least not by the person who is supposed to be the adversary!<br/><br/>So... how does it work? <br/><br/>And, the follow-up question: what makes it fun?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Novembre" title="Novembre"><img alt="Novembre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Novembre">Novembre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122122/#Comment_122122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T22:28:51+00:00" title="January 26, 2008 10:28PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not played Beast Hunters yet, but I've read it. In BH, the player can refuse the offer and resort to dice. The point is that upon an offer, the player has to choose between a sure gain (the offer) or a dice roll that can go everywhere from zero to victory (so to say). Who makes the offer, on the other hand, needs to assess the probabilities of the other player to make it on his own (i.e., with dice), and offer an amount big enough to be enticing for the other but not too detrimental for himself.<br/><br/>Without playing it, only reading, BH didn't seem to me flat, but the right blend of competition and collaboration: more competitive than collaborative, but not to the point "I'll screw you, should the game go to hell".<br/><br/>I'm sure I've played more than a boardgame with a similar mechanics, in which one offers to the other something, and the other can accept or face his fate ("say yes or roll the dice", only with a different meaning).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122137/#Comment_122137" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T00:45:47+00:00" title="January 27, 2008 12:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In "Charles the Bald is Superf***ed", there's a similar mechanic. It's a multi-player game where players rate each others' narration by giving each other tokens. However, they have a fixed budget they must use each turn - so if we're four players, each of us has to distribute five tokens to the other players every turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122193/#Comment_122193" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T11:53:31+00:00" title="January 27, 2008 11:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2008 11:56AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip's right on all counts. It's NOT a competitive game. The GM is supposed to challenge and push the players, not to work against them.<br/><br/>Ron described it as "weightlifting for Gamists," and that's pretty astute. The GM is the spotter who also pushes the other person to reach for their limits to get the most out of the session. And then you trade off and do the same for her in return.<br/><br/>And the ability to resort to dice is crucial, yes. See, there's a two-way aligning going on here. The player figures out how to impress the GM and gauges success by the AP offers. The GM figures out how to best reward the player by seeing how often or on which particular offers the player goes for dice. Over a short amount of play time, they thusly learn things about each other and over time work together more smoothly.<br/><br/>It's more taxing on the GM if the GM has very definite expectations. My hope is that it teaches GMs to let go of a lot of those over time, and how much fun it is to let the players take the reigns and let them shine. (It gets a lot more taxing with more than one Hunter, by the way, which is one reason it's at its core focused on two-player games.)<br/><br/>ETA: Does this answer your question on how that's fun, or would you like to know how I enjoy playing that way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122200/#Comment_122200" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T13:55:27+00:00" title="January 27, 2008  1:55PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Beast Hunters, the GM is giving points for how cool the player's narration is. So if you, as the player, pull out some weak sauce, "uhm... I attack. I hit it with my sword," the GM gives out only a few points. I've only played once, but it seems like going to the dice is pretty risky. What the GM is doing is encouraging you to produce cool narration, and then rewarding you for that. The more entertaining you are, the faster you win, basically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122208/#Comment_122208" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T14:37:03+00:00" title="January 27, 2008  2:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, that makes sense.<br/><br/>So, in Beast Hunters, the GM makes an offer based on how cool the player's narration is, right?<br/><br/>Are there other games that use this sort of mechanic? Callan S. posted some rules he calls "Dance of Death" on the Forge, which have a similar element. <br/><br/>Any more comments on why this is fun?
