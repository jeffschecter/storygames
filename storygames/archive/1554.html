                    This is compiling the results of the thread, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1283&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>"You Know What They Say: Once you go Indie..."</b></a>.  In that thread, Joshua BishopRoby asked about purchasing behavior "<i>since you bought and played your first indie game.</i>"  In some cases the answer is wasn't clear -- in part because the question is unclear.  In case of qualifications, I've gone with change in purchasing behavior shortly prior to playing the first Forge-associated games.  For stats, I haven't distinguished between degrees of change -- i.e. a little bit less, a lot less, or none.  So here are the questions and my count of responses: 
<blockquote><i>1) ...have you continued to buy the same amount of mainstream game books? More mainstream game books? Fewer mainstream game books?</i></blockquote>

So at least for this crowd, indie gaming is dominant but it isn't cheaper.  <br/><br/>Still, the minority positions are evident in all cases.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure if there are any greater conclusions to draw.                </div>

                            One self-evident conclusion is the supportive/incestuous (your choice) nature of this community, as exemplified by Thursday at Gen Con, when we all bought great stacks of each other's games the minute the booth opened for business.                        </div>

                            I like to think of the community as "supportive" rather than "incestuous". We support each other in our endeavours, that includes buying games. I do this not because I feeling I must, but because a game interests and attracts me, so I purchase it with the full intention of running/playing it and giving feedback. <br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>

<p>As a matter of principle, I only buy the things I'm interested in. Often, not even that. So when I buy a game, it's not just because I know the guy; it's because they've made something good.</p>

                            I frequently buy indie games that I might never play, both to support the particular authors as well as to get something else out of it, namely fresh ideas for game design.  In the past few months, though, all our resources (and savings) have been going into our own design.                        </div>

                            I only buy games that I want to play, but I buy them knowing full well that I probably won't ever get to. I have far too many and game far too little. I also like to read mechanics and steal concepts for my own designs.                        </div>

                            I don't think it's bad if I buy a game because I like the person who made it or just want to support them. It's obviously much cooler for the person if I buy their game because I love the game itself. But I think of it as a future investment. It's like buying a just ok album from a band I love. I buy to support them so there is a future album which could possibly rock!<br/><br/>My reasons for buying games are usually in the following order:<br/>- Someone I like made it (sometimes I buy 2, 1 for me and 1 for my fiancÃ©)<br/>- I know I will play it<br/>- The system is innovative<br/>- The system relates to something I am developing myself<br/>- I like the layout and way information is communicated<br/>- I like the setting/art                        </div>

                            For reference, the thing that interested me about the results was the conversion factor.  Now, it's possible that story-games is just a self-selected land of converts.

I'm curious who you're considering "converted" here.  <br/><br/>Notably, this survey didn't directly address the buying of indie games.  You can only infer from the answers whether someone is a steady consumer of indie RPG books.  <br/><br/>For example, I voted same purchase of mainstream games -- and more (in number and money) purchases overall.  I'd consider myself "converted" in that I'm now a steady consumer of indie RPG books.  However, I'm not converted in the sense of dropping other styles of gaming.                        </div>

                            John, there were a number of people who answered in the Fewer Mainstream Games / More Games / More Money vein.  There was a significant minority that answered No Mainstream Games / More Games.  I wouldn't dream of actually labelling the purchase and play of indie games the one and only cause in all of these cases, but the trend does seem to suggest that purchasing decisions were altered after exposure to indie games.<br/><br/>You, to be perfectly fair, were not in the majority in that you purchase the same amount of Mainstream games (and I can totally respect that).  Lots of others, though, do appear to have dropped other styles of gaming.  The roughest trend here is that players buy fewer mainstream games but more games overall (and therefore more indie games) after exposure to indie games.<br/><br/>Now, it's totally a straw poll, and I'll be the first to acknowledge that.  It's why I'd like to see more numbers from other places.  However, to 'do it up right' with some very solid results would take a whole lot of effort and probably wouldn't be worth it.  So I'm very careful not to make any conclusions, or make any statements where my only support is this poll.  I do, though, think that this poll is at the very least suggestive.                        </div>

Sure, I'm not arguing that.  I agree completely. But what I wanted to know is what you consider "converted".  <br/><br/>I guess I should say why I care.  I feel that the important thing for selling indie RPGs is whether you get customers, not whether those customers drop mainstream games.  Whereas "conversion" implies that you're trying to get them to replace their other gaming with indie games.  While that undoubtably has happened to a bunch of people, I feel the important thing is getting people to buy and play indie games regardless of whether they continue to play other games.  <br/><br/>On a practical level, I think that good questions for a further survey would be something like: Do you buy indie games?  Do you play indie games?  Have your purchases increased, decreased, or stayed the same?                        </div>

                            Yay, Tad! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The important thing for me, John, is making good games for people to play.  However, once you factor in the mammoth international nightmare that is the distribution of these games across the entire "industry," there are a lot of questions that crop up, and practicalities begin rearing heads.  So that's one take.<br/><br/>I'm also just simply interested in the trends of my own hobby.  Indie gaming as we know it today wasn't even <em>possible</em> ten years ago.  Now it is, and I'm glad for the change, but I wonder what more changes might be coming.  I know folks on both the indie and mainstream side of the fence, and I wonder about how they relate to each other and what market forces will do to their enjoyment of the hobby.  I am curious what roleplaying will look like when my hypothetical kids are in their twenties.  And so on.<br/><br/>So I don't mean "conversion" in, say, religious terms.  I mean "conversion" more in demographic terms: is the roleplaying market turning incrementally indie?  Or are indie games just a blip?  What does that mean for the kinds of games that will be available to me in years to come?  What will I need to do to create and sell my own games?  And so on.                        </div>

                            As best I can tell, it is supportive rather than incestuous by and large.  People don't seem to buy stuff they think isn't cool, if they did that would be incestuous.<br/><br/>It would actually be weird if people didn't buy each other's stuff, given that they will most likely have seen all the work going into the new game and had plenty of time to get jazzed up about it.  Ideas that nobody likes tend not to get developed anyway, if something gets enough support to get finished I would expect it to get bought by those supporters as a rule.<br/><br/>As for conversion, I think that a sizeable minority of the hobby has been poorly served for years, making do with games that were not really designed for their tastes.  Some people in the hobby want games that help create stories, and trad rpgs are the best tools they find for that task, but trad rpgs aren't really designed for that so it's not that great an experience always for those guys.<br/><br/>If they are lucky enough to encounter the indie stuff, I would expect people in that demographic to embrace it and not look back.<br/><br/>Plus there will always be those like me who like both, who play a whack of trad but occasionally crack open the indie.<br/><br/>I doubt there are that many going the other way, starting indie but eventually jacking it in for the joys of trad gaming.  Mostly I doubt that as people are far more likely currently to initially encounter trad gaming.  If indie ever gets really big though I would eventually expect there to be some frustrated indie gamers who would then go around looking for a more task orientated and thematically agnostic experience.  <br/><br/>So I think there is a degree of conversion, I think that's natural and I think it's a good thing.  Conversion is people who were making do with games that didn't quite do what they were looking for instead finding games that do exactly what they're looking for.  That's a good thing.                        </div>

Well, I don't think that incestuous and supportive are contradictory terms.  Incestuous implies that there is a narrow, relatively closed community.  An incestuous community can be extremely supportive of its members, but it isn't very open to outsiders.  I don't think the indie community is very incestuous, but I think it is something to watch out for.  <br/><br/>For example, while many indie people have in principle called for marketing to non-role-players, GenCon is by far the biggest marketing event, and most of the other channels also seem to be aimed at traditional role-players.

And there are plenty of indie games for them to go to for that, like Perfect20, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coyote Trail</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Harm's Way</span>, and others.  "Indie" does not mean "conflict oriented" and "thematic".   <br/><br/>I think that by its nature, indie games are always going to be experimental -- but the broadly successful experiments will be adopted (and possibly mangled) by game companies.  We have already seen a lot of story mechanics in non-indie games -- by Robin Laws, Allen Varney, Rebecca Borgstrom, Greg Stafford, and others.                        </div>
