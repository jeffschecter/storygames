                    I keep thinking about setting in game books, what it is, and what I like seeing.  I see a lot of people saying "hey, I want this, or that", and most of them have really colorful analogies.  So here's mine.<br/>
<br/>
I want a playground.<br/>
<br/>
I want everything I see in the playground to make me go "hey, we could play on that - we could do this, or that, or something else".   And if it's all matching colors and styles, that's cool; a big chunky blue plastic playground says "hey, space games".  It can be detailed - if you want to let me know that the merry-go-round is *not* recommended for games of tag, that's cool; I might do it anyway, but that's my lookout. <br/>
<br/>
But I don't want to ever see a big statue in the middle of the playground a sign that says "do not touch", with the teacher standing over it making sure I don't find something else to do with it.  If it's in the playground, it better be fair game for *something*.<br/>
<br/>
And if somebody has a list of cool games we can play on the playground, that's cool.  Now I know we can play tag, and hide-and-seek, and sardines, on this playground.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure I'm going anywhere with this.  Just kind of blathering.                </div>

And if I want to climb up the slide, rather than go up the ladder and slide down on my butt with feet forward for safety, that should be cool.                        </div>

                            Okay, first principle:<br/>
<br/>
If there's anything in your setting that is intended as an "absolute force", I'm not going to find it interesting above and beyond the fact that it does X, and let's not think about that anymore.  I don't go to the playground to look at the ground and remark on how cool it is; no more will I be impressed by the "hard barriers" of your setting, though I'd like to be aware of them.  That means if I'm gonna meet the undefeatable NPC or super-dude, I don't want to hear more about him than the raw basics.  Bob can't be beaten, he's like a raw force of nature, and he wants X.  X is what interests me, not Bob; he may be a great MacGuffin for bvringing in plot, but I'm not interested in him past that.<br/>
<br/>
Second Principle:<br/>
<br/>
Anything in your setting that you don't expect me to play with - stuff that's just color - should be instead folded around something I can play with.  Don't string Christmas lights over my playground and expect me to do anything other than try and play with them; I'll tie my shoes together and throw 'em up there if I have to.  <br/>
<br/>
Third Principle:<br/>
<br/>
Anything that's in the playground is there to play with *how* the kids want to.  Yeah, if we fall off the top of the slides / piss off your mega-corporation / whatever, we're gonna bust something, and that's fine.  But don't be telling me that it's impossible to fall off the slides; just tell me how bad it hurts when I do, maybe warn me about it once.                        </div>

                            I really like this. It links into the Licensed Settings thread as well. <br/>
<br/>
What I want, when I'm using an established setting (such as a TV series setting) is to treat it as a playground. Not to be told "you can't do this" but to be able to mess about with what's there.<br/>
<br/>
So, if I'm doing a Dr Who game, I want to be able to have the Master regenerate as a woman and have the chameleon circuits on the TARDIS fixed. Not to be told "Oh, you can't have a Time Lord in there because they all died in the Time War and, anyway, they wouldn't meddle with time like that."<br/>

Hmm.  A playground seems kind of static to me.  All the equipment is already there.  The only thing you can do is swing from it, climb on it, sit on it, whatelse?  To me, a setting should be an acting stage with a huge prop room in the back and a whole lotta power tools.  All the equipment is still there, but it's up to you to build the set(ting) for your particular game.  Much more dynamic, IMO.<br/>

                            Hm.<br/>
<br/>
Here's why I like licensed settings:<br/>
<br/>
"A standard shuttle lands in the docking bay.  A woman comes down the landing ramp.  She's dressed as a Jedi, and has two lightsabers hanging from her belt.  Incongruously, she has a warm, friendly smile on her cute, button-nosed face."<br/>
<br/>
Contrast with:<br/>
<br/>
"A small shuttle lands in the docking bay.  It's about the size of a school bus, has two stubby wings that fold up as it lands, and a large tailfin on top.  It appears to be unarmed.  A woman comes down the landing ramp. She's wearing a brown robe over a beige tunic, in the style of the warrior-priests.  On her belt, she carries two of their traditional melee weapons, laser swords which the warrior-priests are known for using with deadly skill.  In contrast to the warrior-priests reputation for aloof seriousness, she has a warm, friendly smile on her cute, button-nosed face."<br/>
<br/>
Licensed settings give me shorthand that I can use to put the focus where I want it more efficiently.  The players aren't going, "Wait, how do the warrior priests use their laser swords?  Are they like the flashlight lasers in Ringworld?"                        </div>

Take Forgotten Realms for instance.  In my point of view, it's got a huge playground.  There are slides and ladders and all kinds of places for a character to go.  But what can you actually do with it except explore what's there?  It's been so detailed over the years that there's really nothing major left the characters to accomplish as far as the *Setting* goes.  To me, FR would be a whole lot better without Elminster, Driz, Blackstaff, Maztica, Thay, etc. etc. etc.<br/>

Yes and no.<br/>

Yes, it's big, and there's lots to play with.  But there's also this huge sum of stuff that we're *not* really allowed to play with, if it's run by the book.  To me, that stuff needs to be ripped out - there's all these big statues in the playground that I'm not supposed to touch, and they're in my damn way.<br/>

So, uh, I agree, sort of?                        </div>

                            To me, Elminster and company serve a purpose though. They're models of what you, too, can be. Only the rules really don't make it very easy to become that. The setting isn't broken; the rules are -- or, rather, the setting and rules have a disconnect. Elminster is a promise and a dream that almost never comes true.                        </div>

                            The following came up in my podcast, so I apologize if anyone has heard it before.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine was running a Forgotten Realms campaign and asked me what he should do.<br/>
<br/>
I said that he should open the game with Elminster being found crucified in a prominent square of Waterdeep.  And that's what he did.<br/>
<br/>
"This ain't the Forgotten Realms in your book, this is ours now."<br/>
<br/>
I dig that, taking a setting and making it ours.  With FR, I felt that the point needed to be made brutally.<br/>
<br/>
The group took Elminster down from his crucifiction and set out to find his murderers.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
What JD and Judd suggest doing with FR is about the only think left to do with it.  Deconstruct it, break it down, use irony.  It's reached its limit of what can be added, so the only thing left is to take away.  It's kinda like what Cervantes did with Don Quixote.  He didn't feel compelled to write an epic in the Homer/Virgil tradition, so he turned it on its head.  What's worse, in FR's case, the designers themselves can't do that, they've got too much invested.  World of Darkness used to be the same way until WW blew it up and restarted it.  I'll at least give them credit for that.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            I disagree, I think there's plenty of things to do in Forgotten Realms that don't require deconstruction. If you look at my adventure hook thread, you'll find all kinds of ideas that nonetheless are right there in the text waiting to be played. <br/>
<br/>
What it does require is an approach that recognizes the source material is basically juvenile fantasy, to be enjoyed with a grin and a laugh even during its most seemingly oppressive and grim moments.  Imagine it as a theater you know well, with 100 different backdrops and 100 different costumes - sure, eventually you'll see them all, but eventually you get familiar enough with them that you can improv a whole show just by yanking ropes at random and sending the hot chicks back into wardrobe to get into a different outfit.  The audience has probably seen it all too, but if you're good with formula, you'll keep them coming back.<br/>
<br/>
It is very possible to work too hard at Forgotten Realms games. There's always going to be something more you can read. (Good call at connecting this feeling to oWoD.) The question in all such highly developed settings is, or ought to be, "what piece do I grab?", not "how can I fit all this on stage at once??"                        </div>

                            I have no real problem with the Forgotten Realms and the 3.0 hardback they put out is a beautiful freakin' book, even if I never used it (thought to be fair, the year or so I played 3.0, I was neck deep in my own homebrew setting) and I agree there is stuff to be done with FG.<br/>
<br/>
My only problem with FG, particularly when playing with a new group I don't know so well, is getting mired in the novels and other assorted baggage that come with a setting with that kind of history.  Whackin' Elminster early was my way of saying, "This is no longer the Forgotten Realms in the Icewind Dale novels.  This is OURS and we are going to muck it right up in the course of our world-busting adventures."<br/>
<br/>
I have long wanted to run a gritty Waterdeep campaign about the bodyguards of the masked councillors who rule that Waterdeep with TRoS...not sure why.                        </div>

-To me, JD, laughing at or treating a game written seriously as juevenile is irony.  Improv usage of the setting, in my mind, is deconstruction.  Perhaps I'm using the terms too broadly, but it seems to me at this point the best one can hope for in FR is pastiche, deconstruction, or irony.  Not very attractive, IMO.  They've just gone too far in developing it.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            I see the seriousness of the source material as part of the fun of the experience caused by it. Batman is serious. Batman comics are fun. The Zhentarim are serious. A game where you beat up the Zhentarim with your magic sword and smooth-dressing companions is fun. Surely this is not deconstruction.                        </div>

                            I want to tinker.  Well, more, I want the ability to tinker just as much as I want and not sweat the small stuff that gets in the way.  To that extent, I often have troubles designing because I end up "tinker"ing too much with the product and losing the focus.  What was a "roll d6" becomes "roll d6 unless it's your Primary Trait, at which point roll d8+d4 and divide by 2" or whatnot.  This always stymied me, and I generally pinned it down to the question of, "Am I writing this as a hobby, or as a potential business?"  If it's a hobby, I can play.  If it's a business, I need to get to work.                        </div>

Funny, looking through old threads and ran across the above quote.

                            Being both a Burning Wheel and a Forgotten Realms fan, I've been working on something that combined the two for a while. The main big decision I'm working on is that BW heroes are pretty serious, and often quite experienced, whereas starting Realms heroes are often kinda scrubs, and the wide variety of adventure available for scrubs and uberpowered mega-gods in the Realms is one of the things I like about it. If anyone has a ton of experience working up lifepaths for BW situations, I'm really interested to hear any tips.                        </div>

                            I haven't had any problems with the BW LP's as written for what I picture in the Forgotten Realms.<br/><br/>The two players in this game went with higher powered characters, rather than struggling adventurers just getting their start, this probably has something to do with the game's premise, protecting masked lords.  The characters are a 5 lifepath elf and dwarf, both harpers, both bad-asses.  One is the leader of the elven community in Waterdeep and the other is a deposed dwarven prince whose keep was taken by dwarves and now he leads an adventuring group.<br/><br/>If we had decided to go the scrub route, I think we just would have gone with 3 (really rough!) or 4 (more balanced first level vibe) lifepath characters.                        </div>

                            What I started to do was to make lifepathing ridiculously simplistic, and try to do more with the other aspects of chargen. So yeah, it was about 3 steps, with:<br/><br/>A "Born To..." step, which was primarily about social class, with a few weird outliers. <br/>A childhood step, which corresponded to a D&amp;D attribute: A Strong Childhood, A Dextrous Childhood, A Charismatic Childhood, etc. <br/>And then an "early training" step which corresponded to a D&amp;D class: "Magical Training" was my generic wizard one, for example.<br/><br/>Now yeah, as you note, with only 3 entries, you're going to have reeeeal fragile characters, even moreso than I wanted, so I was making each step a bit more powerful than the ones in the main BW book. So these three lifepath steps would approximate 4 or so in the normal BW system. <br/><br/>It is a fun project, although by the time I got to that point I was questioning whether it would be better just to work up a bolt-on for D&amp;D3 and have done with it...<br/><br/>I should come back to it sometime, thanks for the tips.                        </div>

                            Hey Jason,<br/><br/>Three lifepath characters are my favorite starting BW characters. We play them frequently! <br/><br/>Here are a few ideas for human characters. I'm sure there are many other combinations, but these leapt out at me!<br/><br/>Fighter:<br/>Born Noble, Page, Squire<br/>Born Peasant, Hunter, Foot Soldier<br/>Born City, Groom, City Guard<br/>Village Born, Kid, Village Guard<br/>Born Peasant, Runner (Soldier), Freebooter<br/><br/>Paladin:<br/>Born Noble, Page, Religious Acolyte<br/>Village Born, Temple Acolyte, Bannerman<br/><br/>Ranger:<br/>Born Noble, Strider, Archer/Scout<br/>Born Noble, Strider, Hunter<br/>Born Peasant, Hunter, Scout<br/>Born Peasant, Hunter, Strider<br/><br/>Cleric:<br/>Born Peasant, Temple Acolyte, Itinerant Monk<br/>Born Noble, Religious Acolyte, Foot Soldier<br/>Village Born, Acolyte, Village Priest<br/><br/>Wizard:<br/>Born Noble, Arcane Devotee, Sorcerer<br/>Born City, Neophyte Sorcerer, Sorcerer<br/><br/>Thief:<br/>Born Village, Kid, Pickpocket<br/>Born City, Pickpocket, Criminal<br/>Born City, Apprentice, Locksmith <br/><br/>These characters are fun to play and advance quickly. Our Burning THAC0 campaign started with such three lifepath characters back in 2006. They have now organically advanced to the point that they're fighting dragons, greater demons and armies of orcs. <br/><br/>To give you an idea, take a look at <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?6158-Two-Faces-of-Petronax" rel="nofollow">The Two Faces of Petronax</a>. Petronax is my wizard in the Burning THAC0 game. In this thread I posted what he looked like as a raw starting character (Petronax the Hawk) and then what he looked like after 18 months of regular play (Petronax the Many Hued). Today's version (Petronax the Demigod) has B8 stats across the board (except Agility, which is still B6), a G8 Sorcery, G6 Herbalism, and is well on his way to graying out his Will (and not too far from whiting out his Sorcery).<br/><br/>Our game is set in Mystara and we have made it our playground. My character's nemesis is Bargle (he has the Nemesis trait; whenever one of us shakes a fist at the skies and snarls, "Bargle!" as the result of one of his schemes, he earns a Persona point). We have tangled with the Black Eagle Baron, earned accolades from the Grand Duke of Karameikos, savaged the Veiled Society, explored the Isle of Dread and the Lost Vale of Hutaka, gotten lost in the deserts of Yalarum, placed our dwarf on the throne of Rockhome, and are currently politicking in Alfheim.<br/><br/>If you're interested in doing something like this, I highly recommend downloading Ara Kooser's <a href="http://burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#Burning_THAC0" rel="nofollow">Burning THAC0</a>, a compilation of advice for bringing that feel to a BW game.                        </div>

                            Two thoughts occur to me:<br/><br/>1) Fiasco hits the "setting as playground" nail right on the <a href="/forums/profile/%25%23%26amp">@%#&amp;</a>;ing head.  One of your friends says "hey, we should go play on this cool slide/jungle gym/bank waiting to be robbed/whatever" and another friend says "yeah, that would be awesome" and everyone plays on the thing for a while.<br/><br/>2) The designer of Katamari Damacy (you know, that weird videogame about rolling stuff up in balls) was a professional playground designer.  Which is part of why it was so successful.  In many ways, game design and playground design are very similar: you're trying to make an environment for other people to have fun in.                        </div>

                            To Levi... do any of the following games offer settings that fit your definition of playground? If so, what do they do to make it so? If not, where do they fail?

                            As a sorta follow up to Wordman's post, what games have made the setting a playground organizationally?<br/><br/>In a way, liscensed settings actually strike me as doing this better. After all, presumably if you want to play around in a setting, you already kknow the setting from the source material and are more set to play with it from step one.<br/><br/>And here I'm just thinking about really simple stuff like one or two page setting stuff. Kinda like the really brief intro that Lady Blackbird has for the setting, complete with artwork. <br/><br/>It just strikes me that this is one of those undeveloped/underconsidered aspects in a lot of games. Where are the really brief player handout synopses of the setting and possibilities there and playstyles appropriate to it?<br/><br/>For printed items, they're stuck in a book, probably owned by the initiating player, along with all kinds of mechanical stuff and secrets, which creates issues of access, but also issues for "we don't care about mechanics" players and "we don't care about the involved details of the setting " players facing walls of text<br/><br/>(But then, I have been on a Simple/Easy/Anybody can do this Stuff kick recently, so maybe I'm missing Levi's core points)                        </div>

                            Okay, deviating slightly from the OP here, but still in the vein of 'the setting as something that is an active part of the fun' I have a few thoughts. First off, Apocalypse World gives you some very rough guidelines, and then actively encourages you to not only make up parts of the setting in play, but then to ruthlessly change/discover/tear down these elements as you go, and while there's a heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationships, in a lot of instances, elements of the setting become like characters of their own.<br/><br/>Archipelago also very consciously sets out to establish some facts about the setting that you play with, and it does it in such a simple, fluid way that I'm really impressed. I'm still trying to internalize its wise lessons (thanks, Matthjis!)<br/><br/>Shock: Social Science fiction likewise has the potential for the setting to take center stage with what you're doing, considering the 'tagonists are basically vehicles for exploring this funky social situation you've set up.<br/><br/>Finally, if I may, my own game in development <a href="http://dicegods.wordpress.com/games/celto-germania/" rel="nofollow">The Book of Threes</a> features an active setting/situation creation element, and my first playtest attempt (which petered out in an informative way) gave me some insights into what you do and don't want there. I found out that a) requiring too much 'setting creation' before actual play doesn't do it for everybody, and b) when players are creating a setting, while they like collaboration, they also like to have some 'ownership' of certain elements (which I should have learned from Archipelago!).<br/><br/>So, if you are going to go for tinkering with your own stuff to play with a setting, I'd recommend fast, fluid initial prompts, clear ownership of certain elements, and then ongoing detail building through play. That way you for sure don't have any big 'canon' getting in your way, but you still have clear artistic vision to keep things consistent. That's the tack I'll be taking with my game, anyway.                        </div>
