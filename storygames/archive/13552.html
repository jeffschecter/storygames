Each entrant is randomly assigned a set of other games to give feedback to. You secretly rank each game you're assigned for "design quality" (for whatever that means to you), and the various rankings are synthesized by the organizer to determine the design winner for the round. Each person receiving feedback ranks the people who were assigned to give them feedback based on how helpful the person was (for whatever that means to them, so there's an element of playing to the person in that you need to figure out whether the person needs cheerleading, challenging questions, advice, something else, etc.). These rankings are also synthesized to determine the feedback winner for the round. The next round is similar, but you have a different random mix of games to give feedback to / people to get feedback from. There are points awarded for placing at various levels for the various rounds which are totaled to determine the overall winner. (You could easily add other stuff to this system, too, like a playtesting component, or special judge's prizes awarded by individuals outside of the ranking system). You'd probably have to figure out how to account for some people flaking out in the middle of the process and not delivering their drafts, feedbacks, or rankings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306241/#Comment_306241" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T10:44:26+00:00" title="December 29, 2010 10:44AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forum ate my post.  <br/><br/>The participants are judged chiefly on their feedback and contributions.  It's not about your personal design work, but rather your ability to critique and help others in the community.  The contest will persist over a span of 4 weeks, with each week associated with a stage of design.   Work on your game via a forum and solicit feedback.  At the end of each weekend, a poll goes up and asks which other participant provided the most meaningful and useful feedback for your game.    Compare all 4 weeks of the polls to determine the winner.  <br/><br/>Week 1: Initial concept in line with the game-chef ingredients.<br/>Week 2: First draft focusing on mechanics (does the crunch work?)<br/>Week 3: Second draft focusing on story (does it encourage compelling stories?)<br/>Week 4: Wordsmithing (Does it teach the game and communicate it to an audience appropriately?)<br/><br/>For bonus points, with a standardized format it might be possible to have all submissions donated to the community.  Put together an anthology of these 5-10 page games and publish them in zero-risk pdf and Lulu combo.

But what if you switch it up between weeks, so in Week 2 you're doing a first draft to someone else's Week 1 concept document of your choice.

I feel like I would fall into the trap of just editing and refining it and not really creating something that was mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Or, if I could work with the original writer for that week and get feedback and what-not, then there is the potential there for some awesome collaboration.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But, to get a supposedly finished copy and not be able to rely on the author's input for clarification, etc. It just seems too restrictive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Or, maybe I am not looking at it from the right angle... I don't know...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306414/#Comment_306414" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T15:06:05+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  3:06PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Paul, Mendel,<br/>Anyways, I too like Jason's format, if we can add a step for playtesting, it is golden!<br/>Dave  M</blockquote>\nIn my view, play-testing is integral in the feedback process.  Week 2, 3 and 4 each require different kinds of playtesting and those would provide excellent feedback.  <br/><br/>One idea which might work particularly well is to allow forking projects.  After each week, people can abandon their current designs and build derivative works based on someone elses design thus far.  They would diverge and with the tight feedback between the two parallel designers they might be able to produce stronger games.  <br/><br/>What are people's thoughts with regards to my lulu/pdf granting anthology idea?   If we set up sensible restrictions on length/format, I am crazy enough to volunteer to do layout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307191/#Comment_307191" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T19:38:04+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  7:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would very much like to see this fledgeling contest idea take root and grow.
