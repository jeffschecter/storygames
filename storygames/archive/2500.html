What I find fascinating about them is, in large part, what I find fascinating about places like Story Games, and BLogs and stuff like that.<br/><br/>PBP games are <i>inherently</i> self-documenting (everything that happens is documented) and open.  They already have, built in, the tools for community formation <b>beyond the players</b>.<br/><br/>They just usually do a crap job of harnessing all that.<br/><br/>I'm envisioning a PBP game where there is a deliberate effort to provide a stimulating core around which a community of spectators and "not-quite-participants" can form.  Quite simply, I think that PBP would make a good spectator-sport for the internet.  I've got some thoughts for techniques, but I would love to hear more::\n<ul><li>Irony Channels:  A channel/thread/whatever where (for instance) I as the GM can go and post secrets that have not yet been revealed.  Players would, of course, not go into that channel, because that would ruin their fun.  But some <i>spectators</i> might find it more fun to observe the game knowing that (for instance) Princess Hurronen only treats Blood-wind Jessie so shoddily because she's secretly attracted to him ... and to have a place to jaw about the implications of that ("Oh MAN!  He doesn't even begin to know how what he just said comes across to her!") without risk of revealing the secrets.  Of course, players would have their own Irony Channels as well, which the GM (and other players) would be barred from.</li>\n<li>Spectator Channel:  A channel which anyone (including players and GM) could read, but which only Spectators could post to ... a private place for the audience to chatter back and forth to themselves.</li>\n<li>Separate IC and OOC channels:  This strikes me as a necessity ... many spectators really don't care how the rules and rolls work out, they just want to follow the unfolding soap opera.</li>\n<li>Deliberately short sessions and player-churn:  Structure the game in such a way that if a spectator gets jazzed about it, and wants their turn playing in that world, there's a clear-cut end of the previous session and beginning of the next, where the group that's playing gets shaken up and changed</li></ul>\nI've also heard, in discussions elsewhere, that spectators are very concerned with being able to come up to speed without laboriously sifting through a billion poorly sorted and un-indexed messages.  I'm torn about whether I think a better table-of-contents is really the best solution to that.  I mean, I read through all of <i>Sluggy Freelance</i> when I first heard about it (and when that was only a couple of years of backlog), so I understand the appeal of giving the eager new fans a rite of passage they can perform.  But at the same time, I feel like it should be possible to get people up to speed on what's happening, and able to participate, without forcing them to that sort of labor.  I've been thinking more along the lines of "Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...", but don't know whether it serves the same social purpose as reading the logs.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57770/#Comment_57770" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T06:13:53+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  6:13AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Allen Varney wrote a blog-based RPG called Noteworthy.
