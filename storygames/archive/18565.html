Unlike a game with ordinary folk who can just throw a punch, fire a pistol, etc, there are a lot of factors I have to consider: different scifi weapons as well as Kungfu abilities all mean that calculating damage in particular can be a real chore. I want to avoid that as much as possible without completely fudging it. I don\u2019t want to have the attacker add abilities, weapon damage, modifiers etc \u2013 then do the same with defence \u2013 then calculate the amount of damage. <br/><br/>I am, at the moment, working with a simple hit point system (Chi points \u2013 once gone = death). What I propose is to resolve combat with an opposed roll and to have all those variables replaced by what I currently call \u2018combat resources\u2019. These include weapons, abilities, armour, etc. Characters will have some combination of these and the purpose of each is to provide a pool of expendable resources. Spending these on an attack/defence adds dice to the roll. If the attack succeeds, the difference is applied as damage (using a d6 pool mechanism comparing totals). <br/>So for example: The attacker has a Guns skill of 3 and has a pair of laser pistols as combat resources (keeping it simple, nothing else); each has a pool of 2 points. He can spend any or all of those points to increase his Guns skill, the dice pool, which is rolled to attack. The defender has Evade of 2 and a suit of Ancestral Armour which has a pool of 5 points. Likewise he can spend those to increase his chances.<br/><br/>Now the obvious wrinkle is that these resources are finite. There are two things I say to that: firstly it allows for a more tactical combat approach. I\u2019m not trying to create a hugely complicated system, this is an action oriented game, but it\u2019s still an rpg and tactics has to play a part (otherwise every combat and every combatant becomes the same and gets boring if nothing else). Secondly it\u2019s a case of what works. It will be possible to replenish resources, in various and simple ways, so a suit of armour won\u2019t be useless after its points are spent. This also does away with having to use actions to change weapon and such like; instead a simple action taken to replenish \u2013 a tactical choice \u2013 and you\u2019re golden.<br/><br/>I am a ways off from a playtest version, but I wanted to know if the idea had any viability or whether it\u2019s something so toxic that even playtesting it would be a waste of time, if no one would ever want to play a game with such rules. I don\u2019t know of any other game that works this way so if there are any obvious pitfalls, let me know.

Out of combat it's much simpler; just go back to base or rest or whatever. <br/><br/>The problem would be from managing different elements (physical resources like guns, special powers) and so it would have to be simple.<br/><br/>There will be a generic 'x point' resource: to add dice to actions which will be used for most cases. So if you want to reload your gun, or 'replenish' your armour you take a turn to pay x points and get your resources back. Simple resource management.<br/><br/>It's not intended to be 100% realistic, and even so I think tracking a hundred different dependent resources would be too much. You could for instance have characters go to the market before combat and 'stock up' on a meta resource, 'ammo', for instance (which they'd have to acquire using 'money' - another resource), to then replenish arms in combat.<br/><br/>The only real issue is for special powers. I wasn't originally going to use points to fuel these (like the abilities in Qin, using Chi or some such) simply because it seems boring. Feng Shui, for the most part, lets players use their shticks freely. In games where Chi is used it simply means the player runs out, can't do anything, and then afterward has to go sleep at the nearby inn/motel (which is no challenge at all) to recover. It isn't an interesting experience. This system hints at working that way, which I'm not terribly keen on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417530/#Comment_417530" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T05:13:01+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  5:13AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I really like the idea of a combat system that incentivises taking different actions rather than always the same old "I hit him with my broadsword for d8 damage". This reminds me a bit of Dogs in the Vineyard, which does a similar thing (albeit you only get to use each thing once, and everything auto-refreshes after a conflict is over).<br/><br/>My one problem with it is: you get a different kind of repetitiveness. I always go for my Guns first because they're rated higher than my laser pistol. Then I go for my laser pistol, and last my fists. Unless I'm saving up for the Big Bad, in which case, the opposite. So, is there a way to make it a bit less samey? I think forcing you to rest in order to refresh helps a bit, because you're having to hold something in reserve for future encounters.<br/><br/>I think my answer would be: make sure each resource does something more than just add a bonus. If each resource does something different, then maybe I'll choose the tool for the job rather than just picking based on the size of the bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417541/#Comment_417541" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T06:29:16+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  6:29AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This doesn't mean any tool for any job: a laser pistol would be used at range while an unarmed weapon won't, even if they confer the same resource points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/geordie%20racer" title="geordie racer"><img alt="geordie racer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/geordie%20racer">geordie racer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417545/#Comment_417545" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T06:49:15+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  6:49AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea, I suppose you could have a Contacts skill with say, a cult and an AI as resources.

A couple of thoughts:  <br/>-Powers refresh by descriptively recharging them.  You have to narrate a scene of how your guy meditates, prepares his herbs, visits the temple etc.  It's maybe only a little more interesting than resting at the inn.  <br/><br/>-Powers refresh from in-story awesomeness.  When you accomplish goals, when you save a life, when you please the gods, etc.  Refresh points could be awarded like fan mail (PTA) or drama dice (7th Sea).  This could mean that if you use your power in a really cool, creative way, it refreshes instantly.  <br/><br/>-Powers refresh from mechanical awesomeness.  You critical hit, your power refreshes.  You hit three times in a row, your power refreshes.  <br/><br/>-Powers refresh from mechanical weakness/failure, or when you really need them.  When you are down to 1/2 health, your power refreshes.  When you are down to 1 health, your power refreshes.  When an ally goes down, your power refreshes.<br/><br/>-Powers are drawn from the user's body and soul, and overdoing it is bad for you.  You can trade health for a power refresh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417558/#Comment_417558" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T09:51:04+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  9:51AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may exempt powers from this system and simply have them give fixed effects/bonuses.

Even after asking you thousands of times and in different ways for feedback and details of your game, only to receive vague answers from you? I'm not sure, perhaps it was a different person or game, that's why I'm asking, though that phrase you used "I don't think this idea is going to work" -in all it's variants- was all the feedback we got from the OP at that time and it was soooooo frustrating and useless as a feedback that it didin't took that thread anywhere, it became a waste of precious time for the OP and all the people who wrote there and it even made us think that Ron Edwards was right when he closed the Forge, if he had to suffer this kind of torture for trying to lend a hand.<br/><br/>Probably I'm wrong, though just for the sake of our mental health, don't use that phrase here please, nor it's variants for that matter. We won't be able to help you if you just keep saying "that won't work" instead of explaining in detail <i>why</i>. On top of that, saying "I don't think this is going to work" doesn't stand a chance against "I've tried this idea and did/didn't work for me". If you tried and it didn't work, fine, let's go into another approach. If you haven't, please don\xb4t go "I think..." on us.

This is utterly counter productive and frankly manipulative.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no idea how you have come to the conclusion that I have no taken feedback nor engaged with you, when i have replied directly to what was said. In fact in response to the original Nechronica AP link I said this:<br/><br/><br/>"Thanks for the link, but I'm not seeing what's different about it."<br/><br/>Which was not answered. Perhaps others should examine their own posting habits before criticising mine.
