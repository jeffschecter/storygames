Let their actions play out, but if the city's player acts in a scene towards one of the PCs (say, lunging at them), have the PCs roll instead of him. This might be a tricky part, since it might come off as limiting their agency - but arguably allows them a more interesting fictional position as the "actor" rather than the reactor.<br/><br/>That being said, coordinate with the player. You're on relatively similar teams, I'd say - you're both playing the world, in a messy intertwined way. You play the corporate heads or whatever, and they play the people who have been affected by their trickle-down influence. Being open and direct about your plans seems like a good idea for achieving the effect of "playing this little chunk of the world".<br/><br/>Hope this helps!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477244/#Comment_477244" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-26T17:53:58+00:00" title="October 26, 2018  5:53PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the possibilities and ideas, if you mean the premise, have you read <a href="http://www.john-shirley.com/books/City_Come_A_Walkin.html" rel="nofollow">City Come A-Walkin'</a>?<br/><br/>Basically, the city is the sentient universal unconscious of all of San Francisco.

When the PCs hit the streets, the city may get them lost or take them to unexpected places.

This works with all player authored traits, that is Fate, but also Risus. <br/>An easy way to tone the city influence down is to put a sort of field ("influence" here, "Gauntlet" in Mage the Ascension). The "city field" is weak or strong (according to rolls or why not hidden triggers, like some we can gather from the Lacuna AP on this forum). <br/><br/>Sorcerer and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hystoire_de_fou" rel="nofollow">Hystoire de fou</a> can replicate this because the "field" force also shows - from a reciprocal perspective - how deep into paranoia the character is.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477427/#Comment_477427" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-02T16:06:20+00:00" title="November  2, 2018  4:06PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, before everyone spill their blood here, please go back to Paul's thread <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21109/a-thin-crescent-moon-hangs-sickly-pale/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21109/a-thin-crescent-moon-hangs-sickly-pale/p1</a> and read it carefully.
