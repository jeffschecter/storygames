For example, if an NPC attempts to mug the PC, and the PC is capable (as determined by his traits) of violence and the PC chooses to do so to stop the mugging, there would be no doubt that the PC succeeds.  The dice would, however, determine whether the PC just roughs up the mugger and runs him off, or whether the PC, for example, takes the mugger's gun and shoots him 5 times in the head.<br/>under this idea, choosing not to be violent, and thus allowing the mugging to occur, would have negative story effects (the PC is mugged!) but positive mechanical effects (accruing some form of player currency to spend to exert greater control over the outcome of other events).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment"

For example, in order to achieve something through violence, the character would need to have the Psychotic Rage (or some better, more appropriate name.  i'm bad with names) trait.  If the player chose to do so, he would definitely succeed, but might end up being <i>more</i> violent than he needs/wants to be.  On the other hand, he could chose not to use the Rage (resulting in the character "failing" the conflict) but would earn a point of some kind.<br/><br/>oh, also, something I guess I forgot to ask in my original post: How do you feel about systems in which you never roll against the GM or NPCs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193716/#Comment_193716" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T12:32:41+00:00" title="February 23, 2009 12:32PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to look at The Committee For the Exploration of Mysteries.<br/><br/>It has opposition but success is guaranteed.  It's hard to describe exactly how it works.  Basically the opposition player rolls a bunch of d10s which sum up to a target number.  The acting player then tosses narration back and forth between himself and the opposition.  Each time the active player narrates he puts forward two d6s pulled various sources.  Then the opposition narrates a set back.  Back and forth.<br/><br/>The idea is that the active player is trying accumulate enough d6s to be the TN rolled on the d10s... in under three minutes of real time.  This is key.<br/><br/>If time runs out one of two things happens.  If the player has enough d6s in front of him to beat the TN and he simply didn't have enough time to play them then the obstacle is literately hand-waved away.  You just assume that he did beat it... somehow.  You just never say how.<br/><br/>If on the other hand the player DOESN'T have enough d6s in front of him to beat the TN then every player in the group loses a resource.  You go around the group and each player narrates how they contributed to the eventual defeat of the obstacle and why it cost them a resource.  But again, success is guaranteed.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

PCs roll and try to beat the number. Drama Points may be spent by PCs to give themselves sizable bonuses.  When NPCs act against PCs, the PCs roll a resistance attribute or skill and again try to beat the NPC/challenges' rating. No NPC ever rolls dice unless they are a Giant Monstar.<br/><br/>This is more like Lacuna than the direction that the rest of the thread went in, tho. The possibility of failure or bad consequences even for minor challenges does exist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193812/#Comment_193812" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T19:46:25+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  7:46PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Complicated allows players to choose whether or not their characters succeed at anything they try, as long as they're the one in control of the scene. There's zero external opposition. Of course, the game has a very different, character-and-personality-driven engine than most stuff out there, so I don't know if this helps or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194017/#Comment_194017" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T18:33:21+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  6:33PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about games with "internal" opposition?
