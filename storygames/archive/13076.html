The idea is a D&amp;D setting where there are no good or neutral people, creatures or gods, only variations of evil. A - designates something the player said, and a +++ indicates dice rolling)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou had just repelled the orcs from the deck of the Al-Uzza, and are descending upon The Stain to resupply the goblins and imps. Dekker Brandywine has been severely wounded, and Illith Saepire was killed in the fight, being thrown from the edge of the theurgeme.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the thick night, the city below looks like a giant burn upon the pale, wet grass of the land, embers still alight. Dekker lays in his quickly stiffening blood, and you cannot tell what is below you. There is a reeking stench in the dark air, and there is an unceasing cacophony of yelling and screaming from the city.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I bring the Al-Uzza down into the Stain<br/>\n<br/>\nA quarter-way across the city, you can make out an open space of cleared dirt. There is no other space like it, so you dash atop the quarterdeck and do your best to set the ship towards it.<br/>\n+++<br/>\nYou let your instincts take you as you direct Al-Uzza to the open spot. In synergy with the ship, you pull up slowly as you near the ground, positioning yourself perfectly above the spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeering over the ship, you count nine hobgoblin, human and dwarven men run from the shadows that ensconce the city. They wear rutted scale mail armor and carry crossbows and swords.<br/>\n<br/>\n"The captain of this vessel will identify himself at once!" hollers a large hobgoblin, standing in the orange gleam illuminating the dirt as the city's fires reflect off of the theurgeme.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I look at the incapacitated Dekker then yell "I am captain Aedan Howe!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hobgoblin replies with a shout, "Bring your first mate, advisors or staff with you from your ship, and we will discuss payment for docking." There is a bright, orange explosion to the northeast, erupting like lightning from the lightless city, then falling into a low fire.<br/>\n<br/>\n-My first mate is badly injured and needs healing!<br/>\n<br/>\n"Bring him, too! We'll get our healer!" The hobgoblin nods to one of the humans, who jogs off into the darkness.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I grab Dekker and drag him off the ship<br/>\n<br/>\nYou slide the gangway from the main deck, and it thumps into the eerie, flickering orange dirt in a puff of dust. Carrying Dekker down in a cleric's-lift, you lay him before the hobgoblin and his men, who watch the shadows behind them and adjacent to the Al-Uzza, where your adjusting eyes now pick up tall iron bars cordoning off the landing area. A wind blows past you, bringing the smell of fire, blood and s***. Emerging from a low building within the open area come the freakishly scarred human warrior and a tiny kobold in a gown, with the holy symbol of Kurtulmak around its neck.<br/>\n<br/>\n"First, how long do you want to dock your ship here, and what do you have to offer for it?" asks the tall hobgoblin warily. He watches your body, not your eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe human approaches. "Here's Kik. Doubt he can do s*** for beardy," he says, gesturing to Dekker.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I just need to stay long enough for supplies (whats my inventory?)<br/>\n<br/>\nRapier (will become as hot as the user pleases)\u2028Scimitar (carries a constant lightning charge)\u2028Hunting Knife (extremely cold at all times)\u2028Leather Armor (studded and will match surroundings like a chameleon)\u2028Bullwhip\u2028Combat Boots\u20284 fire opals, 1 bloodstone, 1 alexandrite\u2028Rod: Grim Revenge, 2 charges\u2028A green dragon scale\u2028Devilroot\u2028A bag of gunpowder\u202811 lead balls\u2028A blunderbuss\u2028Throwing Axe\u2028Bandage Kit<br/>\n<br/>\n"Okay," says the hobgoblin, "for this evening maximum, then. What's your offer?"<br/>\n<br/>\n-I have some fire opals, will those do?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the dwarves spits, fingers tapping on his crossbow's pitted body. "That's a start," the hobgoblin says, "hand over something magical, too, and you've got your berth."<br/>\n<br/>\n-I hold up the rod of grim revenge "Will this do?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"What's it do?"<br/>\n<br/>\n-I smile evilly, "Shall I demonstrate?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hobgoblin's eight men raise their crossbows and point them at you, strings taut, faces hard. The hobgoblin frowns and spits. "Say something flippant again on my lot and you'll be a f****** pincushion. What's it do?"<br/>\n<br/>\n-"Its a rod of Grim Revenge, tears off someones hand an chokes em to death with it" I look at it for a moment then say, "It works against Dragons"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Ye yip yish ka koo ya yeel!" squeaks the kobold. The hobgoblin nods thoughtfully. "Okay... good. Very good. Let's have it here." The men lower their crossbows, but a few keep their eyes on you. "We'll have Kik give your man a once-over, but no promises." He looks critically upon Brandywine, whose dozens of raw cuts ooze droplets of blood here and there.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I hand the fire opals and the rod of grim revenge to the Hobgoblin<br/>\n<br/>\nHe accepts them and hands them off to another hobgoblin wearing a burlap hood. Out of the corner of your eye, you see an imp abscond from the deck of Al-Uzza and land nearby, gesturing you to come over to him. The hobgoblin states quietly, "You can resupply all you want, but it's a f****** warzone in the city, at all times. There's a market directly to the west from here that's pretty well defended. Prices are cheap, so the food is chancy. If someone attacks you, kill them as loudly as you can to scare off the locals. Don't buy drugs from anyone but traveling merchants, and don't go to any brothels or f*** any street whores. The girls here that aren't bait for traps have diseases that will make your skin melt."<br/>\n<br/>\n-"How pleasant, I'll be about my business then" I turn to the imp and aproach to find out what it wants<br/>\n<br/>\nIt squeaks feverishly, "When ye find food, cap'm, give this 'ere stone a lick and huck it at th' sky. We'll come a-wingin' an' haul it back, sight?" He holds out a small, grey stone with a rune on it. "Be quick if ye please, we a'ready ate Glon'il an' Baz."<br/>\n<br/>\n-"Understood, make sure no one steals the ship"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe diminutive, bright-red imp nods, panting, and flaps back to the deck.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I head towards the market and keep my sword drawn<br/>\n<br/>\nYou approach the gate out of the landing area, which consists of a small door built into the bars. Guarding it is a white-haired dark elf carrying a halberd. He lets you through onto the filthy dirt street outside. Lining the sides of the path are cardboard, aluminum and dilapidated wooden houses. Bits of wood, metal and s*** blanket the street, and there are a pair of young men sagging dead to your left. You cannot make out their wounds in the darkness, but one looks like he's missing his head. There are bits of flame in some of the houses, and the ever-present screams and yells continue. Far down the street, you can see what looks like a tiny castle, lit up against the oppressive blackness of The Stain at night.<br/>\nThere are skitters here and there as humanoids move about.<br/>\n<br/>\n(We ended here)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
