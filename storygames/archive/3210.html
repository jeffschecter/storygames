There are others, too; these three are just the most distinctly stylised that I have, so they stick out in my memory. These games make me happy. I enjoy reading them because of the sheer beauty of their language, and the sense that the author has written them with attention and joy.</p>\n<p>There are some games that are <em>designed</em> but not <em>written</em> and I enjoy playing these, right, but I'm disinterested in reading them, so I end up not playing them.

I think the setting parts of TSOY, that was one of them too. If a game makes me work to get through the rules... Well, I'll play along as long as I know in advance that the payout is good.

I want someone else to teach me the rules and the feel of the game, and run it for me."<br/><br/>In fact, I did such a thing recently.  I got a group of AGON players together, saying that I want to play, I want someone else to run, and if that person ran the game for us in say, 4 sessions, I'd buy them a copy of the corebook in advance.* It worked out extremely well, actually, and I was very satisfied with the result: Learning the rules and feel of the game, without having to rely on getting through all the text myself.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Remi ended up running, and waived his Corebook Fee (though I was totally going to hook him up); instead he had me buy a present for a friend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73198/#Comment_73198" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T12:07:06+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 12:07PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it is this very concern that is driving me to make sweet agatha.

In fact the most extensive use of the game in a world where we play the games is to reference rules during play.  To that end a large number of games actively get in the way of being useful rule-books by being literary successes.  Obviously (I think) if the writing is so that the game can't be discerned or if it's just such a burden to try to decode that it's not worth it, then it fails in both categories.  But I think that a game that succeeds as a great read and fails as a game aid pretty much fails, period.<br/><br/>To that end, good organization first.  I like some good game-themed fiction but it can't be a hindrance to finding a rule while I'm playing because the one thing I'm not going to be doing is reading the book to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73313/#Comment_73313" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T03:06:56+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  3:06AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2007 3:13AM by shreyas.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I do not think organisation is on-topic for this thread.

It's the difference between, say, <em>Dogs</em>, which gives you this very evocative tour of the ethos of the game, and <em>Shock:</em> which goes about discussing how to build science fiction stories.  The intent, and the underlying structure, is very different, and gives rise to very different texts.<br/><br/>Or maybe you're talking about something totally different.

As you (more or less) say, everyone would prefer text to be well-written. No-one I know likes to battle their way through a book.<br/><br/>You seem to be suggesting that if an author wants you to "approach a text as art ", you will be more likely to enjoy reading it. I'm left wondering why you think that. Is it that you want to get more from reading a game text that simply acquiring the information it communicates? And you think a declaration of "read my text as art" is a good indication that the author intends to give you more than just information? If so, I can see that might be true, though said author also would have to bear in mind all the people that such a declaration would deter.<br/><br/>I'm also curious about how many other kinds of texts you run up against in life that you won't read because they're not rewarding enough. I would have thought it might make things rather difficult for you. But that's another matter!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73445/#Comment_73445" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-03T12:54:51+00:00" title="June  3, 2007 12:54PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently we're in agreement, then, Shreyas. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73505/#Comment_73505" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T01:01:31+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  1:01AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, I can't think of a game that is well-written in a <i>technical</i> sense but not in an <i>arty</i> sense. That is, I can't think of a game that functions well as a rules manual that isn't, also, written artistically, in some sense.<br/><br/>If I think about clearly written books, I think about My Life With Master (which has a gothic, literary voice to the text); the Shab al-Hiri Roach (dry and ironic); Dogs In The Vineyard (conversational and occasionally beautiful). All of those are artistically written, in some sense: the text would lose something if it was reduced to a numbered instruction list.<br/><br/>I'm probably just echoing Shreyas' original point here.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
