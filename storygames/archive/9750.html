Over on Vincent Baker's anyway blog there was a discussion of <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=440" rel="nofollow">Magically magic</a> .<br/><br/>Ron Edwards had this to say <br/><br/>"I also have a soft spot for the Fighting Fantasy solo books, especially the brilliant Crown of Kings four-book set. The magic mechanic was decidedly un-modern, in that you the player had to cast spells based on memory alone, and if you mis-remembered (a system based on the honor code while following the numbers in the book), then funky stuff happened. Plus the spell effects themselves were 100% standard and have been duplicated in every imaginable CRPG. But somehow, given both the amazing take on fantasy itself (very underground comix) and the artwork, the magic felt rich and ever-present in play itself.<br/><br/>Boy I'd like to understand how that feel could be so strong when the literal content of the actions was so basic. I hope the Old School Renaissance takes note."<br/><br/>What I liked about the FF books was the magic had to me remebered (by me) and I didn't quite know what the outcome would be. Depending on where you were in the book spells would manifest themselves in different ways. <br/><br/>The spells in the FF book were listed like this:<br/>WAL<br/>The casting of this spell creates an invisible wall in front of the caster. This wall is impervious to all missles, creatures, etc. It is a very useful defensive spell.<br/><br/>Would this system work in a multi player table top setting and how? Thoughts...<br/><br/>My initial thoughts would be that spells effect would vary based on what is going on in the fiction. But this would mostly be ad hoc and I was having trouble coming up with a simple (OD&amp;D style) mechanics.<br/><br/>ara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216460/#Comment_216460" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T00:42:33+00:00" title="July  5, 2009 12:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a very interesting topic for me, since I also loved the Sorcery series mentioned above, and have recently been having a ball with OD&amp;D in the form of Swords &amp; Wizardry.<br/><br/>Some off the cuff things that occur to me as I think about this.<br/><br/>In Sorcery, you had a large number of spells you could cast (compared to a typical D&amp;D wizard), but when opportunities for spell casting arose, you'd only be presented with a small number of them (like 3 or 4).  The challenge of spell casting was two-fold, picking the most appropriate spell for the situation at hand from the selection offered, and also remembering what the spells actually were, since the choice would be offered in terms of the three letter code names.<br/><br/>So the key concept here is, choice of spell as puzzle solving vs. classic D&amp;D choice of spell as tactical action.<br/><br/>I'm also put in mind of the spell casting mechanism that was used the one time I played True Dungeon. It involved selecting the right combination of runes on some sort of gadget (my memory is hazy), I believe it was a dial of some kind.  You sad what spell you wanted to cast, then showed the GM what runs you had picked, and if you got it right, the spell worked, and if not...<br/><br/>And now that I'm thinking along these lines, there was the reagent mixing in Ultima IV that was similar.<br/><br/>So um, what advice out of all this rambling?  Well to make memorization a fun &amp; challenging thing, there needs to be a significant number of spells to memorize, so the OD&amp;D think of "your wizard knows 3 spells to start" is probably not going to be good.  I remember from playing Sorcery that I started with a small handful of spells that I could reliably identify, and then as I played more and more gradually expanded my repertoire.  But somebody who was good at memorizing or had played alot could go back to the earlier books and use the full array of spells.  But also, the fact that spell choice was limited in each situation was also a gating factor.<br/><br/>I'd be curious to know if any of these idea show up in your OD&amp;D clone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216470/#Comment_216470" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T05:07:44+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  5:07AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2009 5:09AM by frozenwastes.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love adding cards and props.  So what about if you had a small deck of cards, one for each spell.  You'd deal out a number of them equal to your level (perhaps level +1, +2 or  1.5x or twice your level), face down.  On the back of the card, would be the three letter memory code for the spell.  FIR, SLE, BIG, SHI, LIG, TEN, PRI, WIS, etc.,.  On the front of the card is the spell text.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can flip over and use any one spell of your choice.  It gets used up until you rest.  You'd then replace the card with a new one from the small deck.  Perhaps you can shuffle the remaining deck any time you catch a moment to rest?<br/><br/>Once per round/turn you can simply discard one of your available cards and replace it with the top card from the deck.<br/><br/>Your used spells that have been discarded and shuffled back into the deck after you sleep and study your spell book.<br/><br/>Double the number of spells a wizard knows from each level to provide more variety.  Or you could theoretically make all spells they can cast available to them.  Any increase in the size of the deck decreases the reliability of the deck as well as increasing the player's resources.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216489/#Comment_216489" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T09:32:05+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  9:32AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya rafial,<br/><br/>   My initial thoughts were to have the player memorize spells like you suggested here. I am not sure how well that will go over with some folks. I like the way you worded tactical choice vs puzzle. <br/><br/>  nathanh,<br/>    The idea of random cards intrigues me too. <br/><br/>So if you give the spellcaster player something fiddling a puzzle like to do, do you also need to provide the fighter and theif types with something as well?
