As you might [or not] know it, I've been working a lot in the last months to prepare a KickStarter campaign. We have reached an important milestone today, as our video is ready.<br/><br/>The video can be found here:<br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-NO9Vpf_LtDo?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO9Vpf_LtDo"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/NO9Vpf_LtDo/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>At that point, I really want to focus (and get feedbacks) for the video in particular (and note the all KS page). Some comments/questions:<br/>- This video is not 100% what we envisionned. But, at some point, the project needs to be launch. That said, we intend to improve it during the course of the campaign (we might even have a new version for the launch of the campaign).<br/>- One of the main concern/challenge we are facing with this project is 'to get customers into the store'. We need, in our opinion, to find a way to get people to take a closer look at our material, download our pdf, for instance. Does this video helps us with this concern?<br/>- The video is quite long (more than 7 minutes), but we tried very hard to give it a good rythm, so people could watch it from beginning to end. What do you think?<br/>- Any advices to give us? Comments?<br/><br/>Thanks again for your time and interest.<br/><i>If you ever want to check our KS page, in preview mode, it can be found <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/671321082/1879808645?token=d8e09677" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429849/#Comment_429849" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T14:07:59+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  2:07PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I know that since it combines a setting feature as well as the tool to run the game itself, those are both elements that you want to discuss in the video. I think from a business standpoint, the tool and system is your more unique selling point, and the video should focus more specifically on that. While the setting is interesting and clearly could be used to create a lot of great campaigns, I think it is tertiary to this pitch video.!</blockquote>\nFirst, thanks for the kind word. Yeap, the video could be shorter, but the project is <i>a little bit</i> complex, so that's the choice we took.<br/><br/>About the 'selling point': I agree with you, you have no idea. Now, the reality: I've been presenting this project over and over again for the past years. There is no way to sell a website (with the tools). And it is so, that I had to made some serious changes to my KS campaign. At first, our 'price range' was 50% for the campaign and 50% for the website. At the moment, we're almost giving the website access ... it might have a lot of value, but it is <i>not perceived</i> that way.<br/>On the other hand, selling a campaign, fully illustrated as Avalanche is, is quite simpler (<i>and yeah, for sure it comes with a website access, we'll see that later</i>). It is typical. That was not the initial plan. I'm not saying I'll succeed in my KS, but at least I won't be struggling with the explanations for the website along (I mean in terms of how much it is valued).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429864/#Comment_429864" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T15:24:34+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  3:24PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's a tough position to be in.

I don't even like videos as audience for advertising, I don't generally bother to watch e.g. Kickstarter campaign videos.<br/><br/>The video does a good job with staking the trad fantasy grounds - if that's something a person is fond of, that video will entice them, as the narrated imagery works well to evoke the genre. The bits about the structure of the campaign and the book, the timelines and social webs, is also presented in a basically appealing way - if you're somebody who's been thinking that they'd like to do this big campaign thing, except with modern relationship maps and such, then that'll attract attention.<br/><br/>Specific selling points that I made note of are the image of the bound book proof (a very reassuring thing to see a good-looking book already being pawed at), the female narrator with a touch of amateur aesthetic in her rendition, the visualization of the timeline and relationship elements, and the sweeping description of the epic fantasy backstory. Those are all things that I would expect to do well in selling the product here.<br/><br/>The bit that isn't working so well is the website integration argument: it comes up for real around the 6 minute mark, where the French-speaking guy is presented. That's much too late in the video to sell it as central, and an argument is never made for why it's central to the project, which all makes it look almost like an incidental sponsor advertisement. "We're making this cool, differently organized fantasy rpg campaign book, and oh here's our sponsor, they create websites." There is an annoying repeating grammar error in the text, too: "we've been developing website for ten years" or something like that, a pluralization mistake I think.<br/><br/>I suppose that the way to fix the above is to either rearrange the video and bolster the website explanation so that it explains clearly what use case the website answers, and so that the website comes up early on - basically when the timeline structure stuff is explained, or even before it. Alternatively, remove most of the website stuff and just add like two sentences to the structural explanation, noting that everything mentioned here would be available in a digital online interactive format well-suited to information management, created by your team with plenty of professional experience in website design - that's pretty much everything that needs to be said about the website thing, unless you want to really try to sell the audience on it. As the video stands, this subject is left precariously midway between an incidental remark and a full sales pitch.<br/><br/>I do not find the length of the video excessive, although I am also not a regular audience for such videos, so I might not realize how the audience psychology works in this regard. In practice I tuned out and did other stuff a few times, but came back when something interesting caught my ear. However, I would think that it's good for the video to be long enough for the audience to form an initial positive buying position while watching it; you want the potential customer to already be inclined to purchase when the finish the video, rather than it being so short that they're still pondering on it when they finish. The content of the video is not as important as its length in this regard, really, as it's just a psychological sales trick <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429889/#Comment_429889" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T20:56:50+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  8:56PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, I'm definitely no expert, but I found that people respond pretty well to a very short, teaser video as the main thing to hook people, and then a talking head or explanation that they can follow up with if they care or want more info.<br/><br/>If it were me, I think I'd put the cool flavor stuff as the teaser, and then the rest of the explanation and stuff as a video beneath it as an optional thing to click, because it's cool but I tuned out pretty quick as well unfortunately.

You touch on this nicely throughout the video, I'm just thinking a lot of the extra "fluff" is superfluous. I think most people would decide to buy in the first 2-3 minutes. </blockquote>\nJust to be clear on this: my project is a mess!! Yes, two or three minutes videos is the way to go, except in some cases. And yes, how strange as it may seem, we're comfortable with people feeling a little bit 'over the edge'. We want Avalanche to look big, epic. <i>Maybe a website to manage all of this might be useful</i>.\n<blockquote>Yeah, that's a tough position to be in.  I'm always torn between building the tool and building the application (or the system and the milieu, in the case of RPGs).

If I focus on building the system alone, I instantly cut my market by 90%.  I feel your pain.</blockquote>\nYou can't sell a system. Hear me well: I'm not talking about a game mechanic, I'm talking about a new way to present setting/plots, using, for instance, a new system of reference. You need to come up with an example of the type of product you envision.\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Aslf">@Aslf</a> without derailing too much, I think people are always eager to try new systems. I've rarely met an RPG enthusiast who is opposed to trying something new (despite what you may see on some internet communities.)</blockquote>\nSeriously, I can not sell my system. There's no way to raise 20K$ or 25K$ on KickStarter to finance a website like mine without an example in it. There is no public for this.\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/pells">@pells</a> what do you think is the single most powerful solution your product offers? </blockquote>\nI hope to make you smile here with all my mess ... I bring a solution about <i>stories</i>: how to present pre written material in a way that is useful for DM. And you know what? Nobody has a problem with stories. Seriously. There are various reasons for this (some hsitoric to our hobby), but this is as it is. <br/>I really think I'm bringing something very innovative and different to the old 'adventures modules' of our hobby. I think that the structure I'm presenting will change how games are played. Now, who cares? No way I can sell this that way. <br/><br/>More seriously, the gains from the website (and all rpg websites have the same): save preparation times, gather your notes, find information quickly, monitor the impact of your actions' players. My specific is that those gains are in the context of complex, large stories/campaigns. No one has that problem.<br/>I also have gains for Avalanche: high production value, challenging stories, a world that has a life of its own. <i>Now, that's a complex, large campaign!!!</i><br/><br/>I'd really like to present my reality: to finance my project, I need 500 DMs (more or less). And I think I can find them to <i>play</i> Avalanche, not to use some systems.\n<blockquote>The bit that isn't working so well is the website integration argument: it comes up for real around the 6 minute mark, where the French-speaking guy is presented.

There is an annoying repeating grammar error in the text, too: "we've been developing website for ten years" or something like that, a pluralization mistake I think.</blockquote>\nWell, now that is a real problem ... I think we have a solution. The website offers function based on Avalanche structure/system. If you understand one, you understand the other. We begin talking about the website (naming advantages) at 1:11. The first screenshot is shown at 1:33. We have a problem with this sequence; we didn't polished it enough ... We should be presenting screenshots with 'bullets points arguments' (Francis is talking about the design and the tool). That is what is unclear, I think.<br/>As for the French guy ... He's not our sponsor, he's just one member of the team (ux and marketing). Now, what might be confusing is the wireframes we're showing when he is talking. Those are our portfolio, to show we can do websites ... now, as I read, maybe we don't need that part to prove it. Is removing it altogether seems like the better solution?<br/>Do I make sense here?\n<blockquote>Now, I'm definitely no expert, but I found that people respond pretty well to a very short, teaser video as the main thing to hook people, and then a talking head or explanation that they can follow up with if they care or want more info.</blockquote>\nThat works fine with projects like yours': people know what they are buying!!! You just to present the 'features/themes' and you do it perfectly. Honestly (and I have thought of that), if I was only financing finishing Avalanche and the players' book, that would be 6K$ KickStarter campaign ... and I would do a 3 minutes video, only presenting the cool story.<br/>\n<blockquote>If it were me, I think I'd put the cool flavor stuff as the teaser, and then the rest of the explanation and stuff as a video beneath it as an optional thing to click, because it's cool but I tuned out pretty quick as well unfortunately. The rest of the page is pretty nice and really well done I think</blockquote>\nSee, and that's fine like this: what I hear is that you watched the whole thing. Maybe you did something else in the meantime, maybe I didn't get all your attention, but you watched it. I do watch KS videos everyday: videos that I watch from beginning to end is about 10%. And a quick note: we will be updating, at least once a week this video during all the course of our campaign.\n<blockquote>One thing I would change in the video is to start with "A long time ago..." until perhaps "... changing them forever" - and only then cut to you talking to the viewer. </blockquote>\nYou don't like me (the plant almost looks more alive than me)?

We ran ads on Facebook more than usual yesterday. <br/>In fact, we have three main problems:<br/>1. Banners don't display. We tried running banners thru google ads, but they don't print. I spent 8 cents in a day earlier this week.<br/><br/>2. So we're posting banners on therpgsite and on BGG/RPGG. But we can't see those numbers. I don't know how many impressions I make, how many people click on them (what is called 'clic thru rate' CTR). The analytic on KickStarter is just painful. You may see where the backers come from not the trafic. And this trafic is hard to quantify. I'm kind of blind folded here.<br/><br/>3. We ran ads on Facebook. Now, I'm used to running ads on Facebook. We've got some pretty good CTR (about 2%, knowing that you'd be happy to have 0,2%) and 76% of people who clicked on our ads come to 'like us'. Now we were running ads driving trafic to our KickStarter page. Conversion would be a backer instead of 'like'. And we were also targeting specifically our 1,4K likers. Turns out we had two backers coming from Facebook. Yesterday, 200 people came from Facebook to my KS page and I've got only two backers. 1% conversion rate!! Also, we had difficulties at the start of the day. Our CTR dropped to very low numbers but we made some changes (running at 1% actually).<br/><br/>A last stat maybe: I am at 239 views of my video, 19% completed. I'm really just at the beginning.<br/><br/>Good news is that we spent less money than expected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430233/#Comment_430233" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T12:44:34+00:00" title="March 29, 2014 12:44PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I work in PPC/SEM in my day job, let me know if you need any help with Adwords or Bing.

You can get good results with less money than with AdWords. I've spent money to 'pre qualify' my customers. Those are my 1400 likes. I want to turn them over into backers. And I'm running ads in two different demographics. 0 sales (or almost) out of my 1400 likers?!? Some [good] news: we've only got 1 unlike and we've added 9 organic likes. Our posts got liked, many comments (many 'cool'). No backers. There's a couple of things I will be trying next week. I think I can send more ads, but in a different way. If you wanna look, my page is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Existanc3" rel="nofollow">there</a>.\n<blockquote>Do you have any previews sent out to reviewers/blogs? </blockquote>\nWell, more or less. That's my next step. I've got an interview planned on Monday. My video only came late and it was close to the launch date. I had just hoped to begin this next step with more backers. My campaign is six weeks long, I have time. But yes, it is my weak spot. But, its my first project, I was missing material ...<br/>I'm also going to address crowds of players of system. 13th Age for instance. I need to find DMs.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, thanks a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
