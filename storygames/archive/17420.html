An hour before the game starts, create a Skype group conversation with the players. Send messages every fifteen minutes in a countdown. We do this so that everyone knows that the other people are online and that no last-minute shenanigans have occurred that will prevent the session from starting.<br/><br/>2. Start the group call. <br/><br/>3. Deal with the inevitable technology problems. People fail to connect. People\u2019s computers give off purple smoke. Google Chrome decides that it hates Infrno and new versions of Flash must be installed. People are attacked by badgers etc. <br/><br/>4. Once we have achieved a stable connection, do some general chit-chat for a few minutes. Touch base. <br/><br/>5. Do the pre-session mechanical work. Flag stats, handle xp expenditures, reset token pools etc. <br/><br/>6. Run through a recap. My recaps are extensive in that they take about twenty minutes and go over pretty much everything that happened in the previous session. <br/><br/>7. Take a break. Everyone gets a drink and uses the bathroom.<br/><br/>8. Start the game, this typically happens around 45 minutes after the group call starts. <br/><br/>How do you and your group do it?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394443/#Comment_394443" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T08:59:31+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  8:59AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done a little bit of Skype gaming, but mostly I use G+ Hangout. <br/><br/>Usually, I do all paperwork (choosing stats, XP, what-have-you) in the discussion thread the day before the game.<br/><br/>If playing with people in other time zones, I also try to post in the thread exactly 24 hours before the game starts, along with a message like, "The game will start in exactly 24 hours, so check out the timestamp if you're not sure when it's going to be."<br/><br/>Most of the time, the games that I play over Hangout are in-character (no breaking character until it's over), so it's crucial that everyone starts at the same time. A minute before game time, I post "Ready?" in the thread, and when all players have responded in the affirmative, I launch the Hangout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394445/#Comment_394445" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T09:09:40+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  9:09AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2012 9:11AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not so much a ritual, but I find it extremely hard to open the game session without saying "Alright..." prior to explaining the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394446/#Comment_394446" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T09:58:53+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  9:58AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Not so much a ritual, but I find it extremely hard to open the game session without saying "Alright..." prior to explaining the scene.</blockquote>\nHa!

There's pre-game, and then there's post-pre -- these are both ritualized cigarette breaks that last forever -- or more concretely, somewhere in the realm of five minutes to three hours.<br/><br/>If I'm running a game, I tend to ask a player to begin telling a recap of what happened last time.  These are typically brief, taking probably one to three minutes, just the highlights.<br/><br/>I usually start with "So," or if I'm stalling, "So..."  I seem to recall most GMs I've played with have a sort of ritualized phrase that signifies the game is beginning, but at the same time, I've having trouble remembering what any of them are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394724/#Comment_394724" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T05:13:36+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  5:13AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of our groups has got in to the habit of the ritual phrase 'Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer' despite the fact we've never actually played BtVS. It kind of means 'let's start trying to remember what happened last time and start playing.' <br/><br/>Perversly the group I play BtVS has the GM putting his screen up as the 'we're about to start' action. Prior to that it's just talking bollocks as normal. <br/><br/>I've played a one shot with someone who was looking to formalise the 'game starts at X, turn up an hour before X if you want to talk about one on one character stuff or non-game stuff' which was a bit rigid for me although they also highlighted 'talk about what day/week you've had and how that's effecting your mood at the moment' as part of it which I thought was quite clever. The argument was if you've spent the day dealing with tough paper trails at work you might not be in the mood to spend the evening chasing convoluted clue trails in character and having that on the table allows everyone to tailor the game a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbinc" title="jbinc"><img alt="jbinc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/106/nFRMKD4VH4ILG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbinc">jbinc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394733/#Comment_394733" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T06:07:21+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  6:07AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group tends to play over Skype/Roll20. At least one of the players won't stay much later than 10 (he usually has an early start at work the following day) so I aim to get people sorted by 8, so we have a solid 2 hours of play.<br/><br/>Most of the pre-play banter is done by email during the day, or Steam, Skype etc. Personally, I spent most of the hour before sorting out character sheets and other notes but jumped on Skype about 15 minutes before we were due to start as an unofficial way of opening proceedings. As this session was a bit unusual (we had 2 guys who had played previously, and 2 newbies joining in) I started things off by asking the two veterans to recap the last game. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">@w00hoo</a> and Jack, I like the idea of opening the session further in advance for technical problems and small talk - gauging everyone's mood (and internet connection!) beforehand seems like a smart move. Last session we had some pretty tragic trouble with roll20 which delayed things. Next time, I'm going to try a combination of Skype and rolz.org, which should be enough for our needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394738/#Comment_394738" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T06:47:30+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  6:47AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that asking people specifically how they're feeling that week, and touching base with people repeatedly during the game, is really important when you're playing in a situation where you can't see each other.<br/><br/>I always make sure when I run games that I give people breaks every hour, and after that I always try to ask how people are feeling, and what their energy level is.

If I have a new player, I do a sound check the day before, but I don't do anything in the lead-up to the session (I'm normally getting my kids to bed!)<br/><br/>Chit-chat is a little stilted on Skype, because of the turn-taking element.  I do, however, like to get a read on each player, though, a sort of informal check-in.  I want people to have a chance to say if they're exhausted because they have sleep apnea, got laid off that day (all real examples) or just have a headache, so that I have a head start on separating their reaction to the game and what they're bringing in from outside.<br/><br/>We do a session recap - normally that's me, since we tend to play a plot-dense game and it's useful to re-hydrate all of our memories.<br/><br/>Then I have the players read out their characters' beliefs/goals.  We have a shared spreadsheet, so it's nothing new, but I find having everyone read them out gets us into the right head space.  I then ask if they're still relevant of if they want to make any changes.<br/><br/>We're usually playing within about ten or fifteen minutes of the call starting.<br/><br/>At the end, I tend to ask people how they felt the session went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394837/#Comment_394837" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T16:45:01+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  4:45PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To bracket the play time, I like to open and close with songs. A different song for opening and closing, like a TV show. Choosing songs is something that I do during pre-campaign setup - I tend to put together a playlist anyway while I'm thinking about a game for a while, so this sort of flows from that.<br/><br/>I was using the song Happily Ever After by He Is We as my closing song for a fairy tale inspired fantasy adventure game for about 6 months when suddenly I started hearing it on the radio. I totally felt like a TV show music director, discovering new talent. (I was using an older, less over-produced version that I still like better than the version I hear on the radio.)<br/><br/>If any of you wants to do this for an Apocalypse World game, I humbly submit the following suggestion - The End Of The World by The Repair. It's an all girl acapella group, the rhythm is one of the girls beatboxing. I love this song to death.<br/><br/><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="385" mozallowfullscreen="" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/3331804" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"></iframe> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
