It was JP's idea to use Outdoorsman, and we worked out the details of it together.<br/><br/>When I have a bit of time maybe I'll write that post I've been meaning to do about how I think Gumshoe works much better when investigative spends are treated like Aspects or Stunts in Fate.</blockquote>\nPlease do -- folks get skeptical when I mention this, and as I don't understand it especially well, I suck at explaining it.<br/><br/>At the moment, I'm running Trail, it seems to be working, and... I'm still not quite sure why it works.</blockquote>\nOkay, I will try to oblige! My thinking on this stuff isn't totally systematic yet, so bear with me...<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but when I first read Trail of Cthulhu, my mind immediately snapped to the idea of spends (general and investigative) as both the obvious "spotlight economy" but also as a kind of <i>narrative</i> economy. Or as I like to answer the infamous "How come I'm a worse pilot when I spend all my points in Pilot?":\n<blockquote><br/>You're not. What that means is that <i>Pilot isn't going to be the way you'll get out of this scene</i>. Maybe it's the turn of the guy with Mechanical Repair to soup up the engines so you can pull away. Maybe it's the turn of the gal with Firearms to shoot down your intruders.<br/><br/>Or maybe it's the turn of the kid with high Scuffling to, uh, lighten the plane's payload. With extreme prejudice.<br/><br/>Or maybe it means you crash! Hey, these are thriller/horror games...sooner or later you're going to crash on <i>something</i>.</blockquote>\n<br/>But I think I had another understanding churning away there, especially after reading about how you could get extra benefits from Investigative spends. And that understanding was...that spends were a currency of awesome; a way to let the player have some narrative control, to insert moments of Cool into the game. And that's the echt understanding of them! But I think I took it a bit farther.<br/><br/>Because, of course, if you are talking about an Economy of Awesome, you start sounding like you're talking about Fate. And Investigative skills resemble Aspects, after all; like an Aspect, they're <i>always true</i>. Somebody with Reassurance is always reassuring, just sometimes more than others.<br/><br/>So, in my own game, I've allowed stuff like...<br/><br/>...a Biology buy to make a werewolf think you were a member of her pack<br/>...a Physics buy to allow perfect timing of an explosive detonation<br/>...an Outdoorsman buy to let you refresh your Scuffling<br/><br/>This isn't exactly radical; Night's Black Agents clearly moves in this direction, although more by creating pools of general points--which makes sense, as NBA is going to burn a lot more General abilities than Trail of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>But...I dunno. What I'm doing feels a little qualitatively different. I'm in favor of letting the Investigative abilities be more than...investigation-related skills. To let them be like Declares in Fate; a way to assert something in the fiction that your character can do, or make happen.<br/><br/>Moreover, I'm of the opinion that if you <i>don't</i> do something like that, GUMSHOE doesn't work nearly as well. Because, well...GUMSHOE is really a diceless system at heart; the General abilities aren't usually what makes a PC unique--it's the Investigative skills that allow her to manipulate the world. And given how much more expensive Investigative skills are, they should be allowed to make an impact on the world in ways that go beyond clue discovery.<br/><br/>Put another way, I'd like to see a purpose for high levels of many different skills; I'm playing a PC now with five points in Oral History. Maybe it's just my own cockeyed interpretation, but I'd like that to reflect--at least for her--the ability to have a friend in lots of places, to have an ear to the ground for the places you can run and hide, or the best restaurant for a buck, or things like that. Always in conjunction with the the other abilities--my first example is constrained by Streetwise, the second by Credit Rating--but definitely used in ways that are creative and go beyond a simple discovery mechanic.<br/><br/>I don't know if that clarified anything, so if folks have questions or criticisms I'm looking forward to talking more about this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429959/#Comment_429959" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T12:17:28+00:00" title="March 25, 2014 12:17PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2014 12:18PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, General Abilities already work like standard "gain a +2" Invokes, to a degree.

As I understand GUMSHOE (from reading Mutant City Blues, Fear Itself, and Night's Black Agents), Investigative spends work like this...<br/><br/>The GM has clues. The GM gives you clues. If you want to get more out of a clue, you can spend. This generally means that the GM reveals more information. Usually, it just seems to be color.<br/><br/>(It could also be that because Trail is bad at explaining them, you've assumed that they're something much more awesome than Robin intended. Which is totally cool in my book. :-) )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430010/#Comment_430010" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T08:04:38+00:00" title="March 26, 2014  8:04AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ToC does specifically say you can use spends to gain benefits unrelated to clues. <br/>I'll see if I can dig up the wording. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430012/#Comment_430012" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T08:29:06+00:00" title="March 26, 2014  8:29AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, OK - here we go. <br/>On page 53 there's a bunch of example benefits - many of which are unrelated to clues. <br/>The very first is "The benefit gives you an advantage in a future contest of General abilities." (It doesn't specify whether this is, say, a reduced Difficulty, a refreshed pool or what.)<br/>It then lists things like discovering your car is out of petrol before you need to drive it, "Credit Rating might get you access to an NPC psychoanalyst or doctor". <br/>These certainly <i>could</i> be linked to some element of the ongoing mystery, but it's hard to see a lot of clues where the extra info is "you're out of gas". What happened? You dusted for prints to find out who stole and then abandoned your car, and you clocked the fuel gauge while you were peering at the steering wheel?<br/><br/>Other non-clue related examples the book offers include "gives a favorable impression to supporting characters", "get[s] you some dedicated pool points", or "allow[s] you to create a notable work". <br/><br/>All these, I think, fit in with the examples Aviatrix gives above. <br/><br/>But the section "Spends and Benefits" (page 54) begins "Certain clues allow you to gain special benefits by spending points from the relevant investigative ability pool" and never quite says that you can spend points on something that isn't a clue, though it brings up the empty fuel tank example again. <br/><br/>But (but!) then the in-depth example of a spend that follows this is a player asking "Is there another way into the house?" <br/>Pretty much the only way I can see that being related to a capital-C Clue is if the very existence of the house is a clue. <br/><br/>Reading these pages now, it occurs to me that some of the weirdness in ToC goes away if when you see the word "clue", you read "established fact in the story". <br/>You can spend points on things we know are true - there's a weird chemical in that flask; your PC is a great outdoorsman; you're talking to a pack of werewolves. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430014/#Comment_430014" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T08:50:35+00:00" title="March 26, 2014  8:50AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I'd thought:<br/><br/>Just having the investigative ability gets you the clue that is necessary to Find the Plot and reach a satisfying climax.<br/><br/>Spending gets you extra clues that might help your investigators survive or succeed in thwarting the ritual or whatever.<br/><br/>I've also been told that Spends are ways of getting extra limelight.
