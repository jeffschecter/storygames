Each player controls a Division - Life Sciences, Command, Engineering, etc - and although decisions are made cooperatively, each Division has its own goals/duties.<br/><br/>Control of these Divisions will change hands throughout the game, to reflect the reality that future generations may or may not follow through with the player's plans in the centuries-long journey to their destination. <br/><br/>Each round, an Event Card is presented that offers opportunities (with or without cost) to the players; it may be something benign (like coming across a derelict ship) or much more dangerous (space fungus has crippled your food supply). Each cad will present a scenario that hurts, or possibly helps one or more Division on the ship.<br/><br/>Players accrue points for themselves when acting on behalf of their Division, and the ship gains points (needed at the end of the game) when a consensus decision is reached - the root of which must be fictional. <b>this is the part I'm struggling with.</b><br/><br/>As the game progresses, available resources will become more depleted, and as such choices become more difficult to agree on. The player with the highest score is allowed to keep control over her division during a generational switch (called a "cycle"). <br/><br/>That's the crux of it. I'd the game to be both narrative-focused like The Quiet Year, or Kingdom, but also cooperative and goal-oriented, without having a GM. Is this possible?<br/><br/>In TQY, I often ran into two issues (depending on who I played with): one, there wasn't an actual "goal", and two, players were required to create their own dilemmas. This didn't always fair well with my more... crunchy gamer friends. I'm wondering if it is possible to have a cooperative game that has a clear goal, but also allows for a narrative result?<br/><br/>I've got the narrative setup (mostly) done; the mechanics, gameplay and win/lose conditions, but I feel like I'm digging myself into a hole - every new cooperative play mechanic makes the game harder and hard to add a RPG/story/narrative to - almost like it is at odds with itself!<br/><br/>For instance, each round, the players must draw a card. It may have one or more possibilities on it; usually with a cost. The players must then discuss how to proceed. Great! <br/>However, if I add a narrative spin (e.g. the card says, "Choose how you resolved this problem, and get X goodie") I hit a dead-end. Who decides whether the players succeed, and how well they do? If I have the outcomes predetermined (on the card) then that takes away player's sense of control over the story, and it becomes simply a cooperative game.<br/><br/>I've considered adding dice to the equation, like: roll 2d6, if you get 10+ you succeed in your attempt! On a 7-9 (or whatever) you succeed, but partially fail (describe how). But without a GM to I feel like that sort of craps on the players efforts - or at worst, that the players will always go easy on themselves. <br/><br/>Alternatively, I'd be OK scrapping the decision-making fictional resolution thing, and adding a separate story element elsewhere. My gut tells me that the more rules I add into the game, the less likely it will have story elements in it (something I really want!). <br/><br/>That's all - thanks for getting this far. I'd appreciate any insight you all may have; don't be afraid to crap all over it!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462523/#Comment_462523" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T13:37:54+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  1:37PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider something like Engle Matrix Games: players have to evaluate the chosen course of action on a number of parameters to assess how likely it is to succeed, this evaluation process yielding a target number to roll against (or a percentage to roll under, or whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462526/#Comment_462526" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T13:55:30+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  1:55PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it an issue that the setting forces a collectivist, "all in the same boat" (no pun intended) mentality? Unless the ship can still function while an entire division goes to heck, players are basically forced to compromise on their own division goals for the sake of the greater good, which suppresses the kind of conflict that often seems to drive narrative games... right?<br/><br/>If you take it as understood from the beginning that the ship won't (or is highly unlikely to) succeed on its journey--for example, because of inevitable infighting among the different divisions and people refusing to submit their own egos to the greater good of the collective--it could create much more drama as cracks inevitably form and people struggle with the uncertainty of the mission's success; take failure as a given, and the struggle (and story) comes in the form of figuring out how to fail and deal with the consequences. Most of the cards would have to have negative outcomes that are very hard to avoid, at least in their entirety. This sort of thing may be counter to what you actually want to do with the game, though...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462528/#Comment_462528" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T14:09:55+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  2:09PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do I understand correctly that the root of your problem is this scenario:<br/><br/><i>We are playing the game. A fictional situation has been developed with the aid of the rules mechanics. Discussion of how to resolve the situation ensues. However, the outcome of the situation will have strong influence over mechanical privileges of the players, and for this reason the players are encouraged to ignore fictional style, causality, prior fact and other constraints to force the outcome they desire. Ultimately the narrative element becomes a meaningless adjunct to the game, as it serves no purpose in relation to the boardgame.</i><br/><br/>If that's the difficulty you're having, there are no easy ways out of it. Roleplaying games generally avoid this problem by achieving a certain kind of "escape velocity" from the rules: the game includes various phases and practices of play that encourage the players to care about the fiction and build more fiction upon the fiction and "query" the fiction, until the fiction genuinely becomes more important emotionally than the ostensible rules mechanics. Once this "escape velocity" has been reached, the play process can flirt with mechanical subgames without crashing back to earth, as the creative agenda of the players has been oriented to consider respect for the fiction to be a primary concern over the mechanical consequences.<br/><br/>Perhaps playing <i>Once Upon a Time</i> with this issue in mind would prove illuminating. First play a round normally (everybody trying to win, that is), and then try to play one with the explicit agenda of setting the game in a serious setting and creating a legit story. It is possible to change OUaT from a hovercraft (a shallow linguistic card game) into a space rocket (a real rpg or story game or whatever) in this way, and it's easy to see how the attitude of the players, as reinforced by their mutual interaction, is what ultimately causes the game to gain fictional elevation.<br/><br/>And no, I certainly didn't post this just so I could use that spaceship metaphor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal" title="yochaigal"><img alt="yochaigal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/885/nLZYCQ6WJ20JO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal">yochaigal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462530/#Comment_462530" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T14:28:52+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  2:28PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu:<br/>Looking at the Engle Matrix system now.<br/><br/>yukamichi:<br/>Divisions have duties, and they gain points by fulfilling these duties. Often times those duties will come into conflict with other Divisions (e.g. fuel vs food; social anxiety vs happiness). That said, the game does force a consensus approach, simply because the players are meant to think that they are on a ship, with little option to leave.

I will think on this.  <br/><br/>Eero: <br/>Your understanding of my issue is perfect, as is your description of how RPGs typically avoid this problem.

We had a problem with the ewok population skyrocketing and threatening our operations in endor, as well as the usual rebel scum issues. On top of that there was civil unrest due to economical problems as the working conditions were usually so dangerous on the public eye that nobody wanted to work on the most crucial aspects of defense and police our society needed.<br/><br/>We ended solving one problem with the other: started to recruit and brainwash ewoks as storm troopers, open millions of working positions on the war industry needed to outfit their cheap mass-produced equipment and then throwing all these minions back at the rebels, utterly destroying them.<br/><br/>So, well, we had fun but not as the game intended at all, for kingdom to be truly fun as it is there must be conflict, disagreement, sacrifices. You need to remain true to the character convictions even against the light of reason, you need to remain distrustful and skeptical, otherwise pure nerd/munchkin fun may get the best of you and solve the conflict before it starts the actual fun.<br/><br/>On a couple other occasions we used something closer to a gmless cooperative system, the key was to give the players a single limitation that would put them on direct conflict. In both cases it was a mix of character priorities, the way they got things done or a non-negotiable condition they had to see fulfilled before submitting to other people's suggestions or plans.<br/><br/>It works wonders, specially if these are not known by other players before the discussion takes place. It makes negotiations hard and really interesting, as well as igniting future conflicts and events. All the group needs to agree here is that each one will roleplay inside these limits and that's it, conflict guaranteed, and it doesn't even need to escalate or get to violence, that was the most fun part.<br/><br/>For example, if you have limits like:<br/><br/>-I can agree or support anything, but my division must come first.<br/>-I'll say anything that need to be said, but that doesn't mean I will stick to it.<br/>-Peace needs to be upheld at any cost<br/>-Knowledge comes first<br/>-People comes first, except those that don't value people's life.<br/>-Efficiency is everything<br/>-I'll support anyone that gives me actual benefits<br/>-The mission comes first, sacrifices must be made.<br/>-I'll shoulder this but you better never forget what I did<br/><br/>and distribute these randomly among the players, even the smallest events may generate interesting discussions and subsequent events. Switch these limitations each generation and you are set!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal" title="yochaigal"><img alt="yochaigal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/885/nLZYCQ6WJ20JO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal">yochaigal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462537/#Comment_462537" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T17:40:06+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  5:40PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk:<br/><br/>This is fantastic.

E.g. a game of Archipelago would encourage a certain style of collaborative play, while a game of Paranoia would encourage  a specific competitive spirit.<br/><br/>The  second approach is to design a set of "hard rules" that work out by design. I.e. Microscope has very clear, strict nd empowering rules for scene authority/framing. I remember Durance also as  a collaborative game with tight rules.<br/><br/>For your game, could it work giving players the option to either choose <br/>a) character success or <br/>b) narrative player permission? <br/>(either your character gets what they want or you get to narrate the scenario). <br/>Maybe I am thinking in a completely different direction, though...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal" title="yochaigal"><img alt="yochaigal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/885/nLZYCQ6WJ20JO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal">yochaigal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462551/#Comment_462551" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T23:43:35+00:00" title="April 27, 2017 11:43PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BeePeeGee, can you provide examples as to what you mean?

So, in a traditional RPG, a GM usually decides in some way if characters succeed at what they (or their player) intend and describes the details of what happens in the imaginative world.<br/><br/>I'm suggestiing now a mechanic for GMless play: Whenever a situation arises that puts a player character's intentions in conflict with the creative agenda, the involved player has to choose<br/>a) they either push through what their character wants or<br/>b) they get to narrate the details of what happens in the fictional world<br/>- but they cannot have both.<br/>Example:<br/><i>- While playing as a group, you"ve already established that your world is marked by scarcity and lack of resources (i.e. no fuel, limited technology).<br/>- Now, a player draws a card or uses a mechanic and says "what the heck, I'm gonna build my division an airplane now".<br/>- Other players object that this is against established fiction and invoke the new "can't-have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too" mechanic.<br/>- The initial player now chooses to nevertheless use the card mechanic and their division/PC gets an airplane. Other players now narrate the details how this plays out in the fiction (i.e. the airplane is solar powered and can only fly with sunshine, the division has to make a pact with shady groups to get the parts for the airplane, the airplane is so rare that it draws unwanted attention...)<br/>-Alternatively, the initial player begrudgingly accepts that their division cannot get an airplane. Now, this player can at least narrate some other fictional details in their favor (i.e. their PC meets a caravan with horses that can provide them help with transportation...)<br/></i><br/><br/>Another way to play this out mechanically is to introduce a <i>token economy </i> for narrative permission: A player encountering fictional objection can invest additional plot points to get what they want or they accept the objection and receive a plot point in return. Hillfolk/Dramasystem for example uses such a mechanic.<br/><br/>A "soft rule" could also be to convince players from the beginning that telling a fun (possibly tragic) story together is much more fun than some characters "winning"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462599/#Comment_462599" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T17:13:51+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  5:13PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>WarriorMonk:<br/><br/>This is fantastic.
