Does anyone have any experiences or advice to share about fostering some family-friendly gaming? Presuming we get enough attendees, we should be able to designate one room "family-friendly" and designate one room open for all types of gaming. What else should we do?<br/><br/>Also, is anyone coming who's interested in running something for the younger set?<br/><br/>Go Play NW is a laid-back gaming convention to be held in Seattle June 23-24. You can find out more, help us plan, and register at the <a href="http://goplaynw.wetpaint.com" rel="nofollow">Go Play NW Web site</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63453/#Comment_63453" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-10T21:44:05+00:00" title="April 10, 2007  9:44PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would be happy to run such a game (as long as it's understood that it doesn't constitute a babysitting service where kids can be dropped off and forgotten.)  I've long been interested in introducing kids to RPGs; in fact, I have a <a href="http://www.tlucretius.net/RPGs/kids.html" rel="nofollow">Web page on the topic</a>.  Since my games of choice were all very simple systems, I could pick any of them.  I'm thinking Cat, Zorcerer of Zo, or InSpectres, open to all ages but giving preference to kids.  What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63529/#Comment_63529" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T11:27:01+00:00" title="April 11, 2007 11:27AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool page! Agreed on the babysitting. If anyone's bringing a minor with them, I'd think they need to be in the same gaming area as their child. I think I need to add that requirement to the Go Play Wiki (as soon as I get out of work h#ll).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
