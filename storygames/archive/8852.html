As we all know, d20 games tend to be quite combat driven, and I am worried my players will resent the loss of tactical combar for the sake of a new, more story friendly system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey all do play Vampire the requiem... But I am just sure Vampire gives more to combat... just because reganing health is so easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of making combat somewhat more crude and with a more dangerous feel to it... but I don't know how the players will react to this change. Any thoughts, or similar experiences?<br/>\n<br/>\n(The game has been on hold for some time now... but it'll get re-started in two more weks)<br/>\n<br/>\nExcuse the spelling and grammar. I'm not a native english speaker and I'm really sleepy right now, I shall correct this tomorrow (Granted the edition time isn't limited to a few hours, this is also my first post here)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks in advance for the comments and advice!</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style="color:orange">Important note: I'm not looking for suggestions as to what system to use just jet, I'll stick with WoD for a few sessions and see what happens then, if it doesn't work, I shall look for suggestions o what other systems I may use.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style="color:purple">Edit: Is it posible to have good tactical combat in nWod?

Just translating the characters into a new system is going to change what they can do and how well they do it, and that's before you even consider the very different ways those games handle combat.<br><br>But change doesn't have to be bad.  In fact, when you're talking about a game, the only time that change is always bad is when it's <i>unwelcome.</i>  So the only people, and I really mean the ONLY people whose opinions matter in this case are you and the other players.  Nothing anyone else has to say will be meaningful or helpful.<br><br>If you guys like how your game feels after the change, you're all set.  If you hate it, you'll need to change again, or just abandon that game and start a different one.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195826/#Comment_195826" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T07:49:24+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  7:49AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2009 9:03AM by Omar_Ramirez.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color:darkblue">Well, actually we all agreed on this change.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am still worried... specially since one of the players seems to not be pretty fond of story gaming and seems to enjoy more the combat and tactical part of it...

I think I can make combat either crude or tactical.
