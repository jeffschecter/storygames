There's not a direct link from Harm to XP in TSoY, and there should be at least a relation.<br/><br/>Maybe it should take Harm to buyoff Keys?  <br/><br/>I get that Story Guides can already just dish out Harm, like a Hard Move in AW, but why can't they say no with Bringing Down the Pain?  <br/><br/>What would they get from it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480760/#Comment_480760" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-26T00:22:34+00:00" title="February 26, 2019 12:22AM">February 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've treated Transcendence as a sort of Ability buyoff in the past.

There's obviously the tendency that characters who transcend outside of immediate conflict situations tend to do so in a more expansive and subtly influential way than those who transcend in the middle of an action sequence. Mostly it depends on the player, though.<br/><br/>What do you think of this simple idea: recovering from "aggravated Harm" requires dropping a level from an appropriate Ability on top of the usual expense. Harm is "aggravated" if some crunch says it is (e.g. a "Secret of Aggravated Magic" that allows a Three-Corner wizard to cast especially injurious Destruction magic), or you suffer a second hit to the same Harm slot. In the latter case you pump up the Harm normally, but the lower slot also becomes aggravated in the process.<br/><br/>The idea here is to make Harm more scary, and directly erosive of character identity by endangering the character's Abilities. Characters need to struggle against this erosion to maintain their Ability levels. Penalizing doubled up Harm slots with aggravation also makes extended conflicts much more serious; you probably won't be able to fight to the hilt and fill your whole Harm track without suffering quite a few aggravations on the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480767/#Comment_480767" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-26T14:10:45+00:00" title="February 26, 2019  2:10PM">February 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a pretty interesting concept.

Whatever you're comfortable with.<br/><br/>Taking level 1 Harm repeatedly would presumably cause your Harm slot 1 to become aggravated, but as long as you only continue taking level 1s, the other slots would be spared the aggravation even as they fill; it's only the slot where the attack actually falls that gets the extra penalty. Of course once your ball is full almost any hit you take will, on top of bumping up to a high-level Harm, also aggravate wherever the hit actually landed.<br/><br/>If the concept of aggravated Harm interests, I recommend my fancy book <i>World of Near</i> - I explore the idea some in there. The idea of Ability loss isn't there, but it seems fun and it's easy to add once you decide to introduce "aggravation" as a concept. As Nathan says, having characters lose their skills has a dramatic charm all its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480773/#Comment_480773" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-26T14:37:58+00:00" title="February 26, 2019  2:37PM">February 26</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2019 2:48PM by Paul_T.">edited February 26</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that makes sense.
