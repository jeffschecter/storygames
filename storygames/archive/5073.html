He mentions three examples:<br/><br/>- How Diplomacy turns into a tangled web of intrigues and backstabbing, although the rules hardly say anything about that<br/>- How he playtested a game where going into conflict meant your scene had to end, so nobody went into conflict<br/>- How in CoC, the sanity drain you get from learning the Cthulhu Mythos meant that people just started burning old tomes when they found them instead of reading them<br/><br/>These three things point to one common, basic rule:<br/><br/><b>People will do whatever they can to stay in the game.</b><br/><br/>You can play Diplomacy without the intrigue - but in a few turns, you'll be maneuvered out of the game completely. In the playtest game, you could go into conflict - and then not get to play for a full turn. In CoC, you could read books - and have your character go insane and become completely useless.<br/><br/>For game design, this means that if you put in some way that players can end up with nothing to do, you'll create emergent play where they <i>avoid</i> that. A fairly obvious insight, but an insight nonetheless.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114575/#Comment_114575" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T14:29:15+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  2:29PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2007 2:53PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for listening!  This is a good point, and it deserves unpacking.  And countering.<br/><br/>Let's talk about my Diplomacy game.  At the time of that recording, I was loving the shit out of that game.  It was around the next week or so when the game turned bad.  Not in that I was losing, but in that people were really bad about being late with orders (and the rules we played on allowed that), and eventually people stopped sending me press.  So, for two years I played a "quiet" game of Diplomacy, getting frustrated with people not responding to my press and being late with orders.  Then one turn I got some hate-press from a neighbor, and I just quit that game.  I was hanging in there not to be the jerk that quits, and because I thought I might want to play with these guys in a face-to-face game (as we're all in the area and one of the players knows everyone).  But, as my interest eroded every season and with that hate-press, I decided that I didn't care if these people wouldn't want me in their game again, because I felt the same way.  "Life is too short to keep playing bad games."  So I resigned.  (And, to be honest, I was actually doing kinda well at that point, as a 7-build Italy with the Iberian in my possession in 1910.)<br/><br/>So, what does that say about the premise?  That it should be amended:<br/><br/><b>People will do whatever they can to stay in the game, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">until</span> unless they gain sufficient motivation to out-right leave the game.</b>  Perhaps that's what buy-in, socially and in-game, counters.<br/><br/>Now, how does this relate back to game design (which was my point on my show...well, is <em>always</em> the point on my show)?  Does it?<br/><br/>Lenny Balsera and I will talk at length on this subject, and we've come up with two categories of Emergent Play:\n<ul><li>Weak, or Modelable, Emergent Play -- Emergent Play that can be predicted and can be used as a direct influence in game design.  The strongest and most-common that I have seen and used is to, instead of giving only one choice, give two choices but one is particularly undesirable.  The players, feeling like they have made a choice, are less likely to rebel against the game because them <em>could have</em> made that bad choice if they truly wanted.  (And, hey, sometimes they do -- that's okay, because that's a release valve, and the system/setting/whatever handles it rather than breaking.)</li><li>Strong, or Unmodelable, Emergent Play -- Emergent Play that cannot be predicted at the design time and cannot be used directly as an influence in game design (though, perhaps indirectly).  One common example is when one game is similar to another in theme, system, scope, etc., there is sometimes rules-bleed.  When we first played Dogs, one of us forgot, or didn't know to, narrate our Trait dice in.  He just rolled all his relevant Trait dice at the beginning of the conflict, like we might do in a more traditional game where we would narrate the after-effects of rolling, but not really narrate what dices we're putting into out hands (and saying "I'm using X, Y and Z traits" isn't narrating).  We started playing like that for our first few games, until someone who actually knew how to play right corrected us.  That's Emergent Play that can't be modeled.</li></ul>\nThose are just examples, and rather easy ones at that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114576/#Comment_114576" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-15T14:42:32+00:00" title="December 15, 2007  2:42PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think I agree with the altered premise.<br/><br/>Sometimes I encounter emergent play that I find hard to analyze - it's hard to isolate the reasons for it.

It's the group act of repeating that mistake and integrating it into how they play that game that makes it emergent play -- it becomes a mutation of that game based on the play of that group.  That's part of why it's not modelable, at least from my understanding.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the "weak" and "strong" terms come from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia page on the science of Emergence</a>.<br/><br/>I'm going to change my altered premise from "until" to "unless" -- "until" makes it sound inevitable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116247/#Comment_116247" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-24T23:55:00+00:00" title="December 24, 2007 11:55PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "until" is correct. No game lasts forever, really, and at some point everyone has enough motivation to leave it. I remember that, on <a href="http://masterplan.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=286128" rel="nofollow">Episode 20</a>, Luke Crane said most BW games ended when the group said "I cannot do this anymore". For most games, this is  emergent behaviour. There are no clear rules on how the game ends, but there is a definite end in actual play. Even on games that do have clear endings some emergent behaviors might end them prematurely.<br/><br/>Also, I wanted to say to you that Episode 18 has been my favorite so far, it really makes you ponder a lot of things.

In my group, we tend to play in short burst of 3-5 sessions and it's obviously influenced by the amount of campaigns we never finished and the ones that went on for several years. Has it ever happened to you that you reach the defined ending but you still want to keep playing? We played an invasion phase for BE and, after fending off the Vaylen everyone wanted to keep playings, since there were many unresolved issues, but it would have changed the nature of the game completely.<br/><br/>On the other hand, back when we played D&amp;D 3.0 we always stopped the game somewhere about level 12, because combat slowed down to a crawl, there were to many spells and items to keep track of and some of those seemed broken at the time. Our old Vampire games had a similar problem. At some points, characters became too powerful and the nature of the game had to change to something we were no longer comfortable with.<br/><br/>At some point, I think, you have enough motivation to quit the game. This can be positive, such as in a game in which you reach a satisfactory or conclusive ending, or negative, as in your own experience above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
