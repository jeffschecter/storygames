They like "just playing", or when there's a conflict just rolling some dice and the GM telling them what it means (at least this is how it was several years ago).</blockquote>\nAnd that got me to thinking, because not only have I run games for folks who like this style of play, but I also like it myself as a player.<br/><br/>For this thread, I'm gonna call that "primordial gaming". And by that, I don't just mean games where the players may not have an involved idea of the game's mechanics, but more specifically games that may have little to no written mechanics, or perhaps just a thin spine of mechanics with the GM and/or players expected to negotiate/create mechanics as needed during play.<br/><br/>What I've noticed is there isn't much written down anywhere about this sort of gaming, yet it does seem to be popular enough in the wild. Tracking down the game Vulpinoid mentioned a while back ( [The Saga of] Raven's Nest) showed me one classic example of this. Similarly, I've a number of second hand accounts of Prof. Barker ( the Tekumel guy) running games in this fashion for a very long time. I'm sure a number of other board members have participated in similar kinds of games themselves. Some of y'all might've even had fun with it!<br/><br/>I'd like to open up discussion about this sort of gaming, specifically talking about what actually goes on in this sort of gaming, what sorts of procedures/methods are supportive of it, and how to play like this successfully.<br/><br/>I'd also like to hear some ideas about how such play could could be described in text in a fashion that would make the style worthy of being put into a for-sale product. One of the things I've noticed is that this particular style seems to get glossed over in the historical record of game design, which seems a shame to me.<br/><br/>I suppose I'd better start some discussion, too.<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed about this style of play generally is that the GM is more like a party host in some regards, than a keeper of canon or mechanics keeper. By this I mean that while they are engaged in traditional GM duties, they're also in many ways responsible for enabling connections between the other players, and there is a lot of back and forth riffing on ideas thrown out by the players. In many ways, this seems core to what the GM does in these games, especially when the "adventure" or setting is being created on the fly, or based on just a core nernel of situation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278045/#Comment_278045" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T11:07:55+00:00" title="June 26, 2010 11:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This topic intrigues me. <br/><br/>Perusing the DitV Advice thread, I read the 'Fort Lemon' module and, in retrospect, this seems like all that would be needed to run (and sell) a <i>primordial game</i>: a coherent setting with some built-in conflicts that the whole group can immediately enter and start to interact with.

I tried to stick to the WoD rules when feasible, but at least half of the game was run "primordially." Two observations:<br><br>1) I'm convinced that I was able to get away with this as GM solely because I'm a professor and most of the players were students. When they asked me where I came up with a particular formula for die rolls, and I just shrugged and said "the GM is God," they never complained and rarely seemed to mind.<br><br>2) People who were in that campaign still come up to me and tell me that is was the best gaming experience they've ever had. Most of them still play RPGs, and most of the RPGs they play now are rules-intensive monstrosities like Pathfinder and D&amp;D 4e. I've been to some of these sessions, and usually at least 60% of the time is spent looking up obscure rules and deliberating agonizingly over simple combat moves. I do not understand this at all.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278144/#Comment_278144" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T11:20:15+00:00" title="June 27, 2010 11:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have only had bad experiences with this style of gaming.<br><br>It seems to me that it encourages player passivity and the abdication of player responsibility.  By this I mean that (again, at least in my experience) it encourages characters who sit around and wait for things to happen to them, and players who expect the GM to entertain them.  When I am a player, this frustrates me, because I want my characters to *do* things, not to have things done to them; and when I am a GM, I do not want to tell a story to the players, but to come up with a story together that is better (or at least more surprising to me) than anything I could have come up with myself.<br><br/>I also know a player who plays almost exclusively in that style; she pretty much caused a game of Jihad (the Burning Wheel setting) to crash and burn by saying, "Oh, I don't care, just tell me when to roll dice and I will."  She wanted to play a combat monster -- her concept was that her charater was a masterful warrior who had given up war -- but without her, as the player, investing some effort in learning the rudiments of how the combat system worked, her character was incompetent in combat, and she put most of the blame for that on me.  <br/><br/>(And I think there's a distinction here between "primordial gaming" and other freeform styles -- I think the qualitative difference is that in the primordial style, the GM is responsible for everyone's fun, and if a player is not sufficiently involved, it's the GM's fault.  One of the things I really really like about the culture of story games is that this attitude doesn't fly: each player has partial ownership of the game and total responsibility for his or her own fun.)                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278196/#Comment_278196" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T17:13:12+00:00" title="June 27, 2010  5:13PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cwilbur:<br/>Actually, I'm kinda hoping that this stuff I'm calling primordial gaming can be re-examined a bit through the lens of various story-game techniques. I suspect that sometimes, when players get successful primordial type gaming, it's because the GMs and players ingerently grab onto methods that we'd see more codified/made into set mechanics in story-games. But I also think that kind of instinctual method-building tends to be very spotty, too, which probably leads to the opposite situation where people end up having a very bad experience with primordial gaming.<br/><br/>FWIW, I also had a very frustrating time trying to play BW as a player, for what I suspect was the problem your player faced. I hope you'll stay in this discussion because of some of your unhappy experiences, actually, and you'll be able to point to ideas or methods that could be transferred over to primordial gaming from games you do know and like, especially story games.<br/><br/>lordgoon:<br/>Could you expand a bit on your two points? I'm especially curious about when you called for rolls especially regarding anything that you might have done which resembled either negotiated stakes or known/implied outcomes when you called for those die-rolls ( for example, did you ever give indications pre-roll about how much might be accomplished or lost prior to a die-throw? Was there any time when players could draw back a bit and modify their planning /preparations and so on if they weren't quite ready to risk a roll of the dice? stuff like that)<br/><br/>Do you have any general idea of how much or how little the people who really enjoyed that campaign did personal reading of texts for the game? My experience with OWoD as both a player and GM was that everyone seemed to read the non story-fiction stuff, vaguely understand the rules, and then kinda sorta use the rules. In any case, they seemed much more interested in playing characters in the setting than understanding the in&amp;outs of the mechanical part.<br/><br/>Paul88:<br/>Yes, trust seems to be a huge part of this style. What kinds of attitudes and actions on the parts of players and GMs do you think can help establish and maintain that trust?<br/><br/>For example, in my eyes, one area of trust is that the GM will work to keep players involved in the game at some sort of level, for as long as the players are interested, and won't intentionally side-line a player. If for some reason a player does get sidelined, the Gm is there to get them back into participation as rapidly as possible. And by sidelining, I'm generally thinking of avoiding pemanent character death ( unless the player had some real say in that, possibly choosing to risk it themselves), but also other kinds of sidelining such as character ineffectualness or the major course of events kinda leaing a character out of interesting action for whatever reason.<br/><br/>Any general thoughts on that or other areas where trust needs to be established and maintained?<br/><br/>As for getting ribbed, well, like I said, lots of folks seem to do this stuff successfully in one form or another. It just seems to me like documentation of that is lacking more than anything else. I can only surmise that the folks doing it successfully are too busy having fun to bother writing it down. ( FWIW, I'e heard tell that Dave Arneson was imfamous for not documenting much of anything, pretty much playing those early games of his with notes scribbled on pretty much any handy slip of paper as needed. An aspect of Gary Gygax's contribution to creating this hobby was to take that stuff and actually put it into a format that could be distributed!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278202/#Comment_278202" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T17:50:45+00:00" title="June 27, 2010  5:50PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2010 7:03PM by lordgoon.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two sorts of circumstances in which I tended to lapse into primordiality (and I love this idea, by the way) were, first of all, when the players were investigating something and not picking up on the (mostly pretty subtle) clues that I was giving them. At a certain point I'd have them make a perception check with some totally <i>ad hoc</i> modifier added, and if they got what seemed to be like a sufficient amount of successes at the time, I'd start my next sentence with "It suddenly occurs to you that..."<br/><br/>Second of all, in combat when you're facing some of the creepy crawlies that populate the WOD, it's pretty hard for the GM to figure out on the fly how earnestly they'll pursue PCs when wounded, how they'll respond to various attempts to intimidate, what it takes to distract them, and so forth. On these occasions I'd make up stuff more or less totally on the fly.<br/><br/>What I actually love about the nWOD books - and I'm thinking mainly of the straight, multi-genre supplements rather than the additions to <i>Requiem</i>, <i>Mage</i>, <i>Exalted</i>, etc., which can sometimes get rather fiddly - is that they're written so that they can be read profitably either as additions to the core rules or just vague suggestions of spookily possible ways that the world you're playing in <i>might</i> be.Many of my players actually read the game texts much more lovingly and attentively than I did, but it's a system that discourages rules-lawyering, and I was able to use my outside-of-game status as an authority figure to discourage this even further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278209/#Comment_278209" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T18:54:12+00:00" title="June 27, 2010  6:54PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob, have you checked out some of the stuff that Vincent said on his blog a while ago about system vs. rules? <br/><br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=23" rel="nofollow">Check it out</a><br/><br/>I think it's pretty essential to understanding freeform play to recognise that they have systems just as much as any other kind of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278213/#Comment_278213" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T19:30:27+00:00" title="June 27, 2010  7:30PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I think it's pretty essential to understanding freeform play to recognise that they have systems just as much as any other kind of play.</blockquote>\nYup; that's why I started this thread- to suss out the ones that commonly produce good experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278258/#Comment_278258" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T08:10:00+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  8:10AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>For example, in my eyes, one area of trust is that the GM will work to keep players involved in the game at some sort of level, for as long as the players are interested, and won't intentionally side-line a player.</blockquote>\nis very problematic for me.  In the distant past, I played in a GURPS fantasy game where one of the players created a character with absolutely nothing in common with the other characters and actively resisted all attempts at getting her involved in some common affairs, to the point where the GM was running two games simultaneously set in the same world: one involved this particular player, and the other involved everyone else at the table.  So before I accept a statement like "The GM will work to keep players involved," I have to ask: how much of that is really *player* responsibility?  The example I describe led to the death of the ongoing game, because the GM got tired of running two games, the player countered with, "I'm just playing my character!" and that was that. <br/><br/>Before we get much further, though, I think we need to hammer out what the difference is between primordial games and freeform games.  To take a stab at it, it sounds to me like the main distinction is that in primordial gaming, there is a formal system of rules that the GM knows and the players likely do not.  The players say what they do, the GM translates this into rules, and tells the players what dice they need to roll to resolve the action.  In freeform gaming, there is a formal system of rules that everyone at the table knows and uses.  <br/><br/>The notions I'd introduce to primordial gamers:  You are responsible for your own fun; the GM can enable it, but can't make fun for you.  You are there as much to entertain the other players (including the GM) as to be entertained.  The more you invest in the game, the more you are likely to get out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278268/#Comment_278268" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T08:33:45+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  8:33AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your choice of notion to introduce.<br/><br/>As for suggested distinction...hmm, not sure about that difference exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278297/#Comment_278297" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T10:18:25+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 10:18AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2010 10:22AM by Potemkin.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I return to defend primordial gaming from it's detractors. It struck me only a moment ago that nearly every game of <i>Paranoia</i> I've ever played has been primordial - as a GM I refuse to conform to few (if any) of the rules as written. I allow the players to role their own dice (because everyone likes that) then interpret the result for maximum immediate entertainment <i>and</i> potential future entertainment (the introducing of new elements to the situation, for example). As anyone else found this?<br/><br/>I'll concede that, were I not even-handed or had a very different notion of fun than that of my players, the whole game would fall apart. I think primordialism requires a great deal of awareness as to social undertones and a readiness and capability as a GM to negotiate and reason with players to forward the narrative. That said, I think that primordial play requires the players to be ambitious in their fun-seeking; characters (like all good protagonists) have to be pro-active and ready to leap on subtle hints and nudges from a <i>more</i> passive GM-figure <i>and</i> other players. <br/><br/>I've been chewing through Keith Johnstones' <i>Impro for Storytellers</i> - I think a lot can be learnt from improvisational theatre and applied to storygames of all kinds, but its relevance has particular potency here. Johnstones talks about Referee figures in Impro-shows, giving out situations, guiding scenes away from the overly farcical or predictable and "honking" boring actors off-stage. Things are at their best (just like in all sports) when the Referee has no need to interfere. The point is, in primordial play the GM should be more like the Impro-Ref - A guide who holds the reigns of the game but loosely with nearly all <i>play-agency</i> attributed to the players; the GM only stepping in where necessary to guide the creation of new scenes, arbitrate player-conflict (not necessarily character-conflict) and keep the action tight and meaningful. "NPCs" should always be played by players, perhaps with a little more guidance.<br/><br/>I'd like to see a <i>Primordial Primer</i>. Ideally the introductory part of the book would be "GM" advice followed by a larger section to give players the tools and expectations to be 'pro-active' in play. There's more to be learnt from Impro: character motivations, scene motivations, timing, flow, agreement etc. The book really should be about equipping players with that agency that's essential to play. As for the rest? Well, I'd dearly love some tight scenarios focused on character interaction but also some short "one-shot" scenes that can be played as warm-ups or as cut-aways in a longer session. (I was recently playing Dark Heresy and the GM "cut-away" to a short, primordial dream sequence with an entirely different tone and focus - very refreshing.)<br/><br/><sub><i>Edited for Grammar.</i></sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278311/#Comment_278311" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T11:02:38+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 11:02AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So....<br/><br/>I think we may want to look at something like Montsegure.  What does that game give you?  A fixed situation with a semi-randomized distribution and choice of "focus" characters.  A known end point.  A method of introducing twists from outside the situation.  And an dispute adjudication system (someone is in charge at all times).<br/><br/>I think a Primordial game might open this up structure up a bit and generalize it.  Rather than providing a fixed situation it gives you tools for *generating* that situation.  A step in that direction would be something like Fiasco (which at viewed somewhat cynically is a Montsegure hack).<br/><br/>I think the bigger question is: Is the SYSTEM intended to evolve with play as well?  Because Montsegure's rules are rather rigged and clear (and excellent in my opinion).<br/><br/>Otherwise we might want to look at something like the Pool with the Monologue of Victory removed.  Because there is the basic "just play".  In a conflict roll dice if you get a 1 you get want you want otherwise, no.  But again, no System evolution.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how one *DESIGNS* an evolving system that doesn't also create a destabilized social situation that someone has to take responsibility for managing.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278369/#Comment_278369" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T14:12:53+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  2:12PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think systems (as a combination of rules-as-written and pragmatic choices made by the play-group) can't be designed, only directed. Sometimes the direction is very strong (crunchy, rules-heavy games) and sometimes very subtle, but a system definately has more to it than <i>just</i> the text of the book. <br/><br/>In my mind evolution in this fashion cannot be designed - it's organic. The play-group makes choices, comes to understandings and, either explicitly or implicitly, develops 'house rules.' Evolution has to be unique to each group; this might be irresponsible as a designer but otherwise the beauty of primordial play is ruined. <br/><br/>I think there has to be very little <i>technology</i> involved - the dice is there to prompt the GM (a good role, good things happen; a bad role, bad things) and always offer the player a chance of a great victory or loss. A GM, a dice (a d20 is only 'better' than a d6 in that it offers a greater range of outcomes; middling-fair etc) and a very simple system of modifiers are all that are needed for the mechanical side of SYSTEM. Everything else is elementary... primordial. <br/><br/>Archipelago II is a system that's core has a certain sense of the primordial to it - "Yes, if; No, but; No, and.." (etc,) cards taking the place of the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278443/#Comment_278443" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T23:02:51+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 11:02PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2010 11:08PM by Simon_C.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a design that facilitated this style of play would look a little like the principles for Apocalypse World.

First, there is an implicit clause in this style of gaming that the GM can change and/or invent, throw away rules at any time, without telling the players about it. From that perspective, even if you start out by showing the players a set of rules, as soon as you start playing, the players no longer know if they are being followed or not--therefore, they are "hidden". Second, for most people I've seen advocate this style of play, this is considered a feature: the idea that rules knowledge or consideration is NOT taking place is supposed to enhance the players' sense of immersion.<br/><br/>Does this jive with what you're calling "primordial gaming", or not?<br/><br/>2. As for discussing how to make this sort of gaming successful, isn't that what and how people have been discussing RPGs online (and offline) since the 1970's? What do you see lacking from those discussions that you wish were addressed? Or do you just feel that discussion of that playstyle is missing <i>here</i>, at Story Games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278500/#Comment_278500" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T08:46:18+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  8:46AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we need to hammer down a definition of primordial gaming really soon, because it looks to me like there are at least four ideas as to what "primordial gaming" is.

A primordial system can't be designed, but the writer has to equip the play-group with the skills and expectations necessary to structure and advance their own game-play. Gamers need to be design-savvy and know what they want from their game (in addition to being proactive narratively). <br/><br/>However, an element of chance (dice, cards, sortition) is still important because it imposes restriction on both the players and the GM, and restrictions breed creativity. Having a dice-roll (say) to interpret, forces the play-group out of a predicted response to a situation or its outcome. A weak character succeeds despite the odds - the tone of play and the <i>potentia</i> for new scenes is radically and unexpectedly altered. This 'spine' adds a new dimension to what is effectively more free-form play. This, and some parameters for characters (if only that they must be infitting with the setting) are the only "mechanical" elements I'd consider necessary to primordial play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278596/#Comment_278596" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T15:20:56+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  3:20PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>However I also don't see why I would choose Master of Illusion over some of the more evolved games and techniques available to us now, if for no other reason than to make the GM's job much easier and much more fun.</blockquote>\nYeah, my thoughts exactly. This kind of play is exhausting to GM. Probably having a set of formal guidelines like "Master of Illusion" would make things easier, but there's still enormous onus on the GM to provide an entertaining experience by selecting the right options, and also introducing compelling fictional material at the right pace. <br/><br/>Probably you could further mitigate this effect by giving the GM templates for mysteries and the actions of enemies, a bit like "Fronts" from Apocalypse World, so that they're doing less inventing and more choosing from a list. That would help.<br/><br/>You could also give players more illusion of agency by introducing a mechanic for them to roll extra dice (and take the highest) when thei character has relevant equipment or skills or whatever. One thing I like about this is how it nicely reveals that things on character sheets are about giving the players (or in this case the GM) more options for saying things in play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I don't think there needs to be any hiding of system from the players. In Simon's game for example, I see no particular reason that you couldn't essentially show the whole thing to the players (although as mentioned, I might modify the language a bit to put a positive spin on a couple of points).</blockquote>\nYeah, the choice of whether the players know the GM is using this system, or whether you misdirect by claiming to be using some kind of task resolution system determines if you're playing illusionistic play or functional participationism. Neither of those styles are my cup of tea, but the second at least has the advantage that you're not lying to your friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278606/#Comment_278606" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T15:57:05+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  3:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I don't really feel a consistent GM encompassing a variety of game duties is necessary for primordial play.

And that really IS "primordial gaming", even down to the "doesn't necessarily need a GM" spec.<br/><br/>What we're really looking at here is essentially "how do we do conflictless gaming"? The play experience that is usually being pursued here is one where the player's expectations of what would happen are never meaningfully betrayed by the identifiable action of another person. It's wish-fulfillment.<br/><br/>When it works, it feels FABULOUS. It never really works for very long, though. The sustainable versions of it tend to run either on heaping doses of GM sleight-of-hand or on the deliberate flight from conflict into play that is characterized by a lot of character posing and individual scenes that are all exposition and no conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278726/#Comment_278726" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T07:28:30+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  7:28AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark:<br/><br/>I think you're right to a very real extent about some of this being wish-fulfillment.

They want to go on a thrill ride, secure in the knowledge that it's all a pageant for their entertainment. The character may appear to genuinely be in trouble, but everybody knows that no lines will ever be crossed, and everything will come out right in the end.<br/><br/>Think about TV. Not the kind of long-form TV that's seen so much of a renaissance lately, with arcs and dramatic character changes. The kind of episodic stuff that runs forever in syndication, where the quirky band of buddies gets into a new variation of the same formulaic scrape week after week, solves it by employment of a new variation on their trademark talent or character quirks, and the credits roll with them departing into the sunset to arrive next week at a new plot.<br/><br/>Virtually every American genre TV show until around 1995 ran on this model.

Easy to cope with new/departing players/characters. No complicated backstory or ongoing arc to to slot them into.<br/>2. GM planning is simplified by the formulaic structure and expectations.<br/>3. Player system mastery is not particularly necessary, but genre savvy, "canon" knowledge, and other more generally FUN skills are helpful without being overpowering.<br/>4. Secure in the protection of formula, players take more "risks" with their characters.<br/>5. Because characters (as they relate to the plot) are largely defined in terms of their skill set, archetype/tropes, and a few colorful quirks, you get some nice effects<br/>      -- easy to model in many game systems<br/>      -- as long as spotlight is well-managed, character development is largely a matter of coloring in the established outline, which means it is both optional and non-destructive<br/>      -- as long as players stay within the bounds of the formula, they have a LOT of freedom over character's internal states and behavior. All the plot-relevant stuff is system, all the <br/>         character-relevant stuff is not.<br/><br/>Note that last one! I think that's where a lot of the emotional juice for some players is: they can let the "game" part play out pretty much on autopilot, while all their creative juices go into various forms of scenery-chewing, clever quips, and social-level goofing. The system doesn't care about the internal states of the character in any way, and the consequences of system-mediated success or failure are always just complication and new content en route to the eventual end credits. You get lots of fan-service, opportunity to show off your cleverness and Real Roleplayer skills, and a satisfying conclusion. All this without the danger of .... no, NOT failure ... unwanted events. Everything that happens happens for your entertainment.<br/><br/>Vigorous Creative Agreement.

They believe that if everyone ACKNOWLEDGES that the dangers are all smoke and mirrors that the illusion will some how be broken.  As a result the systems involved can still produce many unwanted and unsafe events and outcomes.  The GM must step in and compensate in order to keep the game on formula track and be keenly sensitive to each player's individual emotional safety.<br/><br/>Also, I really like the language of "unwanted events" because I think "failure" is a red-herring.  There is a lot of character posturing focused play that is based on being tragic.  These characters fail and get hurt all the time but still stay well within a prescribed socially safe formula.  (Trying not to bring up Houses of the Blooded.... aw, damn).<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278844/#Comment_278844" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T14:47:36+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  2:47PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm. Sorry, I'll re-phrase my comment: "But it's not exclusive to primordial play." Episodic, party-based, danger-of-the-session style play is a <i>style</i> that is common (arguably) feature, but isn't a defining point of what we're discussing here. <br/><br/>I would say that all GMs (and, to an extent, most socially-aware players) will strive to keep the game formula on track and to stay clear of "unwanted events" - what has this to do, specifically, with primordial gaming? It's applicable across the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278847/#Comment_278847" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T14:59:12+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  2:59PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think most of us are referring to something Vincent said on his blog.  I'll quote it here:<br/><br/>"As far as I\u2019m concerned, the purpose of an rpg\u2019s rules is to create the unwelcome and the unwanted in the game\u2019s fiction. The reason to play by rules is because you want the unwelcome and the unwanted \u2013 you want things that no vigorous creative agreement would ever create. And it\u2019s not that you want one person\u2019s wanted, welcome vision to win out over another\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s weak sauce. No, what you want are outcomes that upset every single person at the table. You want things that if you hadn\u2019t agreed to abide by the rules\u2019 results, you would reject.<br/><br/>"The challenge facing rpg designers is to create outcomes that every single person at the table would reject, yet are compelling enough that nobody actually does so."<br/><br/>A lot of "indie" games from The Forge school are designed to constantly pull the rug out from under your expectations of how the game "should" go.  Whether a scene is a climax or simply the end of a chapter can turn a die roll.  YOUR character's story may shift from comedy to tragedy based solely on the input of another player and so on.  They are the social equivalents of sky-diving.  Not a particularly safe thing to do unless you have the proper equipment and work with people willing to take the risk with you.<br/><br/>Primordial Gaming is based (I believe anyway) a lot on the GM reading the emotional state of the players and pushing things in the safest direction possible.  Where-as a lot of indie games tell you explicitly that the GM is NOT there for your social comfort (Burning Empires probably being the most extreme example of such text).  Understand that I'm literally talking about the players real world emotions and not the content of the fiction.  There may be all kinds of death, dismemberment, tragedy, what have you in the resulting fiction but as long as it all conforms to players expectations and (often) pre-play assumptions then it's fine.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Thinking more about "Primordial

Players have less of an impetus to "game the system" if the mechanisms are more transparent. In such cases the randomiser and the mechanisms involved actually take on more of a facilitating role rather than an obstacle role. <br/><br/>That's just my 2 cents for the moment...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278861/#Comment_278861" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T16:44:42+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  4:44PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2010 4:51PM by misuba.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I think most of us are referring to something Vincent said on his blog.

Sometimes that means the dice have a solely ritual purpose, sometimes more gamey bits actually hold, but either way, their thinking about the dice is organized in terms of player experience, not the fiction at all (also not in terms of a game, really - not a game with real consistency in and of itself).<br/><br/>Player experience.

I've had to be very overly transparent about my intentions with the 4E group I DM, because I've seen that some of my players really need it.<br/><br/>Mind you, I don't think "Primordial" quite equates to "Old School" in this discussion.  From what I've observed first-hand in a couple of recent games, Old School GMing requires a certain neutrality on the GM's part.  There's also no guarantee of character safety, nor any guarantee that the fiction will be interesting or even in-genre!<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279024/#Comment_279024" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T22:27:39+00:00" title="July  1, 2010 10:27PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>No, I've seen this kind of techniques used for that, too.

If I break out your points:<br/><br/>1) Tailoring of outcomes<br/>2) Loose application of freely altered and non-transparent rules<br/>3) Active advocacy of a particular vision<br/><br/>What kinds of things can we do with those, given our experience with more story-gamey methods/techniques/mechanics?<br/><br/>1 &amp; 3 strike me as being pretty normative around these parts. What about <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>? That one seems the toughie.<br/><br/>On a side note, I find your comparison of Old School vs. P-Gaming interesting too because it makes me think about generational adoption of RPGs. OS, in a way, seems like the way people who had some background in wargames back in ye olden tymes would approach RPGs, while P-Gaming seems more like the approach of people for whom PGs were first encountered as a thing unto themselves. I certainly associate the P-gaming more with folks who began either during the D&amp;D Fad of the early 80s or the VtM Fad of the early 90s ( Of course, I was in both groups in a sense so undoubtedly that is coloring all of my thinking on this)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279065/#Comment_279065" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T07:38:23+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  7:38AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno.

My early D&amp;D (79-forward, Holmes) was definitely in the Primordial style.<br/><br/>FWIW, the wargamers in the games club definitely were more likely to disdain Primordial elements and strive for rules-driven, neutral-referee play. That fracture was pretty clear in our circles as early as 81. Of course, the main club I was associated with, the old-school tendency guys mostly abandoned D&amp;D for The Fantasy Trip, Traveller, and (later) Rolemaster.

P-gaming is all over out there, but it is the "gaming that dare not speak its name" on the internet. Largely because the techniques that make it go are intensely localized and dependent on a social infrastructure that's not all that common. Successful P-gaming groups are insular, long-running, and idiosyncratic. They have little to talk to others about, since their games are run with tacit and mystified systems and in pursuit of highly particular visions.<br/><br/>People who know a lot about P-gaming:<br/><br/>1. Online rp-ers<br/>2. SOME diceless rp-ers - the Amber DRPG used to be fertile ground for it, but it's increasingly a hardcore-only canon-argument club.<br/>3. CoC players and other highly genre-driven play communities<br/>4. "Pulp" and superhero gamers of SOME varieties<br/>5. Some immersion-serving GMs probably know a lot, but I think relatively few immersion-centric players know what it is that makes it work (only what makes it fail)<br/><br/>I think the association of P-gaming with munchkin/killer GM is like a lot of gamer identity politics: driven not by the style as successful play, but by the common (and often spectacular) failure modes of the style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279127/#Comment_279127" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T12:18:32+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 12:18PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2010 12:21PM by komradebob.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Primordial Gaming is based (I believe anyway) a lot on the GM reading the emotional state of the players and pushing things in the safest direction possible. Where-as a lot of indie games tell you explicitly that the GM is NOT there for your social comfort (Burning Empires probably being the most extreme example of such text). Understand that I'm literally talking about the players real world emotions and not the content of the fiction. <b>There may be all kinds of death, dismemberment, tragedy, what have you in the resulting fiction but as long as it all conforms to players expectations and (often) pre-play assumptions then it's fine.</b></blockquote>\nI wanted to touch a little bit on this, because I think Jesse is onto something important here, and I'm trying to sort it out in my own mind, particularly the bolded part at the end.<br/><br/>I think a lot of times, p-gaming is associated to an extent only with a certain sort of Power Fantasy, generally of the <b>I always Win (right now!!!), because my character is <i>Awesome!!!! </i></b> sort. I think Jesse correctly points out that this is far from the case, provided horrific plot circumstances and outcomes conform to player expectation ( much of it undoubtedly related to the inspirational source material being used).<br/><br/>So what forms does this take? And how does it work with indie-think?<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Player initiated horrors visited on their own character</span><br/>Not everyone does this, and not everyone does it overtly, but it does seem key to some sorts of P-Gaming. When it does happen, or is risked, players seem more comfortable with it.<br/><br/>There do seem to be two or three versions of this, however.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Temporary and for drama</span><br/>The player puts their character out there and fully expects the Gm ( or perhaps other players) to clue to this and make or suggest vile nasty outcome possibilities. OTOH, they expect this to be at most temporary in application. They expect their character will have some chance to reverse the badness, either through their own actions or opportunities provided by the GM, or the actions of other PCs.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It's okay to Die Heroically as part of a Big Showdown</span><br/>Even TPK is okay, as long as there is a point in the story that might as well be labelled "The Big Showdown!!!". P-Gamed Cthulhu seems to follow this formula pretty regularly.<br/><br/>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gritty" P-Gaming means a <b>single</b> main character can buy the farm ( or come to another bad end) before the Big ShowDown, but no more than one or two per session or story chunk.</span>Boromir, Boromir, Boromir. And probably Gandalf, too, at least at Moria, for a short while. Also pretty common in Cthulhu.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Big Showdown and Almost-TPK aka The Sole Survivor and the Sequel/Epilogue</span>Depending on the genre expectations, it may be fairly common to end a Big Showdown with a sole survivor. This is probably especially true for war settings or cthulhu-esque adventures. Heck, it's almost an expected end state in those. In more heroic gaming, particularly of the Fantasy sort or the Pulpish kind,there almost has to be a survivor to pick things up and recruit new allies for another go at the baddies who have temporarily won the day. Especially important in the game that is expected to be ongoing.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rollercoaster Ride Failure and Success</span><br/>In P-Gaming it seems very important that failure <b>must</b> be followed by success in relatively short order. I'm tempted to say that no PC should fail more than twice in a row without at least one small success in the meantime, no matter what. <br/><br/>(Unless of course we're in some sort of situation specific game where a <i>character</i> failure is a success at the <i>player </i>level. Yes, I know that sounds weird, but think about Soap Operas. In that circumstance, the Good Character that falls for the Villainous Seducter's adances, for example, has "failed" at the character level but quite possibly succeeded at the player level.)<br/><br/>Of course, I should probably re-iterate at this point that I think all of those sorts of things are <b>incredibly common</b> in groups that are P-Gaming successfully, but not inherently definitive of the thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279132/#Comment_279132" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T12:37:36+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 12:37PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>I think it absolutely HAS been, successfully.

They have a core mechanic that sort of represents the thematic pulse the game has and then usually a die system that is designed to be flexible enough for the group to sort of make up their own rules for applying it.<br/><br/>In Houses of the Blooded for example in the text there are some rather specific situations where when one person makes a wager the other person has to make an equal number of wagers.  I'd call those specific case rules except I've seen John and others on the forums talk about other cases where they've required players to do this.  So the examples in the books aren't really rules but rather example cases where during play testing that dice trick was applied.  If there's an underlying "rule" for when you make players match wagers and when you don't, I don't know what it is.<br/><br/>Similarly I've been following his live-journal where he writes about the Changeling game he's running.  At one point the characters were trying to kidnap a sleeping vampire.  So John picked up 4d10 and for every action the characters took he rolled.  He told them that if any of them come up 10 the vampire wakes up.  Doing that in game with me would cause me to leave.  That's not in the rules.  That's not how the game works.  But everyone as his table must have been fine with it.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think you can design primordial games.  I think most of Levi's games may work in this space as well.  Lots of gears and widget you use to build your own gears and widgets as needed.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279170/#Comment_279170" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T17:19:23+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  5:19PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have quite enough actual play experience with the Big White Thing to really be definitive, but it feels like it to me.<br/><br/>Strong aesthetic guidance, but not sufficiently concrete to be a canon.

Much further over in that direction and you're left with incoherent mess - and are primordial whether you want to be or not, if you want to play successfully.<br/><br/>Some of Jesse's comments make me wonder if the closest you get is grab-bag "toolkit" systems with no clear criteria for when and how to apply their multiple, sometimes contradictory, rules.

I'm thinking of all those endless debates way back when which focused on "munchkinism" as an endless evil, and all the arguments about "roleplay vs. rollplay", and what makes someone a "real roleplayer"? Advice to the GM that says things like, "That thing the characters are looking for? Just let them find it in the third place they look. The first and second place they look, they're stymied. But wherever they go third, give it to them there." <br/><br/>Isn't that for primordial play? I mean, if you're playing in a conflict resolution situation, or a plain old follow-the-rules sandbox adventure game, or even a freeform roleplaying situation like online play, why would you need advice like "When do I let my players find the clue?"

I think it's GREAT. "vigorous creative agreement" is an offhand reference to something Vincent said: that a lot of play consists of everybody knowing what's supposed to happen next and making it happen ("saying yes"). He's usually designing to interrupt that and bring surprise and novelty in through resolution; but I think it's a fun, functional way to play, just hard to successfully sustain. The illusion of outcomes coming from the fiction or the mechanical rules is there as a fig-leaf to hide the naked fact that what's really going on is group storytelling.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why it's the case that so many players resist acknowledging this, but there is clearly a strong emotional reward that comes from believing the magician's really doing magic and not knowing how the trick is done.<br/><br/>One way in which it works is that immersion is easier if you deny the orchestration of the fiction, or at minimum load it all onto a GM. Another way it works is that this kind of play puts a real premium on (non-mechanical) skill, so doing it successfully - being a "good GM" or a "good roleplayer" becomes a source of pride in itself. There are probably plenty of other rewards.<br/><br/>In response to JD, yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. Or rather, it's not that we don't "realize" that we're doing it, it's that we have plausible deniability in the course of play. Ideally, the wires never show. There's reams and reams of text devoted to hiding the artifice - it must be important to people to hide it. I know I can get my kicks both ways, but I have played with plenty of people who know perfectly well that the GM isn't really pulling a rabbit out of his hat, but still need to believe at some level in the moment of play that he IS.<br/><br/>I guess to me the "primordial" of Primordial Gaming is that it's really just making shit up. Mechanics, setting, etc are all just tools to be manipulated and discarded, intermediaries and screens for the creative power of the people playing.<br/><br/>Once you either grant authority to mechanics/setting/etc in themselves OR overtly acknowledge and formalize the creative act of play, you're not Primordial any more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279258/#Comment_279258" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-04T12:00:34+00:00" title="July  4, 2010 12:00PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>but I have played with plenty of people who know perfectly well that the GM isn't really pulling a rabbit out of his hat, but still need to believe at some level in the moment of play that he IS.</blockquote>\nSee, this is not how I would describe it, or magic, which I performed a lot of at the time I got really interested in RPGs. The audience at a magic show doesn't "need to believe in magic", in fact, the more sophisticated the audience, the more sophisticated the act you can do.  For example, if you sprinkle some yellow feathers over a cup containing a red ball and the ball turns yellow, that's actually more impressive to an audience that <i>does not</i> believe in magic than it is to an audience of young children who may not have fully internalized the fact that balls don't just change color. After all, if the audience believes in magic, all that's happened is a ball has changed color, whoop tee doo. It's only because the audience does not believe in magic, and knows balls don't just change color for no reason, that it works at all.<br/><br/>Every magician who has performed for young children has heard a young child say, "I know how you did it." and provide an explanation that's not only not how they did it, but absolutely, completely implausible and often just as impossible as magic itself.  (My favorite response is, "Don't tell anyone else, it'll be a secret just between us magicians."  It works wonders.)  <br/><br/>Instead of belief in magic, what the audience (and the participators in the RPG style I think you're looking at) has is a <i>willingness to be transported</i>, just like the audience in a flashy but silly Broadway musical or the readers of a weighty fantasy novel.  All audiences have a degree of this, if they are open to the work in any way.  The techniques in RPGs of hiding the wires, as you say, is really no different than literally hiding the wires in a production of Peter Pan. Nobody believes the actor can fly - absolutely nobody - not even for a split second. But we are willing to be transported, willing to imagine a world where <i>Peter Pan</i> can fly, and even to permit ourselves to imagine ourselves in that world, when we, ourselves, applaud to keep Tinkerbell alive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279283/#Comment_279283" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-04T16:45:20+00:00" title="July  4, 2010  4:45PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough.

It really doesn't matter where they came from.<br/><br/>Now, the GM is left with acceptable/wanted ones. Not just only one, but multiple outcomes, all acceptable, but each different ( to what degree, I don't know).<br/>This would seem to fit with some of Jesse's comments as well, too, regarding how horrific outcomes could be acceptable depending on circumstances of the social aspect of the game.<br/><br/>Err, sorry, not sure exactly where that's going, but it seemed relevent.<br/><br/>Comments?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279430/#Comment_279430" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-06T09:28:50+00:00" title="July  6, 2010  9:28AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that does actually get at something interesting. Meaningful stakes-setting is exactly what is going on with this outcome-sorting. In more "hippie" styles of play, this is explicit and connected with the resolution method. In more primordial styles, the system does not support stakes-setting, or there is a technique preference against it. The GM is tasked with adjusting results towards meaningful outcomes on the fly.<br/><br/>A piece of advice I have given and seen given many a time in the land of "good GM practice" is something along the lines of: "...don't make them roll unless you're prepared for something interesting to happen when they fail." The clumsy version of this is that thing I think many of us have seen where the GM just keeps coming up with opportunities for new rolls until something succeeds.<br/><br/>With regard to "bad" outcomes being acceptable... YES. Wanted/Unwanted is the key, and operates at the player level. I'll routinely engineer "bad" outcomes in CoC play, for example - it's just not a good game of CoC if the players solve the mystery and get away largely unscathed, so I have license to engage in rank fuckery to make sure that their clever plans fail. Fortunately, CoC's whacked-out linear probabilities make that happen without my intervention pretty regularly, but part of the expectation is that I will adjust on the fly to make sure things go badly enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279470/#Comment_279470" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-06T14:59:17+00:00" title="July  6, 2010  2:59PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2010 3:00PM by komradebob.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><br/>With regard to "bad" outcomes being acceptable...

This is kinda like stake-setting, but also kinda not.<br/>D) Other players do the same, more or less in character ( "Watch out for that Nazi on the left with the machine gun Indy!!!") but maybe as a sort of aside instead.<br/>E) Some gate-keeper or thee group as a whole seperates out unwanted outcomes and ditches them.<br/>F) If multiple outcomes are still in the wanted outcomes pile, roll randomly between them.<br/><br/>Does this then tend towards producing the whole vigorous agreement concept, but without railroading or walkovers or always triumphal-character or only a single possible outcome everytime?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279507/#Comment_279507" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-06T21:01:49+00:00" title="July  6, 2010  9:01PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well... maybe? What you describe sounds moderately dreadful to me, but I think that's a technique objection rather than anything substantive - it feels rather forced and artificial, and as far as I am concerned one of the appeals of this kind of play is that it works without the level of dual consciousness that this would require. I mean... I, as a player, can SAY stuff in character, but I'm still needing to do a lot of director-level thinking here. My ideal for P-Gaming is that I can play the game about 90% of the time as a player (and often, large stretches of time as GM) just engaged with the fiction and think in terms of "what would be likely to happen next" rather than "what do I want to see next". <br/><br/>I think that's a separate issue, but the whole P-gaming thing is so tightly bound up with technical preferences and in particular matters of stance and immersion that it's hard to disentangle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279578/#Comment_279578" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-07T12:09:54+00:00" title="July  7, 2010 12:09PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. You may well be right on that Mark. Indulge me in a rewrite?<br/>_______<br/>As a GM, it's your job to decide when to make a roll for outcomes in a chancey situation. It's also your job to make the final call on what those outcomes mean. Some possible outcomes are almost guaranteed to go outside of what folks really want out of the play. Ditch those ones. Take 'em right off the table. You should be left with just a couple now, probably of the Yes/Yes And/No/No But  (and related) varieties. Let a die roll randomly decide between them.<br/><br/>As a GM, you should always state outcomes tied to the die reult before the roll is made. This can be as simple as a 50/50 chance, or can be bit more complex, involving multiple outcomes and weighting of results.( <b>Weighting results???</b> This is simply saying that, in yourr opinion, some outcomes are likelier than others. "On a roll of 1-5, Thing A Happens. On a roll of 6, thing B happens". It works pretty much the same with multiple outcomes)<br/><br/>As a player, you can decide if circumstances are chancey too and worth a die roll. The GM is the final voice in whether to go for a die-roll or not, however. If you don't want to step out of character to do that, just pick up the die and make it obvious non-verbally that you think a roll should be done.<br/><br/>As a player, you can also apply this to other players. Just slide a die in front of them. That's a good enough non-verbal indication that you think a roll should be made. It's up to the other player to then pick up the die on their own or to have the GM indicate that they think a roll should be made.<br/><br/>As a player, you're within the rules to suggest different outcomes to the GM, even if your character isn't directly involved. You're also within your rights to indicate outcomes you don't want at all. Whether you do this directly (out of character) or indirectly (through in-character asides) is up to you. As a player, you can do either and switch back and forth between methods during the game based on personal preference and group preference.<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>Admittedly wordy, and could use a fair bit of rewrite to be more directly useful, but that's kinda where I'm going with my thinking.<br/><br/>_____________<br/><br/>Touching a bit on a post upthread, I do kinda agree that this sort of...well method ( I really hate to call it rules exactly) probably really does go best with some sort of setting/situation info rather than as a mechanical thing in itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279592/#Comment_279592" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-07T13:56:38+00:00" title="July  7, 2010  1:56PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's MUCH better.
