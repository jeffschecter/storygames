And that's only half in jest - for example, I haven't had any major hankering for taking my normative theory (as opposed to the non-systematic stuff we do at the Forge every day) public after the Forge theory forums closed down, simply because the alternative forums are full of attitudes founded on ignorance and identity politics. What would the point of doing theory here, for instance, be, when the only interested voices would be those demanding me to justify my temerity in daring to engage in a practice both harmful and foul, galling in requiring one to research prior discourse to understand the proceedings, and one with no practical value to boot.<br/><br/>Or that's my impression, anyway. Discourse is a fragile thing, easily discouraged, especially when there are so many other worthwhile things to be done. I have little difficulty with sharing my theory thinking with my peers in private, after all, so there's little reason to do it in public. The public has plenty of theory to chew on as it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177315/#Comment_177315" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T17:02:18+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  5:02PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2008 5:41PM by JCunkle.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theory is dead!<br/>Long live Theory!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177319/#Comment_177319" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T17:48:33+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  5:48PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To paraphrase Frank Zappa (he was actually talking about jazz)<br/><br/>"Theory isn't dead, it just smells funny"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177320/#Comment_177320" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T17:51:49+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  5:51PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theory isn't dead, the Internet is dead.

And quite honestly, I don't have access to a forum or whatever to ask the questions I have about theory. I tried asking some people on line, in chat, but I got conflicting answers. It seems that there are two prevailing theories in RPG design:<br/>\nRon's - Which has counter-intuitive language and to make it worse, that language has been corrupted by incorrect usage all over the net (i.e., ask 10 people what Gamist means and you get 10 different answers)<br/>\nPundit's - Which is not helpful as his theory postulates that if it is part of a successful game, then it is a working system, otherwise it does not work. Which, while useful as a means of analysis doesn't explain why some games are successful while others are not...<br/>\n  I feel like (and this may be a perception that is not based in reality) that the people who started this little foray into RPG theory are tired of talking about it, so there are no real resources to figure out what I know and what I don't know.<br/>\n  Also, I am not very comfortable posting in AP forums. One, I am concerned that the games I post about may get me labeled as a kind of player I am not. Also, I am not sure how to post details from a 2 hour session from a 2 month old campaign without making a monster post that is unreadable. And even if I did, I am not sure how it applies to a theory question I may have. If I am not sure what Simulationist play is, how can I post an AP account about it and then discuss that? I do understand that with a discussion like "what do Traits really mean in PTA," AP is almost required. But, for basic definitions, I don't know how that applies/helps/works.<br/>\n  And I have read the provisional glossary on two separate occasions and there is a lot of circular references and jargon that is not clearly defined. So, no help there.<br/>\n  So, in summary, I would say Theory is dying because no one is willing to help out the next wave of theorists.<br/>\n  Sorry if this sounds accusatory or defensive, I have just been struggling to become a productive member in theory discussions for 2 years and still feel like an outsider.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177363/#Comment_177363" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T07:58:28+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  7:58AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the wonderful thing about the internet is that all the old discussions and helpful advice are <i>still there</i>.<br/><br/>So you can just go and read them. Also, a lot of people who are part of the blog diaspora have posted simpler, easier explanations of the Big Model on their blogs.<br/><br/>There are many resources like that out there.

I think one of the reasons it was shut down on The Forge is that it was getting in the way of actually making games (this is my perception but look at the 2005 now-forever front page thread about "what is Sim" for a prime example of what I'm talking about). <br/><br/>So, yes, I think it's "dead" but the work--the real work--goes on more profitably without it.<br/><br/>(and there are other theories and some valuable concepts that are, of course, still in use--but not the single iconic idea of a grand, unified, GNS).<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177397/#Comment_177397" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T10:10:36+00:00" title="November  5, 2008 10:10AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>If you're looking for big-T Theory written out in long articles... honestly, that's hardly ever where the most interesting stuff happens anyway.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's kinda what I think too.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amagi-games.org/tiki-index.php?page=Theory" rel="nofollow">Also, check out Levi's stuff</a> (like The Big Muddle). Its detail is right at the edge of what I find tolerable to read about gaming without actually gaming, and it directly ties everything to play. It's really good stuff, even if at times a lot of it seems like, "Well, duh!"<br/>The only reason we're not all talking about it all the time is because Levi hasn't acted like a prima donna/shitbag online yet. Once he starts throwing tantrums and spewing ridiculous shit, people will pay more attention to his cool essays, I think.<br/><br/>Levi's pretty much the central theorist regarding RPGs in the past two years. His shit is sensible, and always can point to behaviors seen at the table without having to determine with the terms he is using mean first before holding a discussion.<br/><br/>The important elements of theory for me are the pieces that you can take and apply directly to gaming. "If you do X, Y may result". "If you make relationship maps, you may gain these benefits at the table. Also, here's how to make them, implement them, make them fun, etc". <br/>These pieces are small, and not large. Which is why they lack the "bigness" of a unifying theory, those theories that draw discussion like mass into a black hole, most of it involving understanding what the theory is trying to say (and getting wrong/right, mostly on the accounts of its vagueness). Like all the GNS stuff.<br/><br/>Reasoned critique of games, rules, gameplay style and the like aren't going anywhere. Just the tools that those few who dig into it use are changing, and so are the means of using those tools (more Amagi Games mini-essays, blogs, and S-G "play advice" posts; less "let's brawl over ideas like back on Usenet"). <br/><br/>Hopefully, the desire to make universal theories will be pushed back in favor of more small theories that look at specific realms of activity, which prove more pragmatic/useful in the end. Also, hopefully I'll get a pegasus for Christmas this year. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177404/#Comment_177404" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T10:41:05+00:00" title="November  5, 2008 10:41AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2008 10:44AM by misuba.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Theory isn't dead, the Internet is dead.

But then there is the fact that I don't know how to do it. And I am not entirely sure what the point is. Plus, from a logical perspective, I think I know why something worked (or didn't) in my sessions, but that is because I know the people I play with pretty well. But, I am not sure how posting what is essentially a random AP account from one of my games will help me understand what simulationism actually means. If I don't know what it means, how can I post an AP account that references it. And what are the odds that the answer is going to be "That is not Sim play"? And how do you advance the discussion after that?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, I don't know what blogs to follow and its hard to follow lots of blogs (especially when I don't know what they want to write about, how often they intend to post and whether or not they look at the comments or not).<br/>\n  And if google "gamism rpg" I get 8,470 matches. If somebody knows this stuff and is willing to help, how do I find them?<br/>\n  I thought about just PM'ing Ron, but from his articles, I am afraid that his choice of words would be more confusing than helpful (I don't have an issue with "Brain Damage," but "chest bumping" was a puzzle). Also, sorry to keep picking on Ron. I think he has done a lot for theory and a lot of role playing gamers.

The Forge label has lost all relevance but I see the basic ideas filtering out being restated in peoples own words and being accepted and not just by those who agreed with the theory.   I know the thread you speak of Neko and I'm amazed by the number of people who claim to disagree with the Big Model but when they restate what they believe it's virtually in line with it, all they've done is excised a misinterpretation of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll agree that nobody will ever agree what sim means but really I dont think it's all that important.

More intimate discussion goes on rather than a million people putting in their opinion and taking the discussion in 15 different directions.

Most of the APs are just plain cool, without asking any questions (personally, I like to cu to the chase: "Here was my Session; Here's what I need help with/what went wrong; Here's the kind of advice I'm looking for; Go"), others go deep into terminology-land, complete with having to back up and redefine terms (which have been around for years) to continue, etc.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem like it's leaking out into "forming new games", but rather it's being used as takeaways to the participants of the threads.

and frankly, I'd like written, long-form academic style articles. With citations. And a journal to submit them to. With an archive.</blockquote>\nIn that case, you should submit articles to the yearly Knutepunkt/Solmukohta books. Many participants want that to turn into an academic journal.<br/><br/>That's what I did! The article is called "The Ironical Rhetoric of the Real in RPGs," and it examine a snippet of actual play through the lens of discourse analysis, which I think has a lot to offer RPG theory by satisfying the desire to consider what happens around the table (as well as what goes on in the fiction and in the game-mechanistic currency flows) as essential to understanding game play. My brother and I talk about it on his actual play podcast, <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/?p=84" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a>.<br/><br/>I hope it gets accepted! In any event, I'm beginning to twist my academic research agenda to point at role-playing games as a research site for discourse analysis. I saw a call for papers the other day for a popular culture studies conference. I'm planning to submit something to that.

Light bulbs didn't make the maxwell equations obsolete.<br/><br/>That the pace of advancement is now more slow should not be a surprise for anyone. In 2000-2003 there was a big bang after a couple of decades of negation of every value in game design. More than new theories, it was a moment of clarity about what we really have learned about games in years of gaming. It was as a dam finally broke and it came a flood of ideas. Now ideas come one at a time, not in floods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177686/#Comment_177686" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T10:08:01+00:00" title="November  7, 2008 10:08AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Moreno,<br/><br/>Fair points all.  I think Forge theory was fruitful, though I don't think it was right (though I'd rather not here get into why I think it was wrong, it's off topic and would bore people).<br/><br/>And certainly your argument is a credible one, I just personally think that what happened is that a group of gamers (let's call them narrativists, for want of a better term) were poorly served by existing games.  A theory, and there were plenty before the Forge and some as well developed (GDS), helped people identify what they were missing, they went out and made games inspired by that theory and there was an explosion of creativity that is now slowing (and that may be natural as you note).<br/><br/>That's one view on what happened, others are certainly viable and yours is among those viable views, it's just not mine.  I think the theory was wrong, but contained a truth, that there is a group of gamers who want stuff that nar games deliver, and I think previous theories ignored those folk.  GNS in my view ignored other folk, but those other folk were already being served, so it didn't matter that much.<br/><br/>But when I said, in the quoted section, that theory might have served its purpose what I was trying to get at was that the advancement now comes through the games themselves, that games are how advances are now made.  I supported the Forge closing its theory forums, I thought then and think now that their useful life had passed, and the time had come to develop theory (if one develops it at all) as a part of game development, not something separate to it.  Basically, I was agreeing with your first para.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas" title="Jiituomas"><img alt="Jiituomas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiituomas">Jiituomas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177690/#Comment_177690" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T10:39:28+00:00" title="November  7, 2008 10:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the academic side of things: I've written (or co-authored) a total of six formal rpg theory articles this year. Some for academic, some for non-academic publication channels. Several are still in peer review, hopefully appearing next year. Many other people are doing the same. At least half a dozen highly suitable ludological journals exist, plus a whole bunch of others may take such texts. And then there's the Knutepunkt book, etc. Journals do exist for those who go look for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the empirics side: I ran a project of creating test games for several major larp theories, 2004-2007, and published the results. While design-oriented (and in my view too often still bound in obsolete assumptions - as was much of the Nordic larp theory I tested), a lot of the theory-based  work on the Forge is doing likewise: actually testing ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best role-playing game I've seen in years, "Stalker" by Ville Vuorela (not available in English yet, sorry) is a product of _reverse_ role-playing theory: The author seems to hate formal rpg theory material so much that he ended up refining an implicit, unexplicated design theory of its own as a response, and used it to create one hell of a role-playing game. So there's new theory appearing all the time - sometimes in highly formal, academic circles, at other times as hidden parts of successful games. But by no means is it dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177691/#Comment_177691" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T10:45:42+00:00" title="November  7, 2008 10:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jiituomas, I'm gonna open a new thread, because I want to hear about "Stalker".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177694/#Comment_177694" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T10:47:29+00:00" title="November  7, 2008 10:47AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2008 10:47AM by D-503.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jiituomas, has that Stalker game any link to the Tarkovsky movie/Roadside Picnic?<br/><br/>If so, how does it compare with Praedor?<br/><br/>Possibly a separate topic, I grant you.<br/><br/>Edit:  Dang that Kitkowski boy's fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177746/#Comment_177746" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T21:25:05+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  9:25PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I find it kinda amusing that alot of this (the big bad voodoo of theory) gets attributed to discussion/definitional philosophy (semanitcs, the actual kind and not just the word people throw arround to mean arguing about arguing) but i really am thinking it has a lot more to do with identitiy politics than anything. You have a bunch of people who coming into this theory thing recently (like myself and others) who really dont give a flying fig about 6 years of message board conversations, much about ron except to be a little put off for some of his stupidier and taken out of context statements, and the big model, or assimilating the views of those people who put alot of work into this at that previous time (and rightfully deserve recognition for what they did then) <br/><br/>well i hope im not ruining the zen, but i make you this promise, I will continue posting, I will continue making games, and I will continue to ignore most of what has come before me as the gosspel, because im pretty sure they got it wrong. I will continue to try to define things, and I will consider both theory and metatheory, I will argue semantics, and I will for the love of all that is holy continue to do so.

There are so many things that we take for granted, like considering different agenda, or playstyles, or whatever you want to call it.  Before theory, there was only good and bad roleplaying.  That's just one example.
