I wouldn't let them, because it seemed wrong that a 6-hit threat "That ape's gonna smash the elevator controls!" can be dealt with by saying "I stun him so he doesn't smash the elevator controls" and a single hit. On the other hand it seemed off to only let them capture opponents alive with an Electro-Blaster, so mostly the Electro-Blaster ended up doing nothing, and the other guns ended up being overlooked. I also didn't like that there's three types of guns to shoot with Commando, but you don't get different types of melee weapons to use with Warrior, or different types of science to know with Professor. I'd probably just fold all guns into other equipment and have it provide bonus dice as appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is great for a DM with limited time to prepare. The entirety of my prepared material was: the Venusian ambassadress is visiting Rocket City. The delegation meeting her included Professor Bradbury, the famous archeologist. The meeting will be interrupted by an attack of the hideous Martian white apes who will try to kidnap the ambassadress, because she is actually an archeologist/secret agent investigating the ruins of a love-o-tron machine from a time when Venus had an outpost on Mars, and someone wants to rebuild it and use if for nefarious purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was severe overpreparation. What I ended up using was: the Venusian ambassadress is visiting Rocket City, and white apes try to kidnap her. Everything else was supplied by the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Previously, on Danger Patrol... section was similar. The players dropped a bunch of crazy ideas, but we only used a single one: the Alien Explorer is analyzing a rock and he exclaims "That's not a rock, that's a hive of miniature Palindromic Cultists!" and a bunch of miniature cultists swarm out of the rock and start tossing lines at him to pull him down. Cut! Everyone was so :what: that the Cultists were in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore weak threats is more interesting than fewer big threats, which was kind of disappointing, since one of the things I like about abstract games like this is that "5 white apes" is handled using the same mechanism as 5 x "white ape", only there's 10 times less things to keep track of. But it turns out 5 x "white ape" makes for a more exciting fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players stuck very closely to 2 danger dice. Not sure why, perhaps "take 1-3 danger dice!" makes 2 always seem like a moderate middle ground?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Danger 1 threat move (the next player to fight the threat takes an additional danger die) seems like a non-event: since the players pick the number of their danger die, they just pick one less before taking the "mandatory" one, effectively ignoring it. It should probably be something else: "automatic danger +1" or "needs 5 to hit" or "1s count for double danger"...?<br/>\n<br/>\nCompletely forgot about Resistance, Staged Threats, Vehicle Hits, even though there were situations where they might have spiced things up. Oh well, time enough for advanced rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn actual play report probably to follow once we're able to collate all the outlandish stuff that came up.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261821/#Comment_261821" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T13:52:49+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  1:52PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff - I chuckled at your "severe overpreparation" comment.<br/><br/>You said: "I'd probably just fold all guns into other equipment and have it provide bonus dice as appropriate." I think your suggestion is now official, from one of the first long danger patrol threads.<br/><br/>Also, "The Danger 1 threat move (the next player to fight the threat takes an additional danger die) seems like a non-event:" - this has been observed too, and there was a suggested fix, but I can't remember off-hand. I'm sure someone else will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261831/#Comment_261831" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T14:46:46+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  2:46PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the AP and feedback!

I knew we were humming along when either a player was exceeding the 3-die limit by the amount of danger sh/e was trying to pull in, or when everyone else at the table was "Wait, there's falling debris!
