Someone suggested we use Google Docs, because you can see what people are typing as they type, and it has a separate chat window for out of character. A few days before our game started, I found <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17890/urban-shadows-an-urban-fantasy-rpg-powered-by-the-apocalypse/p1" rel="nofollow">Urban Shadows</a>, a modern dark fantasy (Dresden Files + WoD) Apocalypse World hack. I wanted to report on the game, and using Google Docs. <br/><br/>First cool thing about Google Docs is: You can read the entire thing! This is about 2 hours of talking over the internet and making characters, after which we hung up and just used the chat. <br/><br/>Chapter 1: The Abandoned Theatre - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlcZFxlE0_8v0z_ZBLPiVjPrBEU5IDHbCPmOxYTCfjo/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlcZFxlE0_8v0z_ZBLPiVjPrBEU5IDHbCPmOxYTCfjo/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>Characters - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nOLaiwRCR_zarx0pmDfIf2a6U5ouWY8Z50SOfstJ3bI/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nOLaiwRCR_zarx0pmDfIf2a6U5ouWY8Z50SOfstJ3bI/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/><b>Urban Shadows</b><br/><br/>Urban shadows was really fun. I was very excited after reading the playbooks. They're really nice, and full of things that look fun to play. The players chose a werewolf and a wizard, and the werewolf decided she was trying to be good: to fight her nature. So, they decided they were roommates, and went around being good guys. <br/><br/>It was really easy to think up content, and I like the idea of having an open "city" in the same way dungeon world has an open world. <br/><br/>The moves all seemed well done, but we got confused when it came to performing stunts. I've only played Dungeon World (not AW), and they have "Defy Danger" as a catch-all. No such move exists here, and I really struggled to figure out what to have the werewolf roll when she decided to chase a man onto a rooftop. <br/><br/>In DW, I would have had her roll Defy Danger Dex or something to do it fast enough to get up there before he could set up. In Urban Shadows, it seemed like I was supposed to have her roll "Take a Chance", but she had high blood, not heart, and wanted to use it. Also, it wasn't that risky or stupid. I just wanted to roll the dice to see how the rooftop scene would play out. Any suggestions? The same question came up again in combat. In DW I would have people dodge out of the way if an attack was coming. What do you do without a move like that? Just ask them what they want to do after dodging and roll that move? I used Defy Danger to scale up the difficulty of encounters, and don't really know what to do without it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I don't really understand highlighting stats. In DW, you get an XP on a miss. We just used that in this game, because highlighting stats just seems like useless book-keeping. What's the point? <br/><br/>Anyway, it was great. Read the game and let me know if you have any questions. <br/><br/><b>Google Docs </b><br/><br/>Playing in Google Docs turned out to be pretty nice. It was really great to be able to see what people were typing as they went. It sped things up considerably. There was no dice roller, so I just had the players roll and report what they got. <br/><br/>We were slowed down a little bit by the temptation to make things too narrative, and spend too much time thinking and editing what we wrote, but it was pretty quick overall. We would frequently type something, then go back and edit it for detail. In fact, the players would often be improving a description while the other player was on stage. We were able rearrange the order of things when they didn't make sense. It was pretty cool. <br/><br/>The major downside was that without audio, the players were confused a couple times about what was happening. I would explain it in the narration, and sometimes in the chat, but they still ended up confused. All in all it was good though. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422469/#Comment_422469" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-05T17:04:52+00:00" title="October  5, 2013  5:04PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, thanks for posting this.<br/><br/>I'd like to address your Urban Shadows questions if I may.<br/><br/>Regarding DW's Defy Danger, Take A Chance is the parallel move in US. It doesn't offer players the chance to use any stat for it though (this is common for for Apoc World hacks). But as the MC you can make custom moves on the spot when you need them. If you wanted a Defy Danger type move you could use Take A Chance as your guide but let them roll with other stats. I do have to ask though, if there was almost no risk, why roll dice at all? And having a low Heart doesn't excuse players from rolling moves, don't let them min-max their characters, they should roll all stats equally. If the werewolf wants to roll Blood, they need to Unleash, Threaten or Retreat.<br/><br/>As for using moves in combat, could you elaborate on how you do this in DW? If your npc makes an attack do you then ask the players to Defy Danger to dodge it?<br/><br/>Highlighted Stats are taken from Apoc World directly. The purpose is that other players and the MC inform your roleplay. If you have Heart and Blood highlighted, they're telling you that they want to see you be physical and charismatic. Its a very fun mechanic.<br/><br/>I hope that covers most of it. I am happy to try and answer any other questions you may have. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422516/#Comment_422516" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-06T14:27:34+00:00" title="October  6, 2013  2:27PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            seanhess, I am a big fan of highlighted stats .... a far better way to grab xp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/seanhess" title="seanhess"><img alt="seanhess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/seanhess">seanhess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422519/#Comment_422519" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-06T15:08:12+00:00" title="October  6, 2013  3:08PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Highlighted stats: cool. I think I get it. <br/><br/>So in this case, the player deliberately wanted to get to the roof before the bad guy. The bad guy had a head start, but I wanted to let the player try. Should I just decide he can't? It's not danger, but the bad guy will probably get to the roof first. Blood seems like the obvious characteristic to do something fast. <br/><br/>Maybe it was just partly that the characters expected to make a climbing roll of some kind. I mean, in traditional systems, you always call for a climbing roll because they might fall or get stuck. Maybe the point is that isn't interesting in this game, so I shouldn't ask for a roll for climbing. <br/><br/>In DW, I usually make bad guys harder by narrating several fictional advantages. Maybe the monster has tentacles that whip around, or flames that shoot out around him. You have to defy danger before making the move you wanted to make. It's the only way I know of to let bad guys be awesome. How would you do it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422526/#Comment_422526" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-06T19:20:34+00:00" title="October  6, 2013  7:20PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the player wants their protagonist to beat the bad guy to the roof, there is plenty of danger involved in that. Does the bad guy take some shots at them as they try to overtake them? Does the character fall from a height by trying to rush ahead? Does someone dangerous and powerful witness their actions? That all sounds like their Taking a Chance to me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But when in doubt, if you don't need a roll, just give it to them. What's really important is what will happen when they get to that rooftop in front of the bad guy. That's gonna be juicy.<br/><br/>You can still give your NPC's narrative advantages like you do in DW. If you think that a roll is required before a character can do a particular action, Take a Chance is the go-to move. Remember, Heart is not just charm, but also luck. If the werewolf is facing down a powerful warlock and wants to close with them but the warlock has spells ready to launch when they try, Take a Chance to get up there without being struck by magic. One little trick I use to make a tough NPC a worthwhile challenge is this quick and dirty custom move;<br/>"When (insert NPC name) enters a conflict, they hold 1 (or 2, 3, etc). They can spend their hold 1-for-1 to do one of the following."<br/>Here are some examples of things they can do with their hold.<br/>-Lash out with a x-harm attack at someone nearby<br/>-Ignore damage from a mundane physical attack<br/>-Blind an opponent with magic temporarily<br/>-Close the distance between them and someone else in a flash<br/>-Hide themselves from sight using glamours<br/>I think you get the idea. With about 1 minute of work (in your head even) you can create a powerful NPC who will be a force to be reckoned with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422559/#Comment_422559" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T13:28:33+00:00" title="October  7, 2013  1:28PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, in DW, when you narrate the bad guys as having a fictional advantage which requires PCs to Defy Danger before they can get close enough to attack...<br/><br/>It is not the case that you use the rule "this character has [trait x], so you must roll to Defy Danger to bypass it and get into attack range".<br/><br/>It is the case that the character has flailing tentacles, and if a PC tries to just walk up and stab them, it won't work out well for them. Maybe the player goes the direct route and says "well I duck and weave between the tentacles, trying to get close enough to stab" and hey, that sounds like Defying Danger.<br/><br/>If the moves in Urban Shadows are well-designed, you should be able to do the same thing even if there were no catch-all Defy Danger move. Narrate the kind of advantage you want the NPC to have. Can the PC trigger the great finishing move they would like to? If not, then you have succeeded: your narration made it so that the table agreed that the PC could not "just walk up and stab it". What do they do instead? Is that a move?<br/><br/>To the extent that the fiction informs the moves, giving someone an advantage means they have something that provides an advantage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423108/#Comment_423108" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T04:55:11+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  4:55AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2013 4:55AM by revel911.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JonatonK, I don't see where the confusion is. Defy Danger and Taking a Chance are very similar.<br/><br/>"When you take a chance and do something risky, dangerous or downright stupid, roll+Heart."<br/><br/>In your first example, your player is trying to get ahead of the bad guy, so unless he some kind of move that allows him to go faster, then he must take chances to do so. That means sprinting at full speed, while being less observant of his ground or his surroundings.<br/><br/>In your second example, again ... Taking a Chance.
