The focus is higher education, so there will be a teaching and learning focus - I want to play a game that supports the transmission of knowledge and perspective that could be shoe-horned into a variety of pedagogies.  The game needs to be dead simple, as an exemplar, but functional, because I'll take it apart after we play.  And to add a little complexity, the conference focus is "green education" or something, so i was asked to include an environmental theme if possible.  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/cap_and_trade/cap_and_trade_01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's what I came up with</a>.  It's designed as a classroom exercise, with teams taking the various roles.  It isn't supposed to model reality, but it is supposed to get participants talking and listening about cap-and-trade a tiny bit.<br/><br/>So I'd love some feedback - is the time frame too compressed?  Budgeting for overruns and explanation, I think this will take 40 minutes.  five, five minute rounds.  Is it understandable?  There will be three voting boxes, one each for Growth, Sustainability, and Governance.  Does it seem fun for each faction?  What are the likely outcomes?<br/><br/>I'd love some stronger arguments on the Growth side, or a way to mechanically reinforce their power in the system, but I want to keep the media bottleneck.  I guess I could start out by saying "Growth already has one free Influence." Or I could cheat and not tell the participants.<br/><br/>Thanks for any thoughts!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234212/#Comment_234212" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T06:50:18+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  6:50AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, why would anyone vote for Governance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234215/#Comment_234215" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T07:01:12+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  7:01AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2009 7:02AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Legislators will surely vote for themselves, and Lobbyists can give them Influence as well, rather than rolling the dice on the Media.  <br/><br/>That said, I can't see why Citizens would ever vote for Governance. <br/><br/>Seems weak.

So if they expend their resources to stay in power, they won't do much good. If the citizens vote for them, they might spend their resources to work on Growth or Sustainability (to get more votes). Or they might put their own resources into Governance, as well, to really cement their power (at the risk of losing votes).<br/><br/>For this to work, a Citizen vote on Governance needs to be more powerful than a Legislator's vote on Governance, but the Legislator's vote should be more powerful if put in any other category. Thus the machine works best if Citizens vote on Legislators, who vote on what the Citizens want. But the interest of the Legislators is best served by putting their own votes, as well as those of the Citizens, into Governance (because that way they win). In fact, they lose if the system works the above-mentioned way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234218/#Comment_234218" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T07:24:11+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  7:24AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, uh, the practical suggestion of rules-change would be:<br/><br/>* Each citizen vote on Governance is worth two points.<br/>* Each legislator vote on Growth or Sustainability is worth two points.<br/><br/>That should fix the problem and give the Legislators a reason to make grand promises and then fail to uphold them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234219/#Comment_234219" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T07:28:55+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  7:28AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then again, a game theory analysis of this would reveal:<br/><br/>* The Legislators would do best in voting for themselves in the last round, since there are no repercussions.<br/><br/>* The Citizens know this, and will thus not vote for the Legislators in the last round.<br/><br/>* The Legislators know this, and will thus vote for themselves in the second to last round, since theit votes won't make the Citizens vote on them in the last round anyway.<br/><br/>* And so on.<br/><br/>The game breaks down if everyone behaves in a rational manner.

However, you could let the Citizens give their votes to the Legislator of their choice, and the Legislator makes the decision. That could work. Or just remove the Legislators, but that might be too simplistic.<br/><br/>I think there's a strong risk people will simply decide at the start and then vote regardless of the arguments from the media. Possibly this could be counteracted by having a "theme" in each phase. But then the whole game wouldn't be about Cap and Trade. That would be hard. Instead, you'd have one issue on stake at every phase, decided by votes. The side who wins the most issues wins the game. This adds a measure of gambling, since you don't want to spend too many resources on one issue and not have any left for the others. It also lets Citizens have more nuanced opinions than just "Save the planet" or "Save the economy". Basically, you'd have five conflicts with set stakes and a vote-and-resource-based resolution system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234240/#Comment_234240" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T10:03:58+00:00" title="September 25, 2009 10:03AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bow to others on the game-theoretic analysis, but here's one more point that the growth folks might try to make (and which is current in the philosophical/moral literature):<br/><br/>"Growth" can sound kind of evil when you're thinking mostly about Western corporations making money.  But economic growth is a really important way that countries like India, China, and Ghana have cut their rates of crushing poverty (plausibly, it's been more successful than any aid program - hence the "trade not aid" faction).  <br/><br/>Essentially, what implementing a program that reduces environmental damage at the cost of heavy economic drag is asking people to make a trade-off between quality of life *now* (or in the near future, at least) vs. quality of life for future generations.  It is not at all clear that all reasonable and moral people living in poverty now would take that trade - especially if the magnitudes of the goods are not equal (e.g., if a large chunk of quality-now needs to be sacrificed for a relatively smaller chunk of quality-future - similar to the point made above).  And if you add in the fact that poor-people-now are being asked not just to sacrifice in the name of poor-people-future, but also rich-people-future (Americans, e.g., as well as future Indians, Chinese, and Ghanaians who can be expected to have greater economic resources than current ones), the trade can look even worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234242/#Comment_234242" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T10:29:48+00:00" title="September 25, 2009 10:29AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, I don't want "growth" to be the kneejerk evil option.  <br/><br/>How about this:<br/><br/>Legislators and Citizens each have two voting boxes, for Growth or Sustainability.  <br/><br/>Lobbyists can give Influence to Legislators directly,and Legislators spend it out in the open for everybody to see.

One guy tried to cheat, which delighted me (I didn't interfere - the guy he was trying to co-opt didn't want to go along with his scheme).  <br/><br/>My follow-on presentation is <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/ctc_game_talk/" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you are interested.  <br/><br/>I learned that the citizens need more to do - other than voting, they are pretty passive and just caused trouble because they were a little bored.  Also, the timing rapidly re-adjusted to 3 minutes of interaction followed by two minutes controlled by the media per round, and a total of four rounds.  Otherwise it worked great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238941/#Comment_238941" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T19:49:38+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  7:49PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I learned that the citizens need more to do - other than voting, they are pretty passive and just caused trouble because they were a little bored.</blockquote>\nBest emergent behaviour I've heard about all day.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
