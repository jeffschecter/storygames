Some of us really appreciated short-and-punchy, followed by a nice long break. <br/><br/>Walking Eye: well nuts, now that we've all met I probably should add your podcast to my listening list. I'm gonna do nothing but listen to podcasts soon. Stop being so thoughtful and funny, damn you. <br/><br/>Uh what else...in the abstract I'm disappointed my dance card was so bwhq-centered, but in the specific I loved every event. Spent more time bullshitting with Vx than playing his games. Obviously what's needed is a five day event.<br/><br/>Last note: been to NYC twice now and twice Ive had only mediocre food. What's up with THAT?

But I would like to learn. So I played 3 Apocalypse World games at Burning Con. This is what I learned\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Highlighting Stats: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Originally they didn't click for me, but I like them now. Why? Thanks to Meg, she did the simplest thing\u2026 when you highlight stats, you don't do it as a player, do it as a character. "Bob, last time you lost your shit and I got my hand chopped off because you ran away. I want you to prove that you can stay clam under pressure\u2026 highlight Cool."<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>HX: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- The games that worked best were the ones where the HX descriptions were tight. Especially if we used these descriptions to explain why we needed each other. Meg rocked this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Playbooks: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Handing out sets of Playbooks with specific roles worked better than just saying "play anything." For example, "someone play the Operator and the rest her crew from these options." Jim did this well (who I believe was following Kira's lead). Matt Wilson will try to take credit!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Playing With Time: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- After the first 1-2 hours, say the first session is over. Do HX. Say 1 week or 1 month has passed. Let the complications from the first session grow, ask people what they did during that time, have them roll something, start back in media res. That last point should be repeated, if you let time pass, you can easily start in media res multiple times in the game. Also if you do HX again, and no one knows each other more, it signals to everyone something went wrong. Jim did a great job with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Help Confusion: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- There were different ideas of how Helping worked. Do I help/hinder before or after a roll? If 1 person helps, can another hinder? Can multiple people help? What seemed to work best is limiting 1 help and 1 hinder to any 1 roll. Helping/Hindering after the roll seemed the most fun. Either way, set the expectations up front. Vincent did a good job managing all this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>+1 Forward &amp; Reading: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Using "Read a Situation" is often forgotten and when it is used, often the+1 Forward part is missed. I'm not sure why this happened. Sometimes when someone Read a Situation, they were given answers they already knew, so maybe that's why (but you would still get the +1 Forward). Maybe playing other RPGs train us to avoid perception checks? I don't know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Go Aggro vs. Seize By Force: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- There is still confusion over these. I found an easy way to remember the difference (not the only way, and not the only difference) is if the other person can hurt you back right now, it's probably Seize By Force. Vincent did a great job clearing up any confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Most Problems Happened Because: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Players sometimes didn't describe what they were doing. Instead they said, "I go aggro." Most scenes that were weak were because of this. If the GM just lets me "go aggro" and then I get a mixed result, the GM often stalls because without context, offering a hard choice or some other mixed result is confusing and has little to draw from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Making NPCs Feel Real: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Is key. Jim rocked this. Maybe he rocked this too well! I was scared.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Moves Snowball: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Since moves are very in the moment, letting everyone use 1-3 linked moves at a time instead of jumping between players after they make 1 move, actually speeds up the game. Vincent did a great job with linking moves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Spotlight: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Was sometimes a problem. I don't know why.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Faceless: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n- OMG faceless is awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348986/#Comment_348986" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T14:53:45+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  2:53PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think at the moment, few people except maybe John Harper and Vincent Baker have run AW a lot, and a lot at Cons.<br><br>Really, the player shouldn't ever say something like "I Go Aggro" but rather the MC should be like "seems like you're Go Aggro, roll it." <br><br>The Moves are about a back and forth between the Player and the MC, not between Players, even in PvP. I think a lot of confusion comes from the players [myself included] taking over MC stuff and the MC delegating the wrong kinds of MC stuff to the players. <br><br>It's my conviction that only the MC should ever call for a roll and it's always their decision what move that is. The Player's Moves are prompts for the MC and not sovereign things the the player can do. OCC negotiation and metagaming are fine and to be expected here, but ultimately it's the MC's call when and what moves get made, and how. When it comes to the raw mechanics, the Player's should be in this 'mother may I' kinda mode at best. Unlike in DnD or whatever where you have to say shit like "I cast Magic Missle" or "I use my Cleave Attack."<br><br>They should focus on describing their characters actions, thoughts, words and feelings. That's it. This is tough because we've moved away from sovereign GM authority toward Player empowerment in indie gamer culture. Apocalypse World relies on a strict and wise dictator to work. Otherwise, the choices aren't hard or meaningful.<br><br>So, for this to work, the MC needs a strong command of the rules and a strong command of the table itself. Again, this is more traditional model of table dynamics but one that is absolutely critical for AW to work. AW play is the player's describing their characters and the MC making many moment-to-moment micro-fiats about when and where the rules are applied, in addition to coming up with new rules.<br><br>The thing with the "you're an Operator and their crew" is something I first saw John Harper do a couple of years ago at GPNW. I think it was what he was doing at cons during the playtest phase.<br><br>As far as a Con game goes, having a really strong setting established with all the NPC basically named and ready to go. I think this is really the sticking point. All that build your setting stuff is great for a campaign but a total waste of time for a one-shot. The setting, the maelstrom, &amp;c needs to be worked out in detail. So, it's not "Iris, who do you get your water from?" but "That morning, when you go to the well Roflball's waiting for you." I think during a Con game all the player's energy should go towards fleshing out their character and zero of it should be used for the setting, even to the point where the playbooks with Holdings, Gigs or whatever should already have most of the options picked for them, leaving just a few options open.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348989/#Comment_348989" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T15:36:38+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  3:36PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wooo Faceless.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Bret">@Bret</a>: Yeah, I don't know.</blockquote>\nMe neither! :?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349014/#Comment_349014" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T23:18:41+00:00" title="November 15, 2011 11:18PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br>Also, Shane is the best house guest.

The four of you were an intimidating bunch to try and keep up with.<br><br>That was only the second AW one-shot I've run, and the challenge of setting enough stuff up in advance while still allowing the PCs some latitude to build a structure they find interesting feels like the toughest balancing act. I suspect that Orlando is right on the money: especially in one-shots, the MC needs to be bold and cue the moves aggressively. But what a fun game, you guys were fantastic!<br><br>The rest of my 11.11.11 report: I played Sebastian Baker's 'Blaster for Hire' and had great, goofy fun with it, basically playing Princess Leia to Vincent's Chewbacca: "Sneeblar Gooblett! Only you could be so bold!". It was great fun, and Seb has a promising future ahead of him as a game author if he decides to go that route.<br><br>Slot 2 was John's <i>Dogs</i> game, where I got to play a female dog raised as a boy to replace a lost son until she was taken away form her father at about 12 or so and sent to Dogs school. It was one of the more emotionally intense games I've played ever, and my first AP experience of Dogs, making completely clear to me why the game inspires the fierce devotion it deserves.<br><br>Third slot was the AW game John talked about above, set in a post-30s Chicago on the site of the 'Century of Progress' exposition. They were great, I wish I had been just a smidgen better prepped, but they did such a great job I mostly sat back and let them wrestle with the Threats, though I definitely do owe Kira a game with a few dead MALE hookers sometime in the future (maybe Origins next year). Tangentially, Luke's requirement that everyone who attends run a game is a really important part of this Con, and a big contributor to the highly social aspect of it. I probably wouldn't have had the confidence to do so my first time without the requirement, but am so glad I did.<br><br>Despite my near-catatonic state Saturday night, I staggered in for Orly's Alpha playtest of his cyberpunk-flavored AW hack on Sunday afternoon. It was neat to see something coming together, and I hope the feedback we gave on our play-through was helpful. It was cool to have an hour or two to stroll around the Village and chat gaming with him before our pizza dinner. Extra points for the fun (though sadly cut-short) Parsley session we all shared before we had to break to clean up.<br><br>Since I moved from MA, where I gamed 2-3 times/week at the shop, I have gone largely cold turkey for nearly 3 months now. I couldn't have asked for a better fix. John, you'll need to step up your efforts to NOT make weekly gaming happen if that's how good it is. : )<br><br>-JC                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349103/#Comment_349103" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-17T05:30:00+00:00" title="November 17, 2011  5:30AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>I got to play a female dog raised as a boy to replace a lost son until she was taken away form her father at about 12 or so and sent to Dogs school.
