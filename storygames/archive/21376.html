(At least that's how I've interpreted the two moves - else why are you getting hurt?) Go Aggro, on the other hand, triggers when the subject of the violence doesn't fight back.<br/><br/>A bit of an aside: Is there a reason that "suck it up and force your hand" is only available on the 10+? Seems like it should be an option on the 7-9 since the 10+ is the better result.<br/><br/>Outside of GA/SBF, I haven't seen a system where the intent of the subject of violence is taken into consideration prior to initiating violence...at least not one that does it very well. Burning Wheel and its descendants do to some extent, but many of those systems feel muddled and unclear. There's not a lot of guidance on how to implement opposing intents (major/minor compromise is a bit insubstantial). The Fate system suffers from similar problems.<br/><br/>Are there other systems that explicitly take into account opposing intents? I'm talking about things like, "You want to beat your opponent into submission, and he wants to knock you down so he can run out the side door," then the mechanics determine who succeeds at his intent (with the possibility of both sides gaining their respective intents). Beyond violence, it could be broadened to include things like, "You want to convince the goblin king to help you, and he wants his court jester to pick your pocket while you're negotiating," or "the sheep wants to roam the countryside and you want to herd it back to the rest of the flock."<br/><br/>Apocalypse World's GA/SBF seem to be the closest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467958/#Comment_467958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T17:59:11+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  5:59PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2017 5:59PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to read "go aggro" again: on a 7-9, you can choose to cave, suck it up, OR pick an option from the list. One of the factors for how effective the move is supposed to be is "how feasible are those options on the list?" In other words, if you can go aggro on someone who can't plausibly barricade themselves in, they can't choose that option (and therefore may be forced to cave).<br/><br/>As for your general question, there are many, many games coming out of the "Forge era" which did what you're describing here very explicitly. <i>Sorcerer</i> may have been first (although it might not be exactly what you're looking for), but anything from <i>Shock:</i> to <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, and various explicit stake-setting games do that a lot.<br/><br/>For an easy, free example, look at the optional conflict rules in my game <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20513/thus-began-the-adventures-of-eowyn" rel="nofollow">Thus began the adventures of Eowyn...</a>.

It handles conflicts the way Capes did (/does?). And I really like it !<br/><br/>If I take your example :<br/>"You want to convince the goblin king to help you, and he wants his court jester to pick your pocket while you're negotiating,"<br/>Is there a prior relation between the two goals ? Must it be stated beforehand ? Do you want the players to have an interest in weaving this relation ? Are the positions of the players clear in the conflict (like Alice is the Jester Bob is the King and Clare is the negotiator ? or is Alice playing two sides ? or is Alice the GM opposing Bob the player with Charlie the player trying to pick sides ?) ?<br/><br/>I suggest to do it like this : <br/>1 - "Will you convince the goblin king to help you ?" <br/>and<br/>2 - "Will the Goblin King steal your Unobtainium seal ?" <br/><br/>First, it makes it clear to everyone the pickpocketing bit is just instrumental.<br/>(Play a few round of this and you will be careful what you wish for. It makes the Agendas stand out very quickly. And the intents, too.)<br/>(also it doesn't matter much who wants what : one player can support both answers to both questions and manage something for himself - on top of getting nicknamed littlefing*r)<br/><br/>Most of all, counter intuitive as it may be, stating <b>goals</b> in a YES/NO fashion opens the game to an infinite number of finesses. <br/>In fact, I would like to know how others handle "You want to convince the goblin king to help you, and he wants his court jester to pick your pocket while you're negotiating,". quia non placet : Because the difficulty of creating a scale of pickpocket skill-conditions-detection-prevention vs King help  will ensure you never think too much about it in actual play. Not that it is bad, but... there goes the promises of infinite finesse. <br/><br/>Whereas when you define goals with YES/NO questions, you establish them as discrete signs (benday dots in a picture, words in a sentence) and let players "do the meaning".<br/><br/>In my game I imitated the game of go "1 stone at a time" for pacing tension buildup drop by drop (adding "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_the_Bacon" rel="nofollow">instant sprint key moves</a>" dependent on fictional positioning conditions). I think this is perfect for threats-based negotiation. But you can use the same mechanism with different paces.<br/><br/>Of course, we now have a problem : the "conflict" you speak of is not represented mechanically. What you have is various questions.

I believe that TSOY uses similar language to what I'm trying here, and I would like critiques.<br/><br/>(Note to self: need a better description for resolution mechanics involving the two forms of intent. "Parallel intents" and "perpendicular intents" are too wordy. Thinking of "contests" for perpendicular intents, as the resolution is contested by another, but uncertain for parallel intents.)<br/><br/><i>Intents come in two varieties. There are parallel intents, which are intents that are not directly opposed to one another. Two trains running in parallel won't ever crash into one another, even if one's headed due east and the other is due west. Parallel intents are the same way. They exist alongside one another, and they do not restrict or directly inhibit the other, allowing both to occur in tandem. An example this phenomenon would be your desire to persuade the goblin king to aide you while the goblin king wishes to distract you long enough for his court jester to snatch away the magic torc hidden on your person. The king humors you with an audience, and you may be able to convince him, and his court jester may be able to filch the torc. You can succeed on your intent <i>and</i> the king can succeed on his.<br/><br/>The contrast of parallel intents is perpendicular intents. Perpendicular intents restrict or inhibit, and so like a train running north and a train running east, the two will collide, leaving one derailed and the other chugging along. Using a slight modification of the example above, a scenario of perpendicular intents would be your desire to persuade the goblin king to aide you while his vizier counsels him against this. The king humors you with an audience, and you may be able to convince him, or his vizier may be able to convince him. You and the vizier cannot both succeed on your respective intents because they're in direct opposition to one another.<br/><br/>Another difference between parallel and perpendicular intents is that parallel intents require active participants pursuing their goals. Perpendicular intents do not. In the case of you, the goblin king, and his sneaky court jester, you and the king are the primary participants (the court jester is acting in a lesser capacity because the king is doing the heavy lifting of distracting you). In the case of you, the king, and the vizier, there are again active participants butting heads. However, consider a third scenario.<br/><br/>Suppose you are a ne'er-do-well and cutpurse who wants to pay the goblin king to aide you. Negotiations are a lot of work, and money speaks louder than words. You notice a noble perusing the marketplace, purse plump with gold and silver. You figure this will cover the goblin king's expenses, so you make your move, seeking to liberate this individual from his earthly goods. While you're doing this, the noble is oblivious. He just wants to buy a fresh apple. However, even though he is unaware of your unscrupulous activities, he still has an intent perpendicular to yours: "I don't want you to steal my money." In this case, the noble is opposing your actions passively. He doesn't need to be actively watching for thieves. To resolve your intent of "steal the purse" with the noble's subconscious intent of "don't let anyone steal my purse" is an example of direct (albeit passive) opposition...and thus it is a case of perpendicular intent.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470015/#Comment_470015" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-15T17:45:22+00:00" title="February 15, 2018  5:45PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "opposed" and "independent" cover your two intent types in more accessible language.<br/><br/>"Opposed" and "orthogonal" are already in use for this purpose in some places.<br/><br/>I like your distinction between active and passive intents.  Though I'm not sure if "passive" is the most useful conception.  The noble is actively doing <i>something</i> to avoid getting robbed -- wearing his purse like so, glancing around from time to time, etc. -- it just isn't his conscious focus.  Maybe "routine" or "unconscious" is more accurate than "passive"?<br/><br/>I also wonder: could two passive/routine intents ever come into conflict?

I understand that Apocalypse World has the stakes implicitly set by hard moves, the fiction, and the move itself, but I (personally) enjoy setting the stakes before each roll because it allows me to telegraph risk, reward, and potential outcomes without relying on anything behind the curtain. For instance, from a D&amp;D game I ran, I said, "So-and-so, you could leap onto the creature's back from your vantage point and spear it, taking advantage on the attack roll and doing +2d6 damage. If you fail, you're going to take 3d6 falling damage."<br/><br/>He failed and suffered the hit point loss in stride, but suppose I had rolled an exceptionally well on that damage and knocked his character unconscious or slain him outright (unlikely, but possible). I would have perceived my own actions as unfair. By granting players foreknowledge of potential outcomes, I perceive my rulings as less arbitrary and more impartial. In addition to these perceptions (accurate or not though they may be), it promotes "hygienic" gameplay on my behalf and forces me to consider the consequences of a particular roll in advance. This naturally cultivates a gaming environment in which rolls are not thoughtlessly demanded out of force of habit.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> that sounds fascinating and similar to something I was considering.

The +2d6 damage was enough damage that it equated with an extra attack at that level, so I considered it a sufficient incentive to get him to take the risk.

Certainly one could represent the plot of <i>A New Hope</i> with a single roll of the dice (the Rebel Alliance wishes to Go Aggro on the Death Star, one might reason), but that would be a bowl of watery soup. Even at the very end of the movie, when Luke is about to destroy the Death Star, do we want that entire scene to play out in a single roll? No, I think the majority of players want to play out shooting down Tie Fighters and dodging laser fire.<br/><br/>How does one represent these scenes and conflicts in a way that is mechanically satisfying while producing an appropriate pace of resolution? I desire rules that reflect an appropriate narrative lens while at the same time providing sufficient structure that one isn't left rolling dice too often or too seldom. An impossible goal, I suspect, but to return to <i>A New Hope</i>: how many times does Luke have to Act Under Fire when piloting to the Death Star's exhaust port?<br/><br/>Luke #1: I want to pilot into position to fire the proton torpedo into the exhaust port.<br/><br/>MC #1: There is laser fire all around you, and two Tie Fighters are closing in on you.

Hmm.  That seems fundamentally at odds with orthogonal/parallel rolling to me.  Why would one roll resolve two agents' intents but not the full interplay between them?  For granular advancement of the situation and resolution of small-scale intents, I'd be inclined to roll separately for separate parties.<br/><br/>If you wanted, though, I imagine you could just keep tight reins on the scope/duration of whoever's intents are being resolved by a given roll.  Like, the GM has to describe what the NPC is up to on the same scale as the PC who triggered the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470156/#Comment_470156" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-22T02:31:08+00:00" title="February 22, 2018  2:31AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many games very successfully leave the *scope* of resolution open, for the group to fine-tune to their tastes.<br/><br/>Even <i>Apocalypse World</i> does this, though within certain parameters.
