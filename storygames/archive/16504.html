I'm thinking of publishing one of my rulesets, along with a print-and-tape-it-yourself battle mat. But I'm curious to see what other indie designers have done, in terms of game texts.<br/><br/>Naturally, I'm going to be hitting up places like DTRPG, but I'd love it if someone could point me at some cool indie minis games. If you got something, now's your chance to pimp it to me, whether it's a free PDF or something you're selling, or whatever. Consider me interested. Especially if <b>you</b> wrote it, and can answer questions about it.<br/><br/>Because even though I've been doing homebrew minis stuff for years, I recently realized that I've never actually read a core rulebook for any minature-based war games. Which is kind of weird. Time to remedy that!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378023/#Comment_378023" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T21:31:06+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  9:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure how much of an 'indie' minis scene exists, in the way we here might think of it. You've got a few major manufacturers, who make the minis and the rules that they support, then you've got a pile of smaller rules publishers and mini manufacturers. Sometimes those overlap, sometimes not. But there's often not much conceptual difference between the big and small writers. The big guys - Warhammer FB/40K, Warmachine/Hordes, Flames of War - tend towards simplicity and tournament-balance armies. The little guys tends towards 'use what you have/like' and some rules innovation. But in my experience, the difference between those is significantly less than the difference between, say, Champions and Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>Here's some links to free rules you might want to check out:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.infinitythegame.com/infinity/en/" rel="nofollow">Infinity.</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/" rel="nofollow">Two Hour Wargames.</a> Check their 'FREE!' section for 'Chain Reaction 3.0.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/miniatures/judge-dredd/rulebook.html" rel="nofollow">Judge Dredd Miniatures Rules.</a><br/><br/>To understand how those are different (or not, in some aspects) from the 'big guys', I encourage you to find/borrow/whatever a copy of Warhammer 40K, Warmachine or Flames of War, recent editions, and peruse those as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378027/#Comment_378027" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T22:23:32+00:00" title="May 12, 2012 10:23PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are  you kidding?

A number of those sites I mentioned, or their yahoo groups (including the 2Hour wargames guys that Noah D mentioned) are great places to make online contact.<br/><br/>One thing I have noticed about indie minis games compared to indie SGs/RPGs: Indie rpgs, especially those associated with/talked about on sites like this have really developed a cultural attitude that is very good about describing not just the mechanics of the games, but also one of explaining very well the intent of how the game is meant to be played.<br/><br/>Many times, indie minis games just give you the mechanics part, and are a bit short on the How is this Meant to be Played part. You need to do a bit of questioning to get to that second half, but it can be terribly enlightening when you do. It's almost as if the indie minis scene is still a bit stuck in the mindset it was in when D&amp;D 0e was released. If you were ib the know with folks close to the designes you had one impression. The further you were removed from that, the more you might actually drift the intent a great deal without realizing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378058/#Comment_378058" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T06:34:06+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  6:34AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in the process of building an RPG that is very focused on a core ruleset for miniatures combat (very old school in this sense, though not in others).

When I was thinking 'mainstream wargames' I was thinking of the problem that WH40K has now, in that it is, depending on where and with whom you play, 'Marinehammer'. Everyone plays Space Marines, the stalwart defenders of humanity. So...why are they fighting each other? For the most part, the players don't care. There's no story, there's just the tactical challenges. When I was thinking 'indie/story wargames', I had in mind Two Hour Wargames, where some of their stuff really is RPG-lite with minis.<br/><br/>Kidding, no.

Even the Games Workshop games that are more gang warfafre level seem to be more like that.<br/><br/>Strange Aeons is another one that seems to go in that direction. The " Chaos in Carpathia/...Cairo/ etc" series from Blue Moon also. Don't know those ones personally, but have been reading threads on them elsewhere.<br/><br/>They are the sorts of games I was thinking of though when I was talking about folks writing a bit incoherently where getting the message of "How I intend for you to play, if ya wanna play like I do" comes in.<br/><br/>Howard Whitehouse's games, for example, are ones where you're vastly better off reading the advice type stuff that you are reading the rules mechanics. From asking questions of Howard and other folks on his Astounding Tales! yahoo group, his games are super, double-plus RPGish. (I'm thinking of his Astounding Tales! pulp rules in particular, but also his Victorian era Sudan War game)<br/><br/>You wouldn't necessarily get that from the rulesbook, though. In fact, I got more info on how he plays from AP reports and questons at the yahoo group, that I think anyone could gleen from going over the purchased rulebook, at least for core important concepts of how to run a game.<br/><br/> I think sometimes that the behaviors/playstyles in minis games that are more story game or rpg like aren't seen as often by folks because you kinda have to get out to conventions to see them, and you really need to look around for the people putting on certain kinds of small company or homebrew rules based games.<br/><br/>There's still a lot of<i> "legacy rules" think </i>in the actual written dcuments for those games. IT's a little bit like watching folks in the RPG community trying to pound a sqaure peg design into a round hole for ages and ages, while not realizing there's a community of other folks who've already kinda taken up the banner of designing mechanics towards your core concept/style of play.<br/><br/>Taking up that banner may well mean abandoning certain much-loved legacy mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378167/#Comment_378167" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T05:53:44+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  5:53AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We Can Be Heroes designed and published by Gordon Roach has got some RPG elements - or should I say potential.

I got around costly production with my own game BigBigBattles by having simple yet attractive paper craft models players can download and print out. <br/><br/>I self published my game BigBigBattles a few years ago and it had some great success (nothing that paid the bills but it was a very important step in my career).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378292/#Comment_378292" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T15:59:54+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  3:59PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh if you want to see some masterful rulebook writing check out axis&amp;allies war at see revised 2 player starter set. that is a very clean and well produced rule book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378381/#Comment_378381" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T06:53:11+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  6:53AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pedyo</cite>We Can Be Heroes designed and published by Gordon Roach has got some RPG elements - or should I say potential.
