The petition closed in February, it got 650 signatures, and since then I have been trying to get Wizards to give a response to the petition.<br/><br/>I made contact with Wizards' PR guy John Leroy in April. The fact that the only public contact point with Wizards is a PR company didn't exactly fill me with hope, and unfortunately my fears turned out to be justified. After asking me to send him the petition, John entered radio silence. I've chased him every few weeks since I sent him the petition, and he has failed to reply (and yes, I did check my spam box).  I darkly suspect that the petition never made it past the PR department.<br/><br/>I think that when hundreds of your customers tell you they want something you should at least give them a respectful response. Ignoring them outright - well, let's say I'm not impressed. I don't necessarily expect them to change their art policy (though obviously I want them to) but to ignore the petition outright shows a lack of respect.<br/><br/>I would encourage those who signed the petition (or anyone who thinks they ought to reply) to contact John Leroy at 360 degrees PR. His email address is jleroy@360pr.com. (Note that this is a corporate address, not a personal address; I would never share a personal email address in this way.) Alternatively you could tweet them at <a href="/forums/profile/360pr">@360pr</a>, perhaps including Wizards customer service <a href="/forums/profile/Wizards_CS">@Wizards_CS</a>. Let them know your views.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Rabalias                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418729/#Comment_418729" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-20T11:24:10+00:00" title="July 20, 2013 11:24AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, I'm not seeking to re-open discussion on the petition issue. If you want to discuss D&amp;D's art that's fine - but the original thread is probably the best place for that. This thread is for discussion of Wizards' lack of response.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418748/#Comment_418748" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-21T03:35:34+00:00" title="July 21, 2013  3:35AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With my professional hat on, petitions are always a low impact method of campaigning. You need thousands of signatures before it makes an impact. Generally they serve two purposes: the build a mailing list and to get media interest. The fact that you have not had a response yet suggests that it's time to engage the media (confession: I have no idea what the main media sources for D&amp;D players is) and scale up your campaign.<br/><br/>I would getting as many people as possible to write in at this point, not just tweet, and while people should write with reference to the petition, you should be getting people to deal with the substantive points in the letter as well.<br/><br/>In terms of social media, by all means tweet at them, but the main value of social media for you is to connect yourself with other people who agree with the issue. Try targeting high profile D&amp;D fans, Vin Diesel perhaps, and attempt to get him on board. Look at curating services such as Storify to try to dramatise the issue. And of course any facts and figures you have to hand you should turn into a shareable infographic.<br/><br/>Finally, you should be trying to find them in places where they are more accessible, such as cons, and lobbying them directly there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
