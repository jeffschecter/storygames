I already placed a link to the current draft in one of the threads here, but I'd be happy if I could get some more eyeballs on it before I make it completely public.  Here's the link:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.berengad.com/public/beasthunters_demo.pdf" rel="nofollow">Beast Hunters Demo 1.0</a><br/><br/>The demo contains the complete conflict resolution rules, instructions on how to run the game, a prepared challenge with map, secondary goals and four threats, four premade characters, and a summary rules sheet. It can be played by up to 5 players (including the Challenger) and at Go Play NW fit almost perfectly into a 3 hour slot with that many players involved.<br/><br/>I'm probably going to add a little snippet about who gets to narrate what, and about killing off individual members of a big group in narration. Aside from that, from the feedback I received from the people who played the game at Go Play NW, it seems to be complete.<br/><br/>However, the reason I'm asking for feedback here is that I'd be glad if people who haven't played the game nor read the book could look it over and see if there are any questions left open that they'd need answered in order to play the demo.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80533/#Comment_80533" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T00:04:04+00:00" title="July 11, 2007 12:04AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2007 5:43PM by johnzo.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played the BH demo tonight with Wil, Seth, and Mike, three players from my regular Tuesday night WFRP / SotC group.    I was the Challenger.  Seth and Mike are veterans in the hobby game biz; both of them work for a big Seattle-area game company.   Wil is 'rafial' here.  He's a big fan of Tunnels and Trolls and knows how to step on up.  None of them had played BH before, though Wil owns the game and has read it.<br/><br/>Actual play started a bit slowly but ramped up as people got their brains running.  <br/><br/>Wil, playing Olor, set himself up in the drowned forest and faced off against the Saula Miur captain and his bodyguards.  And who should be among the villains but the betrayer, Harik?  Olor treed the quailing captain, then lept up after him and threw him down upon the pursuing Harik's sword.  Then he demanded that Harik return with him for trial.  Head bowed, Harik obeyed -- but later, Olor and Harik came upon the retreating remnants of the Saula Muir phalanx, and Olor told Harik he could retain his honor if he helped kill them.  Harik struck the decisive blow, renounced the softling ways of the Saula Muir, and came back to his people. <br/><br/>Mike was Nioqhe.  He set up at the temple and faced the dogs.  Half the dogs trapped Nioqhe's Chel'qhuri warriors up against a deep, open cellar next to the temple, while the other half rooted the tribal children from their sanctuary and ate them.  Seeing this made Nioqhe's more Beast than Hunter.  He used a prepared net to ensnare the torchmen who were about to destroy the camp, lured the Saula Muir phalanx into a close quarter scrum, and then <b>chewed</b> his way out from the bottom of the pile.  He broke the phalanx and then herded its remants into the trap set by Harik and Olor.<br/><br/>Seth was Iaqhari.  He based himself on the plain and faced the phalanx of soldiers.  He set the early tone.  Using his men as a diversion, he slid through the mud under the upraised spears of the phalanx and into their midst, where he attacked their sergeant.  The sergeant urged the phalanx to continue on its way while he fought Iaqhari one-on-one.  The sergeant got into trouble and would have died were it  not for a late-arriving giant, who fell quickly to Iaqhari's sword, and landed directly on top of the unfortunate Chel'qhuri warrior.  The sergeant and Iaqhari dueled for the rest of the demo, until soldiers fleeing the carnage that Nioqhe inflicted upon the phalanx ran by, breaking the sergeant's morale.<br/><br/>In the end, the Chelq'huri won a great victory, running off the attackers without suffering a single wound -- perhaps I was too generous with the advantage points -- although I did kill the children with the dogs.  This infuriated the players and touched off a race for them to fulfill all the other secondary goals. In the end, despite the roll-over of my foes, everyone agreed they'd had fun, and that they'd like to try out a multiplayer campaign version of BH.  Wil and I are going to try some proper one-on-one to find out how it plays that way.  <br/><br/>I'm thinking of applying the Nixon Principle and putting up a Jedi Hunter version of BH at the upcoming Dragonflight con.  Players would be Sith assassins responsible for hunting down rogue Jedi.  The way I see it, much of the joy of BH is narrating fun surroundings into existence and then using them to put the hurt on your enemies.  I'd like to see what happens when you have the fun and very-well-known surroundings of the Star Wars universe to play with.  I'll probably also run a vanilla demo of Beast Hunters just to keep the light and dark sides balanced.<br/><br/>(continued...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80534/#Comment_80534" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T00:04:26+00:00" title="July 11, 2007 12:04AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2007 4:58PM by johnzo.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some notes for Christian:<br/><br/>* I followed your recipe for presenting the game pretty precisely, although I allowed the players to select characters  before I explained the rules.  I figured it would be easier to explain things if the players had character sheets in front of them.  I told them that the choice of characters wasn't that important, mechanically -- what was important was that they dug the style of the traits, and everyone seemed to buy that.<br/><br/>* When I hit the salute-in part, I wanted to make it optional, but Wil prompted us to go ahead, so we did.  I would have been okay forgoing this, because I've known and gamed with these guys for quite some time now and our boundaries and trust are, as far as I know, cool.  Tho I thought the salute was totally useful in our GPNW game, where I didn't know any of the participants.<br/><br/>* We stumbled over pronunciation of the weird (to us) qh consonant pair and the long strings of vowels. A pronunciation guide might be a good idea.<br/><br/>* It'd be keen if the character sheets included separate lines for tracking advantage points vs. different foes, like the foes sheet does.<br/><br/>* I allowed incapacitating damage, and I think it improved the demo.  It shortened things to a comfortable length and allowed for narrations that didn't involve utter killing defeat.  One of these turned out really nicely -- the Harik one.  I think BH is ably demonstrated with incapacitating rules intact; both times I've played this demo the Chel'qhuri have handily defeated the Saula Muir, and at a certain point it became a foregone conclusion.  When the overall outcome is not in doubt and all the secondaries have been checked, a bit of drama leaks out and play probably shouldn't proceed beyond that point.  With three players, we took about 2:15 to explain and play the scenario, and I think that's a very comfortable length for the amount of game you get in the BH demo.<br/><br/>*  It might be a good idea to de-emphasize the social and mental traits; either take them off the sheet or print them faintly.  They don't add a lot to the demo except for confusion.  Some of them are easily mistaken for good physical challenge traits, like Iaqhari's Natural Leader -- in this game, we were narrating Chel'qhuri soldiers in all over the place, so that could have been a speed bump if Seth had tried to activate it.<br/><br/>* The secondaries on the map sheet have an inconsistent point of view: "Kidnap Tribal Children" is a Saula Muir goal, whereas "Reveal Traitor" is a Chel'qhuri goal.  I think they should all be written from the Chel'qhuri perspective -- suggest adding "Prevent" in front of the Kidnap, Kill, and Burn goals.<br/><br/>* My players wedged a trait activation into their scene-setting.  I was happy that they got the trait-activation business, so I didn't stop them and correct them.  I gave the Saula Muir a similar scene-setting, where I put a Saula Muir unit into place against each Hunter and activated a trait for each of them.<br/><br/>* Some graphical way on the character sheets of noting that traits = maneuvers and resources = strikes would be cool.<br/><br/>* Mike (Nioqhe) spent the AP to save the chief, but he didn't have his character act on that.  Instead, he narrated a scene of the chief defeating some assassins (not the assassins unit, just some plain old bad guy assassins that he'd narrated into existence) in the highest spire of the temple and showing their heads to the Saula Muir.  At first, I wanted to disallow this because Nioque hadn't participated in the action, but I didn't, because hey, cool narration!  I was unsure if this was okay by the rules.<br/><br/>* I gave everyone instructions that they could happily narrate surrounding scenery into existence, and everyone cottoned to this.  I am not sure if this is an official part of the demo.<br/><br/>* I followed the official guidelines for AP awards, giving away diff +4 for good, diff+8 for excellent, and diff+12 for awesome.  This was enough advantage points for my guys to slaughter everything.  I was often thinking, should I calibrate my rewards so that they fall in the 4-6 area, where the players will be tempted to gamble on a roll?  Gambling is exciting! Or do I strictly want to reward awesomeness and let the gambling happen with the weaker narrations?  I went for the awesomeness and I think the play was better than if I'd focused on gambling.  Gambling has the risk that your cool narration will evaporate.<br/><br/>* There's a significant whiff factor in the strike rolls, especially at the 3d10 level.  We had two 3d10s do just heavy damage and fail to be decisive.  This was a bit of a bummer.  I thought about what a larger number of smaller dice might look like on a strike chart--something with a bigger middle to its bell  .. something like alternating d4s and d6s.<br/><br/>* Denying and recovering resources didn't come up once.  I don't think this scenario rewards it at all.  Take away some of the Hunters' backup weapons, like Kelhka's sword, and this might come up more often.<br/><br/>* Olor, with a +7 defensive trait bonus once she's all activated, is nigh-invincible.  Since the Challenger can't narrate advantage point awards, it took me all night to find the kind dice and build up a reasonable (21) AP total on her.  Mind you, I was rolling terribly, too.<br/><br/>* We played with the AP-transferring rules from the BH game, and it really sped the endgame.  I suggest adding these to the demo.<br/><br/>* The plain is less exciting than the other locales.  A lot of BH comes down to the surroundings, and Seth moved into the drowned forest as soon as he could, seemingly just so he could get some terrain to play with.<br/><br/>There's lots of fiddly comments here, but the bottom line was that this was fun.

Both times it happened, I was happy with it -- although in the first case, when I transferred AP between Saula Muir units, I just narrated some stuff I liked and moved the points.

I'm really glad you guys had fun, and those actions and the resulting story sound great.<br/><br/>Wil, The challenge itself is not a tough one, because I figured that as a first exposure to the game, players might struggle a bit to hit their stride and really make use of the mechanics. But given that you know the game and that stepping up is a play style you're intimately familiar with, it's probably a bit too easy for you.
