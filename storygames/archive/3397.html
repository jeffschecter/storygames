It should have the customization that's fun for an individual player, but the "fun for everyone" dynamic that comes from group character creation in Best Friends and Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/><b>Inspiration:</b> The current discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3346&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">class-based character creation</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3383&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">improv-inspired resolution cards</a>. In the former thread, Andy K noted that the Japanese Final Fantasy inspired RPG <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alshard" rel="nofollow">Alshard</a> encourages multiclassing with simple experience tracks and other cool fiddly bits.  Fred Hicks' <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/lab/schizonauts-game-chef-edition.zip" rel="nofollow">Schizonauts</a> design notes have once again made it all too evident that an RPG should have core game mechanics that are fun in and of themselves. Damned if it wasn't one hell of a coincidence that right when Fred turned me on to that truism, I was also listening to Paul Tevis' description of the <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/havegameswilltravel/hgwt91.mp3" rel="nofollow">card-drafting mechanics</a> in the board game Notre Dame (Look for it at the 7:07 mark).<br/><br/><b>Idea:</b> Let's say a game has a list of "classes," but more like the Keys in TSOY, the Roles in octaNe or the Adept Schools in Unknown Armies. In other words, each "class" is simply a set of mechanically encouraged in-game behaviors. Each class is printed on a card and all the cards are in a deck at the center of the table. \n<blockquote>Draw three cards out of the deck. Keep the card you'd like to play this session, pass the remaining two to the player on your left and get two cards from the player on your right. Select one of those two cards to play, pass the remaining one card to the player on your left and receive one from the player on your right. After this, you should have three archetype cards, only one of which were from your hand.</blockquote>\n<b>Alternative:</b> I'm also curious about characters actually being comprised of their own customized deck of cards, but only a few of those cards being relevant in a particular session.\n<blockquote>Choose one card that you want to keep and play that session. Hand two other cards to each player. Those players choose which one they'd like to see in play, handing it back to you, and which they would not, discarding it to another area of the table. The remaining cards are your characters "stats" for that session.<br/><br/>For example, Iron Man's deck might contain "rich," "smart," "alcoholic," "wears power armor," "is a member of a super team," and "self-absorbed." But through a process of card-drafting, the group decides that only the "rich," "wears power armor," and "alcoholic" cards are relevant for that evening's story. </blockquote>\nWhat I like about <i>this</i> system is that the card-drafting process becomes a metaphor for the "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1341&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">I want to learn X from Y</a>" structure I posted about many moons ago.<br/><br/><b>Analysis:</b> In theory, both methods combine Best Friends' group character creation, the modular archetypes of Alshard, the card drafting mechanics of a CCG, the Keys of TSOY, and the "audience suggestion" dynamic of an improv game.<br/><br/>Someone konk me on the head if I'm completely off here. Lately, I've been posting random mechanical ideas that have been already-done, so I suspect that might be the case for this concept as well. :P                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

You could create card "sets" such as phobias, secret loves, etc. In any given session, you might require each player to use at least one card from a given set or <i>not</i> use cards from a given set. This could help direct play down certain avenues for that session. E.g., "Let's deal with phobias tonight; everyone has to include a phobia card!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76781/#Comment_76781" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T09:05:33+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  9:05AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

Perhaps when they pull key phrases from the letter, they write 'em down on index cards and shuffle them together, then the group uses a card-drafting method to create the antagonists and supporting characters that the group will be facing together.<br/><br/>Back to the character creation, though: I worry about creating too many categories and sub-categories. That, to me, is one of the weaknesses of CCGs. I would hope to create "classes" that are succinct and descriptive enough on their own that you'd know intuitively that a particular card ("brutal misogynist") wouldn't be appropriate for a game session ("Adventures in Candyland").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76782/#Comment_76782" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T09:11:04+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  9:11AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i liked this idea a lot when i saw it in your LJ this morning.

The game represents a fight between them.  There's no hand; The decks are drawn from to see what happens in a given exchange.  The decks are principally composed of "An Action Your Character Takes," along with some "A Person Who Helps Your Character" and "A Condition Favorable to Your Character, and/or Detrimental to Your Opponent."  Cards are also drawn/discarded to pay the cost of whatever card you play.   <br/><br/>I suppose I've just listed almost every aspect of the game which I think might be relevant to your first alternative.  I might be suffering from New Toy Syndrome, but it seems like a system ripe for story-a-tizing.  All you'd have to do is make a big set of generic cards that can be selected from when making a character deck, designing them to inspire cool narration of arbitrary sorts of conflict (less "Knuckle Sandwich" and "Last Bullet," more "Calm and Collected" or "Painful Memories"). Let them be re-named depending on the character concept ("Mysterious Past" -&gt; "Abandoned in the Jungle", "Man of Science" -&gt; "Billionaire Inventor").  Include multiples of a given card to emphasize its importance in our view of the character, having four copies of "Alcohol-fueled Binge" just as you might have "Alcoholic: 4."  Cards also can influence the world/story/game, rather than just the character (Including "What has Science Wrought?!" doesn't necessarily mean your dude is a mad scientist, just that science-gone-wrong will be an occasional occurence).  The GM could have his own deck for a given adventure, plus maybe small sets of cards for antagonists, plus maybe required cards in the player's decks to shape the range of their actions.  You could let part of each player's deck be determined by the other players, like you suggest.<br/><br/>This sounds odd enough that I think I'm going to try it.  I bet I could at least make a small Roaring 20's set by just renaming cards after the sample aspects from <i>SotC</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76843/#Comment_76843" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T15:23:45+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  3:23PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very cool. Dammit, Solis, you've now got me thinking about doing this for the Pentasystem, and I do not need another rewrite!<br/><br/>(But I do need a quick-build way of introducing new NPC-equivalents. Hmmmm....)<br/><br/>I did playing-card-draw-based character creation systems for both <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Errantry.pdf" rel="nofollow">Errantry</a> and <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/files/City%20of%20Masks%20Storygame.pdf" rel="nofollow">City of Masks</a>. In Errantry, you start out with a pack of cards split into court and non-court cards. When an NPC shows up, you draw a court card (the Encounter card) and two non-court cards, noting their order; this tells you what kind of character you have met, from a lookup table with 100 entries. The suits of the three cards and the denomination of the Encounter card combine to tell you their pool levels, abilities, Secrets and a Key (it's TSOY-based); the character sheet is marked so that you are basically ticking boxes, and it's obvious which ones to tick based on the three cards you drew.<br/><br/>City of Masks is simpler; there are a set of archetypes, one assigned to each card, and they give you half-gen characters which you then fill out further.<br/><br/>The advantage of using standard playing cards is that pretty much everyone has a set, so you don't need to do any fancy printing and cutting up. The disadvantage, of course, is that you have to interpret them; they don't have their meaning already written on them, so you need some kind of lookup.<br/><br/>This is a great idea, Daniel, and I'll be watching with interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76879/#Comment_76879" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T02:53:14+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  2:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm noticing the same issue with playing cards myself, which is why I'm leaning towards a short list of maybe 10-20 "classes" that can be quickly written on index cards rather than trying expand the list to 52 archetypes so that each matches to a playing card.

I like the double-meaning of the word "suit" there. As if there are 13 archetypes, but they <i>wear</i> one of four suits. Cute. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm still not sold on the use of a full playing card deck, but let's examine this idea out loud.<br/><br/>If I had some sort of thematic mnemonic device tacked on to the suits, that would help in the development immensely. Off the top of my head, each suit could correspond with an element: Fire, Earth, Wind, Water. Those elements suggest certain "shades," roughly corresponding to force, resilience, finesse and, um, er, adaptation(?) I'm not at all married to this structure, but let's just go with that for the sake of examination.<br/><br/>Using D&amp;D as a generic example:\n<blockquote>The Ace card is <i>the Fighter</i>.<br/><br/>Ace of Clubs is a force-style fighter: <i>The Berserker</i><br/>The Berserker is rewarded for being violent. <br/><br/>Ace of Diamonds is a resilience-style fighter: <i>The Tank</i><br/>The Tank rewarded for "taking one for the team."<br/><br/>Ace of Spades is a finesse-style fighter: <i>The Swashbuckler</i><br/>The Swashbuckler is rewarded for doing fancy moves.<br/><br/>Ace of Hearts is a adaptation-style fighter: <i>The Martial Artist</i><br/>The Martial Artist is rewarded for improvising.</blockquote>\nRepeat 13 times. My brain trembles. I wonder if isn't <i>just</i> the suits that need a mnemonic device, but also the classes themselves. The classes could correspond to a horoscope of some sort. Is there a 13-sign horoscope? I might have to make one up or just remove the Aces from the deck so there are 12 classes.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you could take attributes of an archetype and split them across the four suits. If you put all four suits of "The Fighter" together, you'd have the complete "Fighter", but more likely you'll have "The Finesse of a Fighter," "The Force of a Wizard," "The Resilience of a Cleric," and so on. I think I'd prefer this option if I were to use a playing-card-based system.<br/><br/>Even if I <i>don'</i>t use the cards themselves, they certainly provide a useful skeleton around which to build the core list of "keys" for Do. All I gotta do is come up with 13 personality archetypes, probably inspired by characters from Avatar: the Last Airbender. Then, figure out four attribute-categories to correspond with the suits that are generic enough that I'd be able to tease out a Key for each combination of archetype+suit.

In the game, your character consists of three cards.  One is the character's crew position or distinctive role (The Captain, The Dirty Foreigner, The Surgeon, The Cook, etc), and the other two are valuable objects the character happens to possess.  At the beginning of the game, players draw pairs of cards of each type and choose one to keep.  Most of the role-cards have special rules that apply to that character (not all of them good), and the objects usually have one significant effect that can happen once or a milder effect that can happen any number of times.  Finally, there's also a deck of event-cards like those of the <i>Roach</i>.<br/><br/>There.  I've done my due diligence in the intelligence-sharing process.<br/><br/>I find all of the mutually-contradictory ideas brought up so far nifty keen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76921/#Comment_76921" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T09:17:58+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  9:17AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, Jason...

You draw a card, look up what class it corresponds to, and then presumably copy over the abilities from the book to a piece of paper / character sheet.

No playing cards! I got it. ^_^<br/><br/>The Board Game Designer's Forum has a very <a href="http://www.bgdf.com/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Card%20Drafting" rel="nofollow">concise analysis</a> of card-drafting mechanics:\n<blockquote>A game mechanic in which a selection of options (often cards, but occasionally tiles) are available to the player. These options may be steadily diminishing (Citadels) or continuously refreshed (Alhambra.) One interesting division within this mechanic is whether the drafting is done openly (the cards are laid out face-up and everyone knows what you took) or secretly (the cards are passed along from player to player, with each player usually selecting one of the cards.) A middle option, where players can draft from an open line or take an unknown card is also fairly common (Ticket to Ride or China.)<br/><br/><br/>How this mechanic can be used:<br/><br/>    * Within a fixed card-pool, this can be an interesting way of distributing the cards in a less random fashion than simply shuffling.<br/>    * To add a level of tactical choice to a game that would otherwise lack it. For instance, variants of Carcassonne in which players get to choose one from three tiles, instead of simply randomly drawing one. <br/><br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>    * An excellent way of introducing information-giving: the player is aware that by selecting a particular card they are indicating a certain preference without being allowed to talk about it. In a closed drafting environment (e.g. Magic: the Gathering), this can be extremely subtly handled both at a design level and a playing level.<br/><br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>    * It will slow the game down, even without the element of analysis paralysis introduced, as there is usually a minor upkeep element involved in creating or maintaining the display, as compared with shuffling and dealing. </blockquote>\nThat mention of analysis paralysis worries me a bit, but I think this summary presumes that the drafting will happen in the middle of play rather than as a prep phase.<br/><br/>I hadn't considered the possibilities for "open" or "secret" drafting. I can see the fun in both. Open drafts make it more of a group activity. Secret drafts lead to fun reveals in the middle of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76942/#Comment_76942" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T11:22:53+00:00" title="June 21, 2007 11:22AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey I'm in favor of playing cards.

That's probably a subject for another time though. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76985/#Comment_76985" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T15:57:32+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  3:57PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2007 3:58PM by DanielSolis.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike: Thanks for the links! I'm <i>so</i> keeping those in mind. To tell you the truth, I hadn't thought about how this would be produced. I'd probably lay out the cards in the book so that you could xerox a page, cut it out and place into a card sleeve. You could keep a 3x3 card sleeve sheet as your character sheet, maybe. I think I remember Andy K talking about a Japanese RPG going this route. But, really, even <i>that</i> might be overkill if I only have a handful of archetypes that can be fairly easily recorded onto index cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77117/#Comment_77117" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T09:44:45+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  9:44AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2007 9:48AM by Kynn.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude!

Thing is, part of the reason I balked at playing cards is that there are <i>so many</i>. Mah Jong, while evocative, doesn't really help in that regard, y'know? Plus, they're less common than dice or generic tokens, and I generally try to use the cheapest, most ubiquitous game-props possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
