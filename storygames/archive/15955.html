Add two moves, something like this but without such terrible wording:<br/>\n<br/>\nDELAY: When you don't have anything you want to do, drop out of the initiative order.  You can jump back into the initiative order at any point, immediately after the person whose turn it is when you announce your return.<br/>\n<br/>\nREADY: When you don't have anything you want to do just yet, drop out of the initiative order and name a condition.  You can jump back into the initiative order whenever that condition occurs, immediately before the condition.  <br/>\n<br/>\n"I ready an action to shoot whoever comes through the door" thus goes off as someone is coming through the door.  If you delay, then when someone comes through the door you want to shoot them, they get to come all the way in and do whatever they're doing before you get to shoot them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played DW for literally the first time yesterday so I don't doubt there's some obvious flaw, but I'm curious as to what it is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362950/#Comment_362950" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T11:26:05+00:00" title="February 27, 2012 11:26AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2012 11:26AM by mease19.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When <b>the GM asks "what do you do?" and you don't want to act until you see what someone else does first</b>, you <b>defend</b> your position.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jeffwik" title="jeffwik"><img alt="jeffwik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jeffwik">jeffwik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362953/#Comment_362953" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T11:40:10+00:00" title="February 27, 2012 11:40AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...Sorry, I don't understand you.

It's been proposed before. However, I'm not convinced that it's EVER necessary to add new initiative rules to Dungeon World, so the question becomes "Why would you WANT to add an initative roll to Dungeon World?"<br/><br/>If the answer is "I really like initiative rolls," that's cool, you should roll some initiative then. On the other hand, if the answer is "Because I want to do THIS, and I can't do THIS without an initiative roll," then people will usually chime in and tell you how you can do THIS without an initiative roll.

The players say what the PCs do in response to the GM's descriptions and the ever present question "what do you do?" to do something in DW, you just do it. It's the GM's job to listen for moves and say "that sounds like Hack and Slash," or "why don't you roll to Defy Danger." Until a player says what they are doing, there's no way to know if they're being passive or active, or if they have a clear plan. There's no declaration phase where everyone announces intents and the GM can parse who has an opening and who doesn't, etc. The GM has no idea what the PC will do until they do it.<br/><br/>Implementing Simon's list would require a fundamental shift in the way the game plays.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363185/#Comment_363185" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T20:32:57+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  8:32PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>Implementing Simon's list would require a fundamental shift in the way the game plays.</blockquote>\nNot so fundamental, IMO.

That's where the guidelines could be useful.<br/><br/>Especially this one:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Those who have an opening go ahead of those who don't.</blockquote>\nSo, if I'm interpreting it correctly, when the Fighter is surrounded by zombies and trying to hang for dear life, but the Elf is standing up above, looking down at the fight and over at the giant statue in the corner, the GM/MC should describe and ask the Elf first, then the Fighter. <br/><br/>Moves snowball, right?

When I run DW, I usually fall into a predictable turn order. Sometimes I mix it up but I usually assume that everyone wants to go all the time and the only thing stopping chaos is the GMs gaze. I'm fans of all of the characters so I want to see them all do stuff.<br/><br/>That's not my favorite way for combats to go, but it works fine. You're spreading the spotlight around in a predictable order around the table and it runs smoothly that way. But, I've seen you run the game and you aren't applying any filters based on the character's passivity or planning to determine who goes next. You just apply your principles (make the world seem fantastical, make their lives interesting, be a fan, etc.). You're not, for example, trying to determine if the thief has a clear plan. You just say something like "Bilbo, the orc is running at you with a spear. What do you do?" The fictional positioning decisions are fully in the GM's hands.<br/><br/>And that's the thing. Initiative is only needed if the GM isn't doing his job of setting up the fictional position. "There are five orcs in the room. What is everyone doing?" Just leaving things there results in no one knowing whose turn it is. It's confusing and lazy, really. But, the GM has much more power than that in DW.

Things like favouring people who are following a plan or who have an opening is just a trick for encouraging players to prepare carefully for combats - to encourage the kind of Basic D&amp;D planning and stuff that I like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jeffwik" title="jeffwik"><img alt="jeffwik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jeffwik">jeffwik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363293/#Comment_363293" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T06:57:54+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  6:57AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 6:58AM by jeffwik.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>That's not my favorite way for combats to go, but it works fine. You're spreading the spotlight around in a predictable order around the table and it runs smoothly that way. But, I've seen you run the game and you aren't applying any filters based on the character's passivity or planning to determine who goes next. You just apply your principles (make the world seem fantastical, make their lives interesting, be a fan, etc.). You're not, for example, trying to determine if the thief has a clear plan. You just say something like "Bilbo, the orc is running at you with a spear. What do you do?" The fictional positioning decisions are fully in the GM's hands.<br/><br/>And that's the thing. Initiative is only needed if the GM isn't doing his job of setting up the fictional position. "There are five orcs in the room. What is everyone doing?" Just leaving things there results in no one knowing whose turn it is. It's confusing and lazy, really. But, the GM has much more power than that in DW. The GM can look at the Paladin and say "The largest orc rushes you with a murderous roar..." And then turn to the wizard and say "You see the Paladin go down to one knee in the mud of the dungeon floor..." And then turn to the thief and say "As the wizard's lightning bolt roasts the orc, you see a kobold creeping up on him..."</blockquote>\nWhile I'm not arguing for it (any more, anyways) it's still unclear to me how initiative is poisonous to DW.  What you're describing, turn order paladin to wizard to thief, doesn't look different to me than an initiative order.  Presumably after the thief responds to the kobold, it'll be time for the paladin to get some spotlight-time, and the decision to follow the paladin's actions with something for the wizard next as opposed to something for the thief first a) doesn't seem like a hugely significant one to me and b) could be handled within an initiative framework.  I'm honestly not seeing what the difference is -- certainly I wouldn't advocate for elaborate round-by-round roll-offs, or a simultaneous-resolution mechanic or anything crazy-go-nuts like that... but the system could be something as simple as "after A does something, B does something.  After B does something, C does something.  After C does something, A does something.  If C wants to act immediately after A, and if B agrees to it, B and C switch places in the order," with the initial ABC order determined by Dex or who's sitting to the left of whom.  What about this concept kills the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363447/#Comment_363447" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T12:13:48+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 12:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are lots of fantasy adventure games that model combat by having the GM describe the room and where things are and then use mechanics to determine who gets permission to act. Dungeon World combat is a dynamic conversation, where the GM decides what moves he or she is making organically, based on the Principles and the Agenda, and the resulting fiction translates into moves that generate more fiction on the fly. So, The GM can make a hard move "take Damage" or a soft move "reveal an unwelcome truth" and direct them to players based on what they think fits the fictional material best. I find that freeing and cool and I like the way this conversational approach shapes combats into a great story.<br/><br/>I want the GM to create fiction and direct moves at the characters. I don't want the GM shackled to following a DEX order or play always moving to the left. If the GM wants an Orc to charge the Paladin, I want it to happen without regard for whether he is faster than the thief. I'm a big fan of the way DW avoids having the GM just provide a description with mechanics determine order of events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363545/#Comment_363545" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:13:40+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Plus, if you're pinned down by the big nasty with only a handful of HP and you are carrying -1 forward, you may just want to cower for a bit while you fictionally think about what you do.

Basically, when two players want to do something at the same time ask questions and refine the situation to the point where you know which would happen first, but first check if it actually matters who goes first or next.<br/><br/>We did at one point have a general initiative move, which was a mistake. At most you need a "who draws first" move, for when "a split second makes all the difference" or something like that (thanks to Marshall for that wording).<br/><br/>Also note that DW does have turns, as it says in the text, but they're turns like a conversation, not turns like Monopoly.<br/><br/>As for why game-like turns are poisonous: because the flow needs to respond to actions, not turns. The GM's job is to present a fantastic world, when we start making rules about who does what when we're taking away the GM's tools to do that. If we set what a turn is to any fictional (unit of time) or game (number of moves made, or something like that) measure then the GM can't portray the world so much as they just follow who's next and how much time they have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363627/#Comment_363627" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T20:06:25+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  8:06PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 4:09PM by Jason_Pitre.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was running this session and I wanted to test how the game worked with a traditional-sized D&amp;D party.

This is an excellent play style that have a lot of experience with, but is fundamentally at odds with a party style of approach. It felt like I was trying to support 7 unconnected individuals who happen to be going in the same direction, rather then a cohisive party of 7. I was fundamentally looking for more guidance and principles to help me share the spotlight effectively and encourage the feeling of a party.<br/><br/>It doesn't need a mechanic, but some techniques would be very welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363824/#Comment_363824" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T09:26:51+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  9:26AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A party of 7 is huge.

DW is not D&amp;D, of course, but I would like to see it support a party size greater than 4. I'll leave it to more experienced DW hackers to figure out the right compromise/house-rule. (At cons, there will be the pressure to accommodate more folks, so this will be a not-uncommon use case.)<br/><br/>I don't know if I mentioned it in that previous AW/DW thread, but indeed I was working with a party size of 5-7. I survived, sometimes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364222/#Comment_364222" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T10:48:17+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 10:48AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run 5 and 6 player games of DW successfully. I find it a lot harder to make that work as the GM, since a lot of the GMs role is balancing screen time for the players and that gets harder as the group size grows.<br/><br/>That 6 player game was one of the best DW games I've ever been involved in actually, but it worked partially because I knew all the players pretty well and knew that the more passive ones didn't mind playing that way, so I felt less pressure to balance things.<br/><br/>That said, I still advertise my games as 4 player affairs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
