Lots of great suggestions and a kind donation. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So tomorrow I am introducing Shocks, Minutiae, and Issues. I already prepped the class a little bit about creating a science fiction story to address the intersection of social law and physical laws. <br/><br/>I am going to back up a little here. The class is a college level natural science class for pre-service elementary or secondary education teachers. The core tenants of the class are:<br/>We teach fewer things with greater focus on concepts and student exploration.<br/>We stress hands-on, inquiry-based activities to fortify in-class discussions and lecture.<br/>We encourage students to do the teaching through in-class presentations.<br/>We use a variety of assessment tools including testing, oral re-tests, student projects, class presentations, etc.<br/>Where possible, we use field trips to strengthen student understanding.<br/><br/>An important point about how I teach is that there are no points just dynamically assessing understanding and mastering of topics/skills (known as Standards Based Grading, <a href="http://alwaysformative.blogspot.com/p/standards-based-grading-implementation.html" rel="nofollow">see here</a>)<br/><br/>So the topic scale (see the SBG link) is something like this:<br/><b>Topic:</b> Social Law and Physical Laws with Shock<br/><b>4.0</b> Can do all of 3.0 and discuss or demonstrate how and why social laws come into conflict with physical laws. Determine if some social laws operate under pseudo-science<br/><b>3.0</b> Can do all of 2.0 and show evidence of social law and physical laws in science fiction and real world examples.<br/><b>2.0</b> Can define social laws and physical laws. Can identify the difference between the two laws and know that both evolve over time<br/><b>1.0</b> Can do all of 2.0 with some help<br/><br/>So this ranking will change over time since we will be address these things all semester. <br/><br/>Part 2 - Classroom demographics and such                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288845/#Comment_288845" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T14:32:44+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  2:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Part 2</b><br/><br/>The class is 17 women and two men. In this group there is a wide variety of cultural, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds as is typical of New Mexico (a minority majority state). One question I asked on Tuesday was how are kids like scientist. I followed that up with what happens between then and now. One of the most telling answers I got which the class all agreed with was the racial and gender bias in textbooks, classrooms, and teachers. This holds true in science fiction as well. Shock lets us explore/create science fiction while allowing the authors to envision a future they are in instead of being told they don't belong there or have a place. <br/><br/>So why Thursday for this?<br/>There is a lab that's been heavily modified based on Wise and Bluhm, Scientific Observation and the Learning Cycle: Burning the Candle at Both Ends, <i>Journal of College Science Teaching</i>, 2008  <br/><br/>The setup is that we are present with an unknown artifact (it's a candle). Everyone has to make 20 observations about it. The language of the classroom is such that the words candle, wax, and wick are not in our vocabulary. There is a lot more to this I don't want to type it all out.<br/><br/>Part 3 - How it fits in                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

For the whole class period on the board was<br/><br/>Shock: Unknown artifact arrives<br/>Minutiae: The words candle, wick, and wax are not in your vocabulary<br/><br/>I didn't write this Minutiae down but stated it "You are all scientist" I really should have written that down. <br/><br/>So next week I am going to use the same Shock but have each group of four create Minutiae and Issues (maybe even some 'Tagonist). Next post will be on Tuesday unless something comes up that I need to write about here.<br/><br/>Oh and I showed them the book.

One of the Shocks I wrote up was Genderless Society (from Left Hand of Darkness). The class went dead silent. That was a pretty funny moment. A couple people new the story. Others wrinkled up noses in disgust. I knew right away no one was going to take that Shock on.<br/><br/>Today in one group a woman admitted to being geeky and playing World of Warcraft. She knew what RPGs were. I mentioned that I played these games. Another woman in the group responded with something like "Please tell me you aren't a LARPer." I laughed and told her no. Apparently the larp group on campus had a booth at the Welcome Back Day for UNM. I guess they were all dressed up to the hilt (it's a WoD larp) and apparently this weirded out a lot of the incoming 1st year students. I think that gets logged into the Barriers of Getting People into Gaming. <br/><br/>Every time we have worked on the Shock project no one hesitates. Everyone jumps in and plays. I think the structure of the game really helps people get into the story. <br/>One thing (among many) I find cool about this process is watching folks who are underrepresented in all aspects of life getting a voice and seeing stories that matter to them come out through play. Shock also lets everyone have an envisioned future where they have a place which is lacking in most science fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292117/#Comment_292117" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T18:32:39+00:00" title="September  7, 2010  6:32PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2010 9:23AM by akooser.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things I need help with is other games to introduce and why you think they would be a good fit. So just a reminder the audience is non-gamer pre-service elementary ed and secondary ed teachers. Games to specifically target teaching something to teachers or to be used as a framework for running in a class.<br/><br/>Oh another awesome thing I heard was one woman commenting on using games like Shock for her own kids so they can tell collaborative stories. I really need to bring in Happy birthday Robot for her.<br/><br/>Games I think would work for conveying topics in other fields:<br/>Dust Devils<br/>A thousand and One Nights<br/>Thou Art But a Warrior<br/>Hero's Banner<br/>Steal Away Jordan<br/><br/>I would really like to teach a class with the bulk of the class using RPGs as the main teaching tool. Other games that are off my radar?<br/><br/>I think (but could be really wrong about this) that games with explicit procedures for generating stories.

Shock: is enthusiasm-dependent in a way many games aren't in that everyone's required to care about what's going on. Part of the reason the game's designed the way it is, is to maintain that enthusiasm. That's also why you make short stories with it and link them together.</p>\n<p>So, going the opposite route and stretching the game out over many people and days will undeniably reduce that. The fact that the other two groups still got somewhere good is, I suspect, a statement about your abilities as a teacher.</p>\n<p>I have a question: if you were to hazard a guess, would you divide the disengaged from engaged groups by sociopolitical identity?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294265/#Comment_294265" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T08:19:44+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  8:19AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was worried about stretching it out over several days as well.

I have some good evidence based on conversations I overheard in that group. <br/><br/>The other half the class engaged fully in the process, though several groups were missing people and this caused some issues starting.
