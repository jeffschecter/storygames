For example, you (you being "the group", or just even "the producer") decides that you want to set your game in the World of X (X being "Buffy", "X-Files", "Doctor Who", etc), and take on the roles of people or places that fit inside that world, and play out fictional episodes of this spinoff.

I never really say which show per se, but I would call them spinoffs of TNG or DS9.<br/><br/>One spinoff that I did twice, and want to do again many times, is what I call "Badasses of the Federation". This idea came straight from Rafael Chandler, who did this with his buddies using the Star Trek ICON system, where the players would be vicious Vulcan diplomats, Klingon bodyguards, Ex-Federation mercenaries, and would have adventures on the seedier side of the Star Trek universe.<br/><br/>I've run my own "Badasses of the Federation" games, both one-shots. Unfortunately, the last one I did was back in January of 2006 IIRC, so I don't remember much (IIRC, the players were Mark and Travis for that one), just that we had fun, and it was a great introduction to the game. The PCs were mercenary traders who dealt with double-dealing pirates.<br/><br/>Once, with Ben as producer, my weekly group did a fun one-shot of basically a comedic "The reject ensigns of the (TNG) Enterprise". It was a simple one-shot as well, but it did what it was supposed to: It was light and fun, and again another example of how you can jump into play fast if all players are on the ball with the material.<br/>In that game, we had (and I don't remember all the characters):<br/><br/>A "handicapped" ensign, who was actually in one of those Admiral Pike "Iron coffin with only the head showing, with only a single flashing light for communication" chairs, and on top of that was a bitter jackass.<br/>A Hasidic Jew ensign, the first to graduate from the Academy (played by Beth, who is Jewish)<br/>I don't remember my character, really. Something like a Vulcan busybody who was the equivalent of a physical education teacher on the holodeck.<br/>I think that the other character was some sort of gung-ho Jr. security officer, like "Critical Bill" from Things to do in Denver when you're Dead".<br/><br/>We had a little adventure negotiating with senior officers, and given the duty of supplying weapons to starfleet marines who were fighting some alien menace.<br/><br/>Anyway, in the end, I've found that playing in established series is a great way to get everyone on the same page really fast (if they all like the series, that is), which is great for a one-shot in particular.<br/><br/>One of these days, I want to run a complete Star Trek Badasses series, and perhaps explore another series or two: Perhaps Doctor Who, or Supernatural...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71184/#Comment_71184" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T16:11:25+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  4:11PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first few times I've played PTA was in my Shadowrun game, so we already had an existing world setting to draw from, just as if we ran a spinoff from an established television show.  We kept the PTA world in sync with the Shadowrun world for those episodes, but we went around the table recreating characters in PTA fashion.  Two things of note:<br/><br/>1. One of the players didn't quite get that for this game session we were playing PTA, so he kept trying to use things from his Shadowrun character sheets Nothing major, just things like his PTA character had the edge "Spec Ops Training", so he kept trying to reference the martial arts and handgun skill levels from his other character sheet. <br/><br/>2. I learned more about all the characters in a two hour game session of PTA than I did in four different four hour Shadowrun game sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71193/#Comment_71193" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T17:00:21+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  5:00PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1 - We spun off of the Buffyverse to create "Buyer Beware", a new comedy horror action show set in the Sunnydale Mall (with, naturally, no references whatsoever to any of the events of the Buffyverse)<br/><br/>2 - It was basically a bunch of layabouts and losers working at a mall and scheming and being schemed against their rivals, the evil upscale store clerks who were constantly trying to take over the world, cause havoc, summon demons, and so on.<br/><br/>3 - The game ended up being a failure because about half the group hated coming up with scene agendas and felt like crap every time their turn came around the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/darquehope" title="darquehope"><img alt="darquehope" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/darquehope">darquehope</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175120/#Comment_175120" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T20:31:39+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  8:31PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first time I ran PTA, I had 9 people, more than I was really comfortable hosting, but they were all anticipating me running.
