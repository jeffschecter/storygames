BUT, there are a lot of variables.<br/><br/>1) You can easily get away with far fewer but higher-quality/larger illos. See, The Mountain Witch, Shock:, etc. I'd go so far as to say this is a trend in the indie movement necessitated by economics but supported by an actual aesthetic.<br/><br/>2) If you have a lot of charts and tables, you can get away with fewer illos. The idea is that one of the illo's functions is to break up long stretches of text. Charts and tables can serve this function as well.<br/><br/>3) The nature and style of your layout can impact this as well. An "artistic" layout style can obviate the need for some of the art.<br/><br/>4) Format and size play a role. Smaller books can necessarily get away with less art.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113481/#Comment_113481" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T06:55:18+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  6:55AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2007 6:57AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Well, what is the purpose of art in your supplement, obviously people had a lot of different views in that other thread (including my mean-old-man 'get rid of it all' view)?

That might influence what kind of art you're looking for.  <br/><br/>Also, you might consider whether you want fairly homogeneous artwork or if you'd rather include a variety (different styles, media, colors, etc.).  <em>The Shadow of Yesterday</em> uses art from several different artists, which serves to reinforce the differences in the cultures of the game.  On the other hand, having a unified style (by using a single artist, or a very similar style) can pull the whole book together and give it a strong identity (such as with <em>Spirit of the Century</em>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113523/#Comment_113523" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T08:51:54+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  8:51AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me throw my informed 2 cents in here.<br/><br/>The advice given has been pretty good.  I don't have any problems with anything I've read so far.  And I personally think that "indie" games can get away with less art than some of the bigger publishers... partly because focus is usually narrower... even the wide open world of <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> is a much narrower, tight setting than<i> Forgotten Realms.</i><br/><br/>Think about where the art can do the work faster than writing.  It takes about 2 seconds to absorb about 90% of an illustration's info.  How long does it take to absorb a paragraph?  (not read, absorb, understand...).  You can babble for a long time about the heights and weights of 8 races in each individual write up of those races, or I can show it to you in a height hierarchy illustration of all those races side by side in 2 seconds.  That is just one example.<br/><br/>As a playtester of your game Rob, I have more advice.  Your game is about COOL and REBELLION and the  CRAPPY FUTURE THAT OUR CHILDREN INHERIT.  <br/><br/>That is what the art REALLY should convey.  I would look to Transmetropolitan GNs.   80s New Wave.  Cutting edge graphic design in terms of the fringe cultures out there ... (graphitti, snowboarding, skatebording, street drag racing maybe?) and extrapolate 20 mins into the future from there.  I would present the "corporate" part of the text ( the rules, the mechanics) in a real safe, sans-serif font... boring, by the book.  Present the flavor text in something easily read, but a bit radical and fun, like <br/><br/><a href="http://www.1001freefonts.com/simpsonsfont.htm" rel="nofollow">Simpson font</a><br/>or<br/><a href="http://www.1001freefonts.com/blackboysonmopeds.htm" rel="nofollow">BB on Mopeds font</a><br/>... these two were with just a few moments of searching... and the trick is to print some of these out at like 8 or 9 pt and see if it is readable... because I would ALWAYS lean towards the readable over the 'oohh... its so kewl &amp; evocative..." font.<br/><br/>Something like Slammer Tag could be fun for the section headers....<br/><a href="http://www.1001freefonts.com/slammertag.htm" rel="nofollow">Slammer Tag font</a><br/><br/>I would like to see the art be long, narrow verticals, instead of the more common 1/4 spot and the 1/2 page horizontal that you see in most fantasy stuffin's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

We're thinking a lot along the same lines (I'm basically nodding at everything you wrote), but thank you for mentioning Transmetropolitan. That's definitely an influence I have in my head. I want it to be grungy, detailed, dark but fun. As I've been saying, it's sort of the spirit that "Ring Around the Rosie" came out of. People are dying all over from the Black Death, and kids turn it into a fun game. They're having fun and while the world is burning and trying to put out fires in really inefficient ways.<br/><br/>This is a clip from an email I sent earlier today: "Slingshots, graffiti, skateboards, security guards tripping on their tied-together shoelaces, glue-guns and non-lethal weapons.

Jason, you seem to be saying art first. Am I right about that? If so, how do you make the decisions?</blockquote>\nIn my day job, manuscript goes to layout along with finalized art.  Before writers are even hired, I have a bookmap that lays out how long each section is and what goes on which page.  I make a list of necessary art (diagrams and illustrations that convey important information), place those in the bookmap, and then scan over the whole thing for visual interest.  In general, I try to have one item of visual interest on each spread -- an "item of visual interest" is either a piece of art, a chart or table, a header, or some boxed text or sidebar.  A spread with just text is boring.  The eye needs someplace to go.  So any spread that doesn't have something already gets incidental or spot art, and those get added to the list of necessary art.<br/><br/>I write art specs (do I need to unpack that?) and send the specs to the artists about the same time I send out the writing assignments to the writers.  The submissions and roughs come back about the same time.  A few cycles of edits later, I have final manuscript and final art.  These go to design together, so the layout folks have all the assets they'll need to lay out the book.<br/><br/>I should point out that the final product NEVER matches the initial bookmap.  The bookmap is a guide, not a dictate.  Things shift around and get repurposed in edits, and occasionally in pages.<br/><br/>Make sense?

It's helpful to have a good idea of your probable layout before you try to contract your artwork, but you can't know that until you have the bulk of your text in hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113930/#Comment_113930" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T18:40:29+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  6:40PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite><b>Writing &gt; Planning Layout &gt; Art &gt; Actual Layout</b></blockquote>\nYeah -- that's pretty much right as the "ideal form", I think.<br/><br/>The last two bits can happen somewhat in parallel.  Sometimes you're looking for images that fit exactly into a bit of whitespace you didn't realize you had until you created it in your layout efforts, so I see the last two as a sort of hazy muddle / self-feeding loop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
