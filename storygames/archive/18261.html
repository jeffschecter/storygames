PCs are sorcerers with the magic to bind creatures of this world into their service.<br/><br/>Players may begin with any 1HD/1CR monster from any rules text compatible with that edition. The combat rules are consistent with the edition in use and they explore dungeons as per normal with these exceptions:<br/><br/>- PCs are always considered noncombatants by monsters, and their sorcery allows them to flee battles unharmed.<br/><br/>- The powerful magics that bind creatures to their service knits their flesh together and keeps them from dying should they fall in battle.<br/><br/>- Monsters level as PC warriors, with their level equivalent to their HD/CR. When a monster gains a level, they may either gain 1HD, or it may be transformed by the sorcery and their growing power into a new form. The player may choose any monster with their new HD/CR that the rest of the group finds has some kind of biological or thematic connection to the previous monster (Skeleton =&gt; Bone Golem, for example). Monsters may only evolve twice.<br/><br/>- PCs begin as level 1 sorcerers. They gain sorcerer levels by plumbing ancient ruins and dungeons and facing Monster Lords. There are six dark societies lead by six Monster Lords, each who have six monsters under their command. Defeating a Monster Lord gains you their artifacts and enhances your sorcerous powers by 1 level.<br/><br/>- PCs may only be accompanied by one monster at a time, but other monsters may be stored as unstable mystical energies in receptacles.<br/><br/>- Once per day, PCs may attempt to capture a defeated monster (dead creatures are also acceptable targets, the sorcerous energy will return them to life) and bind it with sorcery. Roll a d20 + Sorcerer level. Target # is 11+ Monster HD/CR. Only one attempt may be made, if it is failed the creature's body is obliterated by the sorcerous energies.<br/><br/>- Magical treasures and artifacts are per normal, though there are members of the dark societies who specialize in adapting such treasures for nonhumanoid monsters. Seek them out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411855/#Comment_411855" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T10:42:00+00:00" title="April 11, 2013 10:42AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a friend who played something similar. An extra twist they added - your monsters were played by the other players, which gave them much more personality. Otherwise, your monsters are basically magic items.<br/><br/>I would limit the number of monsters you can have available based on your level (Level +2, or something?) in order to make the player make more hard choices and develop more of an attachment to a limited number of beasties.<br/><br/>Also, I would not use D&amp;D for the mechanics. I would use something that better emulated the encouragement that trainers give to their beasties and to their other trainer friends during a fight. Something more like Smallville, with the way that relationships are at the heart of all your rolls. Or maybe some sort of weird mashup - like the trainers are playing Smallville but the monsters are playing something tactical like D&amp;D. Savage Worlds for the monsters might give your enough tactical complexity while having mechanics that would hook up with Smallville better.<br/><br/>Of course, it depends on what you want it to be - more of a cute drift of D&amp;D, or more of a Pokemon RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411876/#Comment_411876" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T16:51:19+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  4:51PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I'd love to hear how that works for you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411892/#Comment_411892" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-12T01:56:23+00:00" title="April 12, 2013  1:56AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me and a housemate have actually been working on a Pokemon system from scratch, running off some odd hybrid of FATE and AW with inspiration from Ubiquity that I can probably get to you in a few days when I get back home.<br/>We tried more to imitate the cinematic action of the anime and films, rather than the tactical action of the games when we were working on it, though, so it might not suit your purpose. It would probably work well for any monsters game, but would need new playbooks (The current idea is to consider writing playbooks for each element, rather than a pokemon/evolutionary line, and having the cross-playbook moves be moves outside the element the monster can learn). We found the most functional way to do encouragement is to consider it a 'condition', the same as poison or paralysis, in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411894/#Comment_411894" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-12T05:58:48+00:00" title="April 12, 2013  5:58AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally considered writing a <i>Pokethulu</i> campaign setting for <i>Anima Prime</i>.
