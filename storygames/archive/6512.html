Usually I find that the players are telling you what they want the scene to be about through their chosen issue and how they play the scene. You don't need to do a lot of scene agenda setup and, in fact, it's easy to do too much.<br/><br/>One thing I do to promote "seeing where the game goes" is to really listen to the players during each scene and make the conflict in the scene about their character's issue. Rather than set the stakes of a conflict as "do you succeed" at some action, I make it "do you overcome your issue" to do or not do what you want in the scene. Quite often, they give in to their issue so that they can do whatever action was intended and that adds depth to their character and add tension to the story even though they "succeeded".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144325/#Comment_144325" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T18:06:04+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  6:06PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 6:06PM by Jesse.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I draw your attention to my participation on pages 1 and 4 of this discussion:<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=393879" rel="nofollow">RPG.net PtA Discussion</a><br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144552/#Comment_144552" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T14:35:44+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  2:35PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2008 7:06PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: forlorn1</cite>So I'm greedy, and I want to make my PTA games the best they can be.

Your game was the first game of PTA I had ever played, and I don't want to take away from the awesome that it was. Because of you I really wanted to jump into Remi's game, almost messing up his mojo. Neither game was bad, but both were definitely different. <br/><br/>Ok, ... deep breath. <br/><br/>I was in "Unit of Worship" and Remi's game "Eve of Destruction" so I guess I could toss my 2 centimes in. Big differences I noticed 1. Our relationship map in both games was totally different, probably just a fluke but I think they seriously influenced the direction play went and here's why. Instead of setting up a lot of conflict between characters (and there was a little) our R-map in Eve of Destruction  centred around our relationship with an NPC, Eve. Practically everyone had some sort of connection to her either directly or through someone else. In Unit of Worship a lot of players were tightly tied to other players, but not effectively tied to others. In fact we had two opposing groups of characters Primus's Cult and Bacchuses Mob. <br/><br/>Tangent- In Eve, we had PVP conflicts, and as long as we kind of agreed beforehand it worked pretty well. I think we shied away from one or two great conflicts in Unit because of the fear of losing free agency. Maybe thats something that could be dealt with prior to playing? I don't know but its worth some thought.  <br/><br/>Ok, going back to the R map. I think that mattered because of the way that we were handling episodes. Remi was running under a mini-series hack where 3 characters had the spotlight, during the whole thing but not at the same time. Everyone else had a 2, and if your spotlight was over you got a 1. <br/>Unit of Worship was the season finale. For con play as exciting as a finale can be, your almost forced to do a lot of playing before you play. In fact I'd do episode 1 or 2 for con play instead of doing a finale, because at least one character has a spotlight, without forcing players to establish a whole season of history before you even start setting scenes. That worked against us because we had 2 opposed groups with a big history of conflict between them. <br/><br/>I liked the mini series hack because it gave a lot of folks a spotlight and took place in acts, each one actually ending pretty organically. Act One, Johnny Lightning turning his back on the Punk rock crowd and becoming a defender. Act II Lance Shooting Johnny's sister in the face and act III the whole compound getting overrun from the inside and the outside at the same time. <br/><br/>It was pretty exciting, but I dont know if it was the right combination of ideas and players that did it or the mechanic. Im tempted to say mechanic, because Crisis of faith had some excellent players. Anyhow for a one off it was brilliant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144579/#Comment_144579" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T17:00:47+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  5:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in Remi's game and have played PTA quite a bit. I hope this will be helpful to you (some of it overlaps with Jeff's post):<br/><br/>- Remi was great at making sure that everyone was 100% bought into the show's premise and was willing to throw it all out until it worked.<br/><br/>- We not only set up the show's premise but we had several large conflicts established as well. Military state trying to recruit the punk rock community. Punk Rock rebellion. Zombies trying to invade the city. These conflicts fed into each other and created a lot of subtext for us to work with.<br/><br/>- Remi created an NPC to symbolize the overall conflict and had us all form a relationship with them. <br/><br/>- We then each established 1 other relationship. Then the player to our right linked to that relationship somehow.<br/><br/>- We ditched personal sets.<br/> <br/>- He also condensed the game into 3 individual episodes of PTA where 3 people were spotlighted. In their spotlight episodes they had a presence of 3 and then a 1 for every other episode. The non-spotlighted characters had a presence of 2 all the time.<br/><br/>- Our issues were less issues and more goals or beliefs like in Burning Wheel. Mine was, "kill punk rock." We still had issues but we just never stated them. If we did issues traditionally, mine would have been "hypocrite." I was actually obsessed Punk Rock. But instead of being a hypocrite off the bat, we let our beliefs reveal our issues in play.<br/><br/>- We didn't keep track of edges. Instead we played it loose to what felt right in a scene.<br/><br/>- Players set up scenes. We never explicitly detailed focus, agenda, or location but instead described a scene and implied those details. Then let the GM go crazy by introducing elements on top of that to create tension.<br/><br/>- The game was set up to be Player vs. Player. We started out forming 2 sides. The police state and everyone else. But then had PvP within those sides as well. Every conflict reflecting the tensions of the overall conflicts we setup. <br/><br/>- In creating the show or setting stakes... when anyone started "playing before we started playing", meaning describing content that would be better played in game, Remi would stop us immediately and ask us to save it for the game. The stakes were much tighter this way. And we stuck to stakes that involved our characters' actions rather than more meta level stakes.<br/><br/>- In PTA you can't have perpendicular stakes. Because it isn't actually player vs. player (even when the conflict seems that way). It's all players vs. the producer. Anyone who beats the producer gets what they want. So 2 players fighting could both win a conflict. Additionally the Producer doesn't have stakes normally. They can only set difficulty and narrate if they draw the highest card. All this can lead to flat situations. The game is waaaaaaay more interesting when the Producer has stakes. Otherwise it sometimes feels like we are just playing to see who gets to say what. Where the producer has stakes, not only are we trying to get what we want but also trying to keep some horrible unforeseen results from occurring. Which adds a lot of tension. So what we did was have the Producer have stakes, allow true PvP, and have who ever draws the most hearts wins vs. just beating the producer. <br/><br/>- We played narrating very loose. Instead of the person with the highest card narrating, they more acted like a GM and allowed the players to describe how they won or lost and adding details as necessary. We actually ignored who drew the highest card several times. <br/><br/>- We ditched the limit on awarding fan mail. Instead of each player only being able to award 1 point of fan mail per scene, we loosened the restriction so that each player can award fan mail to multiple other players in a scene as long as they don't give a single player fan mail more than once. Fan mail flowed quite often! <br/><br/>- If a scene didn't look like it would hit a conflict, we didn't force a conflict. We simply played till we hit conflicts rather than artificially putting them in. Although Remi did a great job adding so much tension that conflicts came very naturally. <br/><br/>- We used the "car chase" rules quite a bit to add drama when flipping cards. I love this optional rule! <br/><br/>- Remi made sure that everyone had something to do. He would look around the table, spot the person who has done the least, and target the drama at them.<br/><br/>- Remi also encouraged everyone to throw out suggestions any time while not blocking each other's input. Everyone really helped everyone else shine.<br/><br/>- Remi also constantly inter-cut between multiple scenes which was awesome! <br/><br/>I think that's most of it.<br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144588/#Comment_144588" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T17:55:37+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  5:55PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2008 6:17PM by Remi.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, guys, thanks! I lost a big long post last night due to a power outage, and haven't had time to recreate it today. <br/><br/>A couple things:<br/>1. Eve emerged out of your Issue creation organically. I pushed a little on it once three people in a row had latched onto her as a central character, but it wasn't my intention to create a singular interconnected NPC. It actually made it a little difficult to access her sometimes because she was SO meaningful to everyone at the table.<br/><br/>2. We only used the Car Chase rules twice, both for arguments, I think. I save the mechanic for situations which require a little back-and-forth or expanded narration. An argument between two people fits this as well as a car chase.<br/><br/>2. John, thank you for listing all the ways I drift PTA. It's good to have that catalogue to examine. I never realized PTA had so much overhead! I can't imagine setting up all that stuff at the beginning of a scene.<br/><br/>3. Jeff, you didn't almost disrupt any mojo that I can remember. You rocked out while I kicked your ass!<br/><br/>Jeff/forlorn1, is there anything that I can expand on? To break it down a bit, my PTA style comes from several sources.<br/><b>Improv</b>: Intercutting scenes, setting up situations quickly, encouraging agreement and group input, the 'no denial' rule in the Pitch (which wasn't mentioned, but is an important difference for me). <br/><b>Application of Actual Play </b>: The change in the Issues, the fanmail, and the high card responsibilities, the Spotlight shifts.<br/><b>My Neuroses</b>: Getting through the pitch as fast as possible, making sure everyone at the table is getting solid play time, discomfort with the traditional GM role translating to differences in scene framing. <br/><b>Not knowing the PTA text all that well</b>: Ignoring a lot of the scene framing and conflict guidelines.<br/><br/>I do want to say that I've tuned PTA so that it is easy for me to run. Not all of these things will work for everyone, in fact, sometimes it doesn't work 100% correctly for me (see: My Dreamation game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144595/#Comment_144595" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T18:38:59+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  6:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "- If a scene didn't look like it would hit a conflict, we didn't force a conflict.

"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there were a few "building scenes" where we just let the scene lead to another, and that was awesome. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I totally forgot/ or didn't think about the fact that we had two sets of antagonistic characters in Eve... just like in unit. I think in retrospect because we all tried very very hard to go with the flow and let stuff evolve into the final product. Eve was very much a collaborative story that was reigned in by mechanics. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot saying no in the pitch was a big part of that and pretty much every character had a MAJOR change in the story that really affected the outcome.<br/>\nI was actually viscerally affected by a few scenes. Johns character showing me the room full of punk rock albums, guitars, amps and the like sent a chill down my back, me suggesting that Anna's sister zombie could talk was really creepy, and me changing sides had everyone going OOOOH. And lets not forget John shot someone in the FACE.

Those wonderful social graces that make hanging out and playing games with friends a relaxing and fun experience seemed to be working against us when we were hunting the legendary unanimous enthusiasm...whereas if we'd had someone who was willing to give a decisive NO whenever he detected a whiff of "not really interested" coming off someone's "sure, why not?" response, I think it would have helped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144642/#Comment_144642" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T06:52:45+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  6:52AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You nailed it with:<br/><br/>"At some point, someone is apparently able to say "Let's not use this," right? Even if it's only after everyone else has tried to build on it and make it the best it can be and it STILL doesn't sing for the group?" <br/><br/>In our case that someone was Remi. After everyone expressed their ideas, he would combine them and poll everyone to see if they were excited or still not quite feeling yet. We actually went back and forth 2-3 times but very quickly and in the end it was very worth it!<br/><br/>In terms of brainstorming with friends, that's tough. I've had that happen before. In some ways it was almost easier doing this at a con where we didn't all know each other and wanted to have as much fun as possible with our limited time.<br/><br/>When I say Remi polled us above, he didn't just do so by asking people how they felt but also by paying attention to our facial expressions, body language, energy level, and how excited we seemed. So in the case of someone who thinks:<br/><br/>"Well, he's my friend, so as long as I don't hate his idea, I'm not going to say no, even though it personally doesn't interest me that much."<br/><br/>Remi would try to determine their interest based on non verbal cues. And even if the results of brainstorming don't produce results that everyone is 100% happy with, at the very least there should be one aspect that everyone is excited about. In those cases, calling on someone's character's issue can be a huge help. Say Friend X didn't love the show's premise. Then use their issue to retroactively alter the premise enough to make the game interesting specifically for them. The premise is only the starting point. The issue is where we can really refine things and make sure everyone is happy.<br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144643/#Comment_144643" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T06:59:47+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  6:59AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it came down to the producer marrying all the elements at the end and creating a wonderful story from what people had a huge reaction too.  Our original premise was a cop show, set in a confined space like the SDF 1 with zombies and punk rock thrown in. Before hand I think we had a chance to say what we didn't want to play ... no cartoons, no blah blah blah... but the important thing was that everyone have some sort of stake in the story even if others arent sure what to do with it...<br/>\n<br/>\nIm not sure if this worked because we just wanted it to work, or if it was because of the policy. It certainly kept us from alienating anyone at the table before play... Nothing puts a stop on someones creativity more than saying no... your idea doesnt fit with everyone and I can't get 100 percent buy in so its gone.

Basically I don't want to alienate player input. The Producer should be totally willing to throw out the combined pitch if it isn't hitting with the group, because their Pitch shouldn't input anything new, it should just be a synthesis of the ideas presented, straining out the bits into a coherent whole. John's right that I ask, "Does that sound good?" and if I don't get at least some kind of reaction from everyone at the table, I start building again.<br/><br/>This is a very Producer-centric technique. It's the responsibility of the Producer to combine what people are excited about into a coherent whole. If the Producer abuses this, I'd imagine it could get very ugly. You want to try to honor everyone's suggestion, at least a little. I try to be as clear as possible to the player WHAT I am drawing out of their suggestion. My hope is that if I haven't gotten any part of what's exciting to them about their suggestion, they'll tell me or indicate it in some way. I also try to be clear how I get to my Pitch suggestion, so people can see where they want to fill out more, or what aspect of the Pitch they'd like to concentrate on.<br/><br/>Also, this is totally a technique for Con scenarios where time is at a premium. Still, I think encouraging people not to shut each other down and build on one another's ideas is useful anywhere. Another common technique is the "No, But" technique where you are allowed to turn down a suggestion, but only if you have a suggestion to take its place. This takes  a lot longer, though, although it does create a 'smoother' pitch where the constituent parts are a little less obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144657/#Comment_144657" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T09:34:10+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  9:34AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing that works instead of trying to protect everyone's feeeeeeelings, is just to pound the table with his fist and yell, "That's the worst idea since Albert moved to town on Little House on the Prairie!

That puts a time limit on idea-fleshing-out.<br/>Get episode concepts along with show concepts by yelling "SO WHAT, what does that do for us?"<br/>Setting and plot ideas are good but they'll never last more than a ten second blurb if you don't tie it in to a character<br/>Brag about your clout and promise you'll "go to bat" for an idea with the networks/sponsor/blogging nerds on the Internet if it needs to get a bit more attention                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144684/#Comment_144684" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T15:39:04+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  3:39PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oooh and work in product placement... folks this needs to have GM cars all throughout... how else can you justify commercials...<br/>\n<br/>\nActually Im kind of curious what commercial breaks might do for play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144685/#Comment_144685" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T16:09:14+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  4:09PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Commercial breaks are cool.<br/><br/>When someone delivers the perfect line to button up the scene and you fade to black... commercial break!

People can ooh and aaah, laugh, pat each other on the back, sigh, and generally reflect and appreciate the game, outside the flow of play.<br/><br/>Go get a drink, bathroom break, whatever. Then, when everyone is back at the table, and the chit-chat dies down, the show comes back, and it's game on again.<br/><br/>The art of the perfectly timed commercial break is something the best shows master.
