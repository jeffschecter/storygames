Right now I'm unsure if I'm taking the right direction to emphasize the character-growth aspect of the game, and I wanted to see if discussing this could help (to either refine it or rework it).<br/><br/>To sum the premise, the game is about young adults who chose as a career to breathe in gods and borrow their divine power to fight criminal spirits, with the setting taking after Korean shamanism. One core mechanic is that a PC can "swap" various gods they are joining to suit the situation. The catch, however, is that whether a particular god with a particular set of abilities chooses to join the PC is a matter of personal relationship and interdependent faith. Communion with a god is taken as a very intimate thing.<br/><br/>I decided that the PCs should be young adults for two reasons: 1) in Korean shamanism, near the end of young adulthood (around mid-to-late 20s) is when an initiate is first possessed - irrevocably - by the gods, starting her commencement as a full shaman... and therefore someone who is halfway toward shamanhood would be forced to choose at the end of their career; and 2) those near the end of character formation should be the most volatile subjects to have <i>others</i> enter their very soul, and to have them see their unspoken anxieties and dreams. (The fact that myelin sheath formation occurs around the end of young adulthood is also a factor, but that's more of a metaplot bait than anything else.)<br/><br/>Given those reasons, the PCs (I believe) would be driven to build relationships with the gods who enter them. As a part of their job as an exorcist, multiple gods get to take an inside peek at the character's inner world. Being characters with full personality that are emulated by the gaming group at the table (another shaky issue I want to discuss, but at a later time), they would become confidantes that someone at the brink of growth and change <i>needs</i>. The narrative mechanic that I foresee is that the players will use these gods as hooks to hang their character plot threads.<br/><br/>Driving that point further (perhaps too far) is that, for a PC to draw in more power from an individual god, they must pass open-ended challenges or "quests" that the god presents. The idea is that, until the god is certain that the character has proven their worth, they will withhold their greatest strengths. However, this is the thing that I'm the most finicky about at the moment. Clearly, I as the person who is writing this game cannot write up dozens of different gods, since each must be treated as a character -and- a mechanical feature. Furthermore, certain gods will be more "popular" than others. Therefore, as the players play this game, certain narrative milestones (the challenges) will come up more often than others.<br/><br/>While I like the idea that a character's growth as a character is actively encouraged by the mechanics, I am worried if this ties possible character developments to a character build bottleneck. The game is very game-y with heavy emphasis on fighting. With games of that sort, character optimization has seemed inevitable. If so, maybe even character growth optimization may happen... which would be entirely counterproductive.<br/><br/>I know that full details are not shared (and this post is already verbose as it is) but I wanted to see if anyone is willing to provide feedback on what I've already elaborated so far. Am I worrying over nothing, or did I notice a critical design fault?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430667/#Comment_430667" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T02:57:27+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  2:57AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You haven't said much about the mechanics but I'll take a stab: You say there's a lot of "game-y emphasis on fighting" and you worry this will lead to optimization, gamism, and sameness?  Have you considered maybe broadening out your "fight" mechanics so they can be used for all types of conflict or contest, not just martial?  That way the game mechanics could remain "fighty" but the narrative interpretations could get wild.  The gods could be different every time, whatever the players can come up with, and the characters would be too.  The GM would have to come up with staged challenges pertaining to the god's sphere of infuence of course, but that's the whole idea, yes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430687/#Comment_430687" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T08:45:18+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  8:45AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say you actually spotted a critical design fault, even when the game could work for some groups, people coming from trad games will certainly be looking for those buttons that enable them to game the system. If you're saying that your game is "fighty" my first impression is that most probably the players will focus on fighting and all related competition, and use the narrative mechanics just as color or as a way to gain leverage on the fighting scenes, thus gaming the system.<br/><br/>I'd reccomend you to focus on what kind of experience you want. You can either emphasize narrative growth thus building the game around this and hand-wave fights or embrace combat and allow the narrative element to appear through emergence. I'm saying this because in my experience, whenever you try to force players to get into narration through rules in the middle of a game that has a chance to develop into a competition, there's a high probability that you will end up having players game the system to win the competition.<br/><br/>Now, if the rules actually help players build narration based on what happened on the competition, inspiring them with new ideas for taking the story further and making "losing a competition" into an opportunity for adding new fictional material, then the game flow gets optimized instead of stalling or getting contaminated with some resent to the winner of the competition.<br/><br/>Tenra Bansho is somehow an example of the opposite and maybe something closer to what you're looking: there you have to roleplay not only to feed your powers but to avoid becoming a monster by letting go of things/overcome them. It's all mechanically supported by the game and gaming the system there means you have to roleplay, so it's a win-win situation.<br/><br/>Also, I dunno if your mechanic already includes something like this (looks so by some of the details you mentioned) but I'd let other players create and roleplay the gods, a<i> la</i> <a href="http://www.greatorkgods.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Great Ork Gods</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/szp" title="szp"><img alt="szp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/191/n7DTE2GEA3S70.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/szp">szp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430716/#Comment_430716" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T22:30:35+00:00" title="April  8, 2014 10:30PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Have you considered maybe broadening out your "fight" mechanics so they can be used for all types of conflict or contest, not just martial?

I love playing the kind of games you are alluding to, and I would love to work on a project like that (one idea in the back burner is along this line...), but I am uncertain if this current project can benefit from broadening conflict mechanics. Perhaps this could have been a good idea if I had decided this in the earlier part of brainstorming the fundamentals...\n<blockquote>I'd reccomend you to focus on what kind of experience you want.

Some of the challenges that gods give out to the PCs will require them to learn humiliation, go against impossible odds, or deliberately do something that a fighter normally wouldn't do. The relationship between the gods and the PCs are that of mentorship, and immortal spirits have had plenty of time to learn from their own failures.\n<blockquote>Also, I dunno if your mechanic already includes something like this (looks so by some of the details you mentioned) but I'd let other players create and roleplay the gods, a la Great Ork Gods</blockquote>\nYeah, and I'm not surprised this has been done somewhere else already. The idea is that, when a character is consulting a god, the other players at the table collectively roleplay the god in question, with the ideas that a god's personality is a matter of collective consensus and that a god behaves the way people expect them to - rather important aspects of Korean shamanism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430718/#Comment_430718" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T23:27:42+00:00" title="April  8, 2014 11:27PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2014 11:28PM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This probably is the crux of the issue - I'm perhaps trying to go for both game-y and story-y flavors and failing to balance them.</blockquote>\nThis is a huge trouble with <b>Once Upon a Time</b>, where you got competition through the game structures and exploration of fiction. It will end up with either bad stories or being non-competitive. If the group hasn't come to an agreement of which one to settle with, then the session will contain competitive players AND explorative players that will tear the game in two direction. In the end, it will become a fluke to create good fiction or a good competitive experience.<br/><br/>So either you tone down the competitive elements or you scrap the idea of building something fiction-like to the structure of the game. For the first one, I'm not saying that you can't have fights, but you should remove the competition. Like how many war movies doesn't have anything to do with the war itself but with the people who happens to be in a war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430748/#Comment_430748" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T12:51:59+00:00" title="April  9, 2014 12:51PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, if you both want fighty-ness and story I believe there is a way: do not force either of them. I made the same mistake before, I thought my party was too much trigger-happy and tend to abuse mechanics to get direct or indirect leverage in combat; I thought the system could correct this and help everyone have both fight and story. Some mechanics give out this vibe, but the actual result depends mostly on the<b> atmosphere</b> created by the GM, the <b>social contract</b> and <b>creative agenda</b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">defined in the first session</span> (either talked into agreement, imposed by the GM or based on everyone's assumptions over previous game experiences with this group or others, the former two being better than the last one)<br/><br/>So, where some players learn to use the system to get both their fights and enjoy a good story, others may end up going into a competitive mode, try to have their fun at the expense or others or game the system. And I'm sure most of the time it\xb4s not about the player, but about a misscomunication on the points above or a lack of tools from the GMs or player's side to built a different game experience.<br/><br/>For example, first point you should be really clear is how lethal the game would be. This is the origin of most out-of-fiction issues. Test the game in arena mode to find out how quick a character will die. Talk with the players to see if everyone is fine with that or if you need to make adjustments. When players know exactly how lethal the game is, they always adjust their PC's actions accordingly into something more suitable for the setting. Believe me, you will see the difference.<br/><br/>Second, be clear on what's the game about; actually when different players hear the word RPG they all have in their heads a different kind of fun. Some will fondly remember a specially good GM's interpretation of a roll they made, or how they foiled a big railroading plan of a GM, or how they came up with an idea or a dialogue that surprised everyone on the table. These are all different kinds of fun, and might be at odds with the GMs agenda, not to mention other player's fun. Have everyone on the same page about this so they know exactly where the fun will be.<br/><br/>Third, take out the distractions. I'm not talking about cellphones or other distractions of that kind on the table, I'm talking design-wise of all mechanics that doesn't directly add anything to the fun you're looking for, like encumbrance rules or amunnition management or whatever. Hand-wave this or apply a general ruling, no matter how interesting you find that these may influence the fiction: if the game is not about this, there rules will never come into play or at least not enough to distract the players with them.<br/><br/>As a sub-section of the previous, if you want to go for the story I'd add: take out as many numbers as you can. I know there are a lot of really smart people that can handle them with no problem and even felt more comfortable dealing with numbers than roleplaying. If numbers help you roleplay, then keep it. If not, you're probably like me, a person that can handle numbers and fictional positioning all right, but freezes for a second when needing to switch between both. I even have some short-memory issues so counting turns for X effect to end and remembering to use the bonus generated by it while doing other tactics is almost impossible. All I want to know is the current state of the fiction and how high do I have to roll to change it.<br/><br/>Allow me to go back on "not forcing players": I'm not referring to railroading, you can be a great illusionist and your players can be accomplished in collaborative play so you can all still have lots of fun. I'm speaking more design-wise here since, whenever you introduce a mechanic that forces players to do something, even if it's by rewarding them for doing it, you're bound to have at least a few intents at gaming the system. For example, I tried introducing Fate-like Aspects in an earlier design of my game. This mechanic is certainly amazing to help players make their characters unique, but when I gave them a mechanic reward for using them, the game went gonzo with players pushing that button to get a bonus to their rolls. Instead, it's a lot better to use aspects to define the character, but only reward the players when doing a good scene (either using them or not) or whenever you want to compel their aspects.<br/><br/>Now, I believe the original Aspects mechanic is really good, I'd say this was perhaps  just me not explaining the players enough about how to use it properly, and a lack of more tools to handle the situations generated by the misuse of this mechanic. I should had read the core rules more carefully.<br/><br/>So I can't help but worry whenever I hear that there's a game trying to ellicit a certain behaviour from the players trough the rules. If those rules aren't incredibly clever about it, it's probably bound to have players resist it somehow by avoiding it, "forgetting" to apply those rules when it means a disadvantage for them in the fiction, gaming the system or maybe roll with it just for the sake of the group's fun instead of by themselves. Think of this: How many times did you chose to play a "legal good" character just because you wanted to try the Paladin or Monk in D&amp;D, instead of because legal good characters are interesting? (which can totally be, if you don't play them by the book) If you did, how many of your fellow players also found it fun?  How many times have you seen somebody making fun of them in the fiction because of their alignment? And how many times you regretted choosing that alignment because it limited your options in the fiction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/szp" title="szp"><img alt="szp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/191/n7DTE2GEA3S70.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/szp">szp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430763/#Comment_430763" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T18:22:23+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  6:22PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> Thanks for the amazing feedback. I'm learning a lot from the points you've brought up.<br/><br/>I had been thinking about this part of the game for a while now and I think the social contract aspect could be something I can use to smooth out the details once I've gotten them written down. While the agreement on what kinda game is being played is something that happens on the table, as a product I may be able to tell people that this game can be played in this way or that way. It's not deciding whether this game is about competition or fiction, like it was suggested in this thread, but this could be a step toward finding some kind of compromise.<br/><br/>I'm still in the process of sorting ideas, but I'm gradually moving towards minimizing or abandoning the idea of encouraging/forcing character growth via hardcoded plot seeds.

Take Tenra Bansho for instance, a brilliant game where mechanics feed the fiction in a way that both forces players to roleplay a bit, but also gives them inspiration and freedom to create those scenes themselves. Turning feedback into something physical as Aiki Chits seems to help the rewarding system there too. Take AW games, where the Moves help to introduce interesting material to the fiction even with bad rolls, thus keeping things going foward. In both cases, the system helps players create the story, instead of just rewarding them for making it.<br/><br/>The same games also do a nice work helping define the social contract. In tenra bansho there's a refreshingly surprising section about how you win the game both as a GM and a player, by helping everybody have fun. While not a rule, it certainly helps you focus on the important thing: this is a game, after all. On the case of AW games, there's the Principles that help define this crucial step, often overlooked of defining the social contract and getting everyone on the same page. I do agree with GMs that say that you can only learn to play the game by playing it, but hours of arguments and ruined sessions can be perfectly avoided just by clearly stating these guidelines from the beggining of the game.<br/><br/>So, my advice is that you should try a bit of both. Use mechanics that help players create original characters and situations, but don't give them mechanical rewards for that, since everything they will do will contribute to the game <i>Flow</i> (as long as the GM let them and builds on it instead of railroading over their input), which it's already the best reward by itself. Also, try to set a procedure to help define the game's atmosphere, the limits and timing of player's and GM's agency at the very first session. Whatever interrupts these mechanics/procedures is unefficient and may probably be better discarded or hand-waved. Whatever helps the GM/players built the atmosphere/fits the genre is more than welcome.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
