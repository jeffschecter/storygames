With this this idea of having somebody post a situation each monday (roughly) and challenging the forum subscribers to introduce a BANG in it. A bang is a term I learned about on this forum, but it\u2019s older than that. I found this definition on Wikipedia.\n<blockquote>A "bang" is a situation that requires a choice from the player as to how the character will respond to the situation. The choice will often be thematically relevant, based on the Humanity definition and earlier events in the game. For a bang to be effective, the game master shouldn't force a specific choice, and the player doing nothing should also have consequences.<br/></blockquote>\nSo what do you say we practice coming up with bangs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482724/#Comment_482724" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-29T19:51:54+00:00" title="April 29, 2019  7:51PM">April 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 1: Monday, the 29th of April<br/><br/>Montana Roberts, a middle aged American adventurer-scholar is browsing the charming market stalls of Cairo Egypt in the year 1943.

He conceptualized the idea for his rpg <i>Sorcerer</i> in the early '00s as an answer to a specific technical question: how can a GM meaningfully prepare gaming material for a game that specifically excludes GM-developed plot? In other words, what is it that you prep if you aren't prepping one of the therefore known forms of GM preparation:<br/><br/>You're not prepping <b>an adventure location</b> like you would do for D&amp;D, and<br/>you're not prepping <b>a sequel of scenes that form a story</b> like you would for a traditional rpg adventure.<br/><br/>So what is it that you do instead? Ron's answer is that a game that cannot use a geographical structure or story structure in its procedures is still capable of using analytically chopped up content: ideas about characters, places, situations and themes that might be introduced into the game at suitable moments during its execution. This chopped up content could be crafted into little narrative rosettes that retain an inherent moral conundrum without also requiring the entire play session to revolve around introducing and micromanaging the moment of revelation. The GM wouldn't be reading a script, but they would rather have something that Ron calls a "bandolier of Bangs": a list of relevant pre-prepared content ideas that could be accessed in arbitrary order and used as needed to provide the game with steady and constructive content.<br/><br/>(If all this seems vaguely familiar to fans of never roleplaying games, well, it <b>is</b> one of the major innovations of '00s rpg tech.)<br/><br/>Bangs can, depending on the game and its specifics, be prepared specifically for individual player characters, or they can address the game's setting. They are generally used for narrativist games (that's a GNS theory term, please ignore this sentence if you aren't familiar), but the technique per se is agenda-neutral: it might suit you for any game where the GM wants to prepare content, but doesn't want to prejudice themselves about the way this content gets treated in play. As Bangs don't have any causal relationships to each other, or planned order of use, the GM should in principle be able to retain their balance and avoid over-committing to ideas about where the game is going. You just sit there, pitch out Bangs as needed, and play to see what happens.<br/><br/>A simple example of a narrativist Bang could be something like these ones. I write them intentionally in the way I might jot them down myself as a GM.<br/><br/><b>Player character A gets accosted by their boyfriend. The boyfriend wants to break up, as she doesn't really seem to care about him, as proven by the events of the last session.</b><br/><br/><b>The adventurers arrive at the gate to the Golden City. They learn that each free entrant is expected to enter with a slave, such that the balance of free and slave inside the City remains unbroken. They provide the shackles if necessary.</b><br/><br/><b>Non-player character X accosts one of the PCs, probably the nicest-seeming one. They ask for help in smuggling a strange parcel out of the city. The parcel actually hides the NPC's brother, a wanted outlaw.</b><br/><br/>All of the above are pretty normal Bangs, obviously created for specific (imaginary) campaigns of specific games. There are a lot of different games that do well with Bang-based prep, so I won't start listing them here, but do keep in mind that Banging isn't supremely universal. The simplest Bangs are easy to transfer between games, but many of the best ones are carefully crafted for very specific theming in specific campaigns. What is meaningful depends on the context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482729/#Comment_482729" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-29T21:11:36+00:00" title="April 29, 2019  9:11PM">April 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, it's Chloe alright.

He\u2019d tried every rule in the book. He took his sigarette from the ashtray, took a drag and punched it out on the newspaper heading. He emptied his whisky, left the cash on the counter, tip included and left.

There will be times when I have my own ideas, but generally my favourite technique, in terms of ease and effectiveness, is just combining those elements to create new fictional input.<br/><br/>I'll describe my process in some detail; in practice I don't necessarily follow all these steps unless I have lots of time and I'm not coming up with anything good just off the top of my head.<br/><br/>What I tend to do is to look at what the players have created (whether as prep or in play, by making decisions, taking action, and holding certain positions) and then combine those things in different ways. I often do this randomly; I find the randomness solves "blank page" syndrome and gives me ideas quickly without leaving me feeling predictable.<br/><br/>So, first I'd look at what themes, ideas, and story elements are present in the material I'm working with. I'll take your example and tease out a few.<br/><br/>(This will seem rather academic, as an exercise, since I'm "showing my work", but in practice I can do this quickly and intuitively. I do enjoy making it into a little "game" for myself - it's a more fruitful and enjoyable form of "lonely fun" than just sitting there scratching my head trying to come up with "something good".)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" rel="nofollow">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><b>Monday, the sixth of May:</b><br/>Inspector Chan is sitting at a bar, cradling a glass of whisky, rolling the ball of ice in it around while grimacing through the sigarrete smoke filled bar.

[a little more flavour text follows]</p></div></blockquote>\nI've bolded what I see as significant elements, phrases, or words in there; things that could be mined.<br/><br/>What can I glean from this short writeup, then? What's important to Inspector Chan, and, more importantly, Inspector Chan's player? Here are the basic story elements present in the short text:<br/><br/>1. Senator Barckley, a corrupt politician who always gets away.<br/>2. His dead partner. (Although a lack of a name and any details suggests the player might not be too interested in this story element.)<br/>3. His daughters.<br/>4. His wife.<br/>5. Drugs (specifically cocaine) are poisoning the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>These are the primary elements I can see here; I'd mostly be working with these. These can give us fuel for basic, actionable Bangs. Great for a basic story and relatively simple developments.<br/><br/>I like to take a pair to create a Bang or new story development. <br/><br/>Like I said, combining them at random works just as well - almost any combination can be fruitful. There's no need to get too clever; the most obvious and immediate idea usually works, and then you can get clever in presenting it, if you like.<br/><br/>For instance, let's take the first combination possible, which is the first and second story elements - the Senator and the the dead partner.<br/><br/>What comes to mind first? The most obvious idea is that the Senator is directly responsible for the death of the partner. Simple and easy: <br/><br/><b><i>Inspector Chan finds some new evidence which shows that his partner was murdered by the Senator, in cold blood. <br/></i></b><br/><br/>That's already interesting, because we get to see what kind of emotional response the Inspector will have to this new piece of information, but not the best Bang in the world, because he could just ignore it. <br/><br/>Dressing it up will make it more fun. What kind of murder? Why? What kind of evidence is found, and under what circumstances?<br/><br/>Perhaps the partner died precisely because he stumbled across some further nastiness the Senator was engaged in, and so he had to be killed. The Senator killed him in some particularly unnecessary cruel way, perhaps. (This would be easier if we had more info - I'd be asking the player to tell me more about the death, ideally, and then riffing on that.)<br/><br/>Or, it could be a more twisted connection. Was the Senator involved in some criminal activity, beyond what we know? Maybe he ran an illegal fighting ring, and the dead partner was obsessively involved with it, hiding that fact even from the Inspector? <br/><br/>Better yet, though, is to combine it with something else we already have on the table - one of the other elements. I simply take them in order. Is it the Inspector's daughters (element #3)? Then we learn that one of the daughters got caught up in some drug affair, and the partner sacrificed his life to save her. Or the wife (element #4)? Was there an affair between the wife and the dead partner, and the murder was a way to cover that up? Or the drugs (element #5)? Perhaps the dead partner got addicted to some terrible narcotic, to the point of ruining his own life, and committed suicide as a result, when he couldn't pay his debts?<br/><br/>So, that's what I get from the first pairing - elements 1 and 2. I could next try 1 and 3: Senator Barckley and the daughters. What's happening here? Perhaps one of them applying for a fancy scholarship, or aiming for some other important life goal... and the Senator is one of the people who decides whether she is chosen for that goal. Let's say the Inspector's daughter, Olivia, has dreams of getting admitted to a famous arts school, and the Senator's letter of reference is the only thing which will get her admittance. <br/><br/>So, that's another example of an idea:<br/><br/><b><i>Olivia asks her father to go to have dinner with the Senator, and convince him to write a reference letter for her. The Senator, of course, expects the Inspector to drop this investigation and to apologize to him before he will do any such thing.</i></b> <br/><br/>You can hopefully see how any combination of elements suggests something interesting. "Daughters" + "drugs" tells me that one of his daughters is involved in the drug world herself, and maybe even starts to see the Senator as a role model instead of her father.

Here's what I see on a quick read-through:<br/><br/>A. Barckley has gotten away three times - perhaps the "rule of three" is significant here, and can be a theme to play on. Pretty minor, though.<br/>B. "Procedural mistakes" suggests two themes to me. The first is incompetent authorities, perhaps even pointless bureaucracy, getting in the way of justice (if it's a question of error and incompetence on behalf of the "good guys"). The second is the idea of corruption - it's not the authorities are incompetent, but that they aren't "good guys" at all. This feels pretty juicy.<br/>C. Inspector Chan's growing distance/dissociation from his family. They stand in opposition to his work and his call of duty. This suggests that we want to juxtapose these two and force the Inspector to choose between them.<br/>D. There is definitely a theme of "forgiveness" in there - when does someone move on from a crime or misdeed?<br/>E. The general theme of sacrifice is hinted at a lot, as well - the sacrifice of time, family, loved ones, and even someone's life in the pursuit of justice, a career, or the greater good.<br/><br/>These can be randomly combined with each other or with the basic story elements, as well. For instance, (4) "wife" +  (D) "forgiveness" suggests some development where the Inspector must choose whether to forgive his wife, or vice versa - does she blame him for his partner's death for some reason? Or blame him for her daughter's drug addiction? <br/><br/>To take another random example, what about (2) and (B)? How is the dead partner involved in a theme of incompetent authorities? Perhaps we discover evidence that he died at the Senator's hands, as we discussed earlier, but some legal loophole means that this evidence isn't admissible in court. Or, taking the second theme in there - the "good guys" aren't "good" after all - we learn some dark news about the partner or the events that caused his death. Maybe the police chief who assigned Chan and his partner to a case had him set up. Let's type that one up, quickly:<br/><br/><b><i>The Inspector discovers that the circumstances under which his partner died were set up by the chief of the police (the Inspector's boss). Is he working for the Senator? Was Chan supposed to die, as well, but got lucky? What will he do with this knowledge, and is his own boss actually likely to try to get him killed again?</i></b><br/><br/>Coming up with the particular details is always the fun part, of course. Maybe the police chief sends him on a dangerous mission with a new partner who is clearly just there to make sure the Inspector definitely doesn't escape alive this time, for instance. That will lead the Inspector to suspect his own superiors and have to question his own loyalty to the police force. <br/><br/>I see I bolded "the school gate" in there, as well. It's mostly a colour element, but I could use it as the location of a Bang or a scene (e.g. the Inspector catches his daughter buying drugs when he picks her up at school) or as a hint that the school life/situation is important to the story in some deeper way. Focusing on the neighbourhood and what that means to the Inspector and his family might be another topic or theme which might be of interest.<br/><br/>I hope these examples are helpful; I'm really more interested in the process than the specific outcomes. I usually have more to work with than a paragraph of text, so this would be more personalized in the context of an actual game. (For instance, the personalities of the players, their interests, story elements invented by other players, the genre and other story conceits - are we inspired by film noir, here, or black comedy? - and the game mechanics might all suggest other things. For example, if the Inspector's character sheet listed an interest in Boxing or Journalism, those would give me other elements to build into this, as would another player character who was a sex worker looking to escape a tortured life, or another player character who was into demon summoning - you can imagine how any of those would give new material and new possible combinations of elements and ideas to craft further Bangs, scenes, or story developments.)<br/><br/>Combining story elements or themes across multiple characters/players is when it gets really fun. What if the other PCs were a cultist learning about accessing otherwordly power and a sex worker down on her luck and fighting for her rights? You can easily imagine how combining "the Inspector's daughter, Olivia", "demon summoning", and "sex work" would generate some ideas almost instantly... well, the Bangs pretty much write themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483012/#Comment_483012" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-07T23:57:52+00:00" title="May  7, 2019 11:57PM">May 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love how a concept-proving thread on what newbie-friendly, easy-access, perennial discussion threads might look like inevitably turns into an advanced GM technique seminar.

Writing a "Bang" is supposed to really speak to the player's interests and present a non-obvious choice which can't just be ignored (without interesting implications, anyway!) - that's a much more involved process. "Bangs" are supposed to go with Sorcerer's Kickers, and an already developed and nuanced fictional scenario. Part of the issue is that the examples posted weren't complete Kickers just yet, making it hard to write good Bangs based on them.<br/><br/>Again, the thread I linked does a better job of showing the process, so I'd recommend that as 'required reading' on this topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483196/#Comment_483196" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-11T17:26:14+00:00" title="May 11, 2019  5:26PM">May 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so I think the idea here is a cool one, but we're kind of stuck on the BANG.
