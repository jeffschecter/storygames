I sold out of copies of Uml\xe4ut: Bootleg Edition.  I am really, really happy about that, that's 25 copies of the game hopefully in the hands of people who're going to play it and give me the feedback.  There's a bribe for people who feed back in that they get the \xa36 they paid for the bootleg off the finished game when that comes out next year.<br/><br/>While the objective isn't and never was to make money and sell a lot of copies, I figure the more copies I sell, the more chance I have of getting that killer feedback which is going to make the game the best it can be when the finished thing goes to print next year.<br/><br/>So here's my thinking:<br/><br/>1) The original 25 copies were (for the most part) printed at the local University print service very cheaply.  I can't remember the actual costs, but it was really cheap.  Then there was the cover, which is in colour and cost slightly more.  Then there are the cards, which cost a bit more.  And the binding strips, which I bought at Staples.  I bound the books myself using a machine at work.  They were relatively cheap, but all of that was pretty backbreaking, and to be honest I'd rather not do it again.  So in short, no more hand made copies of the game.<br/><br/>2) I had been intending to write a short bit to add at the end of the book which contains design notes, optional rules and playtest information.  Originally I was going to include that at the end of the book, but then thought that maybe it ought to be separate from the main book.  The original idea was: here is the game, over here are some things I want you to pay particular attention to when you test it, here's another section of design notes so that you can see where I'm coming from with the game and finally, here are some extra optional rules which you might want to test out too.  I decided to leave that out of the Dragonmeet edition and post it on the website as a download.<br/><br/>3) There seemed to be some enthusiasm for the Ashcan from people world wide.  So if I make it available it'll have to be obtainable to people outside the UK.<br/><br/>Adding all that together, I seem to have two clear plans of action available to me.<br/><br/>Plan A is to sit back and see what feedback I get from the copies I sold at Dragonmeet.  This seems a bit, I dunno, fatalistic.  There's a good chance I won't get the level or quantity of feedback I need from that.  I feel like I need to be a bit more active in this.  So I'd like to make the ashcan available more widely.<br/><br/>The current plan B is to make the game book available via Lulu, but limit it's accessibility.  That is, not make it show up in searches or anything, I really want to keep a lid on the sales of this version.  I mean, ideally I'd handle the sales of the book myself, but realistically that's not going to happen.  So I think I can create the book, set the price and then sell it to the people who express interest here or via email.<br/><br/>Is there interest in that?  Does anyone want it, for a start?  Are there any dangers to making this version available in this way?<br/><br/>Basically, I'm trying to judge whether I should do this or not.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113224/#Comment_113224" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T04:48:05+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  4:48AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rich, congratulations (air guitar)!<br/><br/>I'm all confused now.

The best intentions of everyone often go astray, and buying a game on the understanding that you'll play it and tell the author how it went seems simple, but I dunno man.  I spoke to a lot of people who were like "yeah! awesome!" at the coin and that's great to hear, but at the end of the day, if they don't actually get time to run the game or feed back to me that doesn't make them evil or lazy, it just never happened for them.  Life's like that.<br/><br/>(Also, I think that timing was less than ideal.  I mean the con is just before Christmas and people are all gearing up for the December slow season and gaming understandably takes a back seat for a lot of people this time of year.  So possibly this was the worst time to try something like this, I mean, in 6 weeks when everyone gets back to gaming properly are they going to remember that wicked cool game that guy wants them to tell him about?  Or that might be wrong, I mean I might just be being paranoid.)<br/><br/>There's also the international issue. Everyone who has the Bootleg edition is someone who was in London that day.  So almost entirely people from England.  It would be nice to get a more varied base of gamers to get feedback from.<br/><br/>And, themain point (and the main reason I'm thinking of doing this) is that there are probably people who want to get involved with the game and this whole process who weren't at Dragonmeet.  More people involved = more feedback, right?  More feedback = better and = a more solid game at the end of the process. (To a point. I mean, if I was getting more feedback than I had time to usefully use that'd be a different thing, but realistically I really doubt that'd happen.)<br/><br/>I'm not talking about driving at large quantities of sales here, that's not going to help anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113226/#Comment_113226" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T05:05:35+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  5:05AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2007 5:06AM by Tim_Gray.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would there be any mileage in getting a "partner in crime" in the US and giving them a small stock of Lulu copies to send out to particular people, while you handle it in the UK?<br/><br/>Or set up a Yahoo group with privacy settings so the draft version is available to members only in PDF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113227/#Comment_113227" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T05:16:46+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  5:16AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you worked up another dozen and got them over here, I bet your state-side friends could distribute them pretty easily.
