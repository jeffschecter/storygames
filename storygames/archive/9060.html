Two characters have started showing symptoms, and three have not. They are on their ship, and the doctor on board will likely order them to stay on board until they can determine to what they've been exposed. I haven't really decided where this is going.<br/>\nSo I am thinking of where to take this: <br/>\n1. Let them stew and try to cure to the disease and RP the tension of being on the ship. <br/>\n2. Set up that the cure is somewhere, and it is a race to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like this is a good situation for role play and such, but I don't want to blow it with a lot of inaction and gaming "dead air"<br/>\nAny help from my fellow GMs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/seanhess" title="seanhess"><img alt="seanhess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/seanhess">seanhess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200246/#Comment_200246" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T18:58:38+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  6:58PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only do 1 if something happens in the meantime that they have to solve. Some people may know enough about medical drama to make that exciting, but if you're anything like me, trying to make that fun is going to flop. Give them something to do for sure. I vote either 2, or just have them move on with their lives with that looming over their heads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200539/#Comment_200539" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T20:51:35+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  8:51PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This idea comes from Andre Norton's great "Solar Queen" stories, which inform any Trader Ships in space style games.  They have some alien races in it, but that can be skipped over for a Firefly game.<br/><br/>What if what they have is just the symptoms and the idea is to mark the ship as a plague ship, subject to destruction if it approaches other ships of planets that it could infect.  They have to find proof that there is no disease. and get delisted as a plague ship (a hard thing to do).  In the meantime, ships will harrass and hound them, because they may need to try and land somewhere to get what they need.<br/><br/>To add to additional things to read to give you some Trader Ship style love, I would suggest Vance's new "Ports of Call" and "Lurulu", which have the kind of flim-flammery we expect of Jack...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
