The cliffhanger and previously ons are very consistently producing great fictional stuff for us all to grab onto. The self-policing of narration is working very well. I missed one of the changes to the 7.12 version, which is that extra moves cost 2 power tokens. I liked the flurry of extra moves we've been having and will miss them.<br/><br/>Aside from the Scene 2 transition I posted about in a separate thread, I'm not having too many bumps as a GM. Over the course of the alpha playtest I expect we'll see some really good info emerge about threat levels and how to push just hard enough to encourage derring-do and the like. Not having that down pat isn't really messing up play, but the games I've played don't make it much farther than the interludes, so I dunno how much it matters to be bumped and scraped at that point.<br/><br/>The other players in this game, John, John and Eric, all had a good deal of feedback of their own. I want to get out of the way and open the floor up to them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220774/#Comment_220774" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T09:35:48+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  9:35AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            early battle board for the Dark Rockets from Pluto<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t77/EricTLarsen/IMG_0476.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220778/#Comment_220778" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T09:55:46+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  9:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220796/#Comment_220796" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T12:14:32+00:00" title="July 26, 2009 12:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for running Matt!<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll post quick observations and fill in details by request.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe design, theme, feel of the game is spot on. Very enjoyable. Love character creation. Danger dice are fun. Enjoy most of the special powers. Using cliffhanger, previously ons, and interludes to foreshadow future threats was great. Total disasters are my favorite parts of the game! There is a lot more that I like but it\u2019s probably more helpful to go over areas we had problems or concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcerns:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Our game ended in a total party kill after 3 scenes; fight, interlude, fight. And my first character was vaporized after the first fight (I made a second character). Spawning new threats seemed like it can spin the threat level out of control. In the new rules, John gives advice against spawning new threats if there are already too many threats. So this could fix the problem. Maybe spawning threats could have a graded cost. Maybe 2 Danger spawns a minion threat that can only take 1 hit. 3 Danger spawns a threat that can take 2 hits and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It felt like a lost opportunity to roll 5 hits when you only need 3 and then have the 2 remaining hits do nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Helping was fun. But it sometimes felt like playing a priest in older editions of D&amp;D.; You help and then don\u2019t get to look cool yourself. One easy solution would be to allow overflow hits to count as helping dice that can be shared. Or now that it costs 2 power ups to do an additional action, maybe doing a support action only costs 1 power up.<br/>\n<br/>\n- My second character was a Psychic / Agent. Telekinesis as a power seemed out of place. Since we can narrate so many crazy things, it seemed strange to choose a power that lets me narrate more vs. a power as potent as Psychic Blast. It didn\u2019t seem like there was ever a reason to actually use Telekinesis. Unless there were elements in the environment that I could use to my advantaged with that power. Say throw someone off a cliff. Covert Ops also seemed like a strange ability. A group I lead uses my Agent trait to sneak and hide gets a bonus when they ambush. What does this mean mechanically? Are there rules for having a sneaking scene before a fight scene? Putting this power aside, what does an ambush mean? Is that me using my Agent trait before a fight to gain helping dice before the fight starts? It\u2019s unclear.<br/>\n<br/>\n- When Matt used Danger 1: Escalate the threat, it didn\u2019t feel threatening. Sometimes it was threatening but it didn\u2019t feel that way. A more dangerous feeling escalation would be ticking down count downs. If we have 5 rounds to save someone, escalate the threat by shortening how much time we have. Or add effects to an existing threat. Say make it so that the escalated threat becomes a staged threat and you have to deal with it first now before you can move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We wanted more power tokens! We loved our powers and wanted to use them more often. But that meant getting close to being vaporized. Which then led us to a total party kill. Maybe there is a way to gain a power token via an interlude scene?<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220802/#Comment_220802" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T12:31:56+00:00" title="July 26, 2009 12:31PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since we only played 2 fights, and both were climactic, it didn't seem like we had enough interludes to heal up.

I'm taking notes for the Beta version and this is all really helpful.<br><br>One quick comment: Vaporized does not have to mean actual character death, just a different adventure as the team goes into the 5th dimension to rescue you (or some other crazy mystical/scientific mumbo jumbo). That's why it's "vaporized" and not "dead." Of course, calling it death and making a new hero is fine, too.<br><br>Question: When Matt did Danger 1 Escalation, did he do the thing where that threat gains a point of mandatory Danger for all future rolls against it?

Great rule. The last fight scene was us trying to save my first character. But we all were KOed or vaporized. Hahahahahaha!<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt did use Danger 1 Escalation as you described above. He even placed a danger die on the escalated threat. And it was dangerous mechanically (we did get our asses kicked!). But it didn't feel dangerous because (I think, not 100% sure) we were able to determine the level of danger in many cases. Which was usually high.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's difficult to attribute what details led to which feelings since a lot of things were happening at the same time. For example, since we were overwhelmed with threats due to new threats spawning, escalating an existing threat seemed non threatening in comparison. But if it was a situation where we were fighting say 1 major threat, and then they were escalated, that might have been a different story and felt very dangerous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220814/#Comment_220814" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T13:51:15+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  1:51PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the artifacts in the picture.

Pacing beyond the fight scene was the most obvious confusion.  Jason's mention elsewhere of running it as intro-fight-outro feels like the best balance for the game in its present incarnation.  Which, makes it about a two hour game, and i don't think that's the intention.  Would love to give it another go-round with some examples of threat level pacing; and escalation limitations (our opening fight scene at times felt like it could have gone on forever.  again, it was awesome but probably not intended to dominate the rest of play.)<br><br>From my understanding, we played a hybrid between the first and second alpha.  We used single chip buys for extra turns.  In our game it provided more awesome and with the buys at present it seemed to have better pacing for events and powers.<br><br>Most of my wish-list for further iterations of the game are around the character mechanics.  My Alien Commando could have been played very similar the other two characters in the fiction.  My extra-dice flavor was for riffles and grenades, which was awesome.  I would have liked to have had maybe a list of a few Commando things i could have done per round at no cost that separated it from the other class/races.  It would have helped steer my fiction and reinforce the character.  True that further play would help me get used to the character and my color would become more individuated but having some guidelines would have kicked it over the top for me.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Two-tone Danger Patrol member tokens are a neat idea ... did anyone have trouble remembering anyone's character's name?</blockquote>\nMatt went overboard on the props.  It was incredible.  He glued the DP badges to some wooden craft counters and then handed them out to us and threw a box of crayons on the table for us to color our own counters in.  Surprisingly, we each colored the button differently... some splitting the lightning in half, etc.  Who doesn't like to kick off gaming with crayons?  the cloud was a vector drawing printed on purple paper stock.<br><br>Remembering names wasn't any easier or worse than any other short game.  It helped that our Robotron player (other John) spoke his IC voice into a hollow tumbler glass the entire game.  That was so great!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Total disasters are my favorite parts of the game!

Really wanted MORE MORE MORE total disasters.  The world could have been melting around us.  Not sure how that works mechanically yet.  I get that in the fiction you don't want the world to die or the office tower of crippled orphans to die but you have a somewhat arbitrary decision as to whether or not you're going to let that happen.  Curious if there could be a world clock tied to the total disasters (immediately the endgame in Roanoak comes to mind.)<br><br/>Overage in die rolls were a big issue with us.  My character had a buy power to spread the hits across the field but we house ruled that successful rolls could be fanned off to a nearby target.  That was a good solution for us.  The negative stuff all seems to have a zero sum total where everything nets out and it feels right that the positive should too.  I like John's idea to turn those overs into helper dice for the next round.  We didn't try it that way.<br/><br/>Power tokens and powers were big during play.  My position above is wanting some free buy powers that help me define class/race.  But maybe this could be solved also by just starting off the game with either a few more tokens in the bank or if the intro scenes provided some deeper play where you could generate Danger.<br/><br/>Anyway, Tons of fun.  Look forward to my next outing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
