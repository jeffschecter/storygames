One of my players is really into Techies.  You know, the guys who are the mechanics and tinkerers in the future.  I want to make up some Kewl Powerz for techies, but honestly I can't think of any.  We're playing a game sorta like Mechwarrior if you remember that RPG from back in the '90s, but honestly the system doesn't matter at the moment.  I just need some ideas for cool things techies can do.  <br/><br/>Some examples of what I'm thinking is how Han Solo bangs the bulkhead of the Millenium Falcon in Empire Strikes Back (I think) to get the electronics restarted, all the crazy things MacGyver pulled off in his show, or how Mr. Scott always pulled off a miracle in the origonal Star Trek series.  <br/><br/>If you guys have any experience playing these sorts of characters, share your ideas.  Even if it's only just snipets of actual play where your character did something cool, or a summary of a passage in a sci-fi novel you read that sticks with you as cool "techie" stuff.  I really appreciate your help.  I don't want this guy to be left out because the starfighter pilot and pistoleer have so many cool abilities of their own.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125707/#Comment_125707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T06:29:57+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  6:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of times, at least in the games I've played, the tech guys don't get the glory shots when combat rolls around. They hang out in the background while the pilots get all the thunder and lightning. That being said, here are some of my suggestions:<br/><br/>* Critical failure override -- The mech (or whatever) takes a critical hit, and it basically flatlines. Your techie is the only one who can get it operational again.<br/><br/>* Improvised weaponry -- Current munitions do nothing against this particular foe. Someone's got to come up with a special weapon that will destroy the enemy. Who will it be? The seductive space vixen? The cocky space captain? The enigmatic space chef? The... techie?<br/><br/>* Crazy bullshit con artist technobabble -- On Stargate SG-1, Carter (the resident brain) is always spouting some high-tech mumbo-jumbo, and the rest of the team is all like man what. This is never exploited! Primarily, this is due to the fact that Carter is an ethical person. What tripe. I say use this stuff to hypnotize people! Your techie can spit out a stream of incomprehensible terms and jargon like an indie gamer explaining Simulatious Drift to someone who doesn't even know what OBGYNS (or whatever) stands for. This can be used to access secured areas, get into exclusive nightclubs, meet with people who don't want to be met, and to obtain special, uh, stuff. Laser gun parts, or stuff of that caliber. You know what I'm saying here, I don't need to spell it out for you guys.<br/><br/>Damn, I miss coffee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125714/#Comment_125714" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T06:53:17+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  6:53AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2008 6:53AM by Anemone.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>* Crazy bullshit con artist technobabble</blockquote>\nIn a way, Kaylee uses this in the <i>Firefly</i> episode "Shindig", where she has a group of older rich aristocrats fascinated with her techie talk.

In effect, the ship's abilities are just an extension of the mechanic's abilities and no more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125930/#Comment_125930" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T07:49:41+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  7:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Eric's idea a whole lot.

I was more thinking of how the pilot player's rolls are modified by the awesomeness (or lack thereof) of the mechanic character.  The pilot's mech is definitively better just because the mechanic is better.  Like:</p>\n<p>No Mechanic = Mechs don't work<br/>\nCrappy Mechanic = Mechs move and fire.

And that's a gimmie for a pilot for your skill.  However... Hey Mechanic, did you actually refuel those jets, or were you hungover again?"<br/>\nMechanic:  "Uhhh... probably hung over <em>while</em> refueling.

You want to show whatever it is that the mechanic player wants to show about the character, in the behavior of the mecha. All you're proposing is that the mechanic could <em>block</em> the pilot, and that's interesting for a certain set of relationships between the characters, but given that this is Mechwarriorish, it's pretty much about success in the mission. That means that you want the guy to be able to do heroic stuff that's significant to the success of whatever's going on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125962/#Comment_125962" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T09:54:38+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  9:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2008 9:55AM by Eric Provost.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Block the pilot?  Well, that's not what I meant, but I suppose my example did lean that way.  Consider it again, but instead of the Mechanic player calling for the roll the GM is the one calling for the roll.  The GM calls on the mechanic player to roll for refueling instead of calling on the pilot's piloting skill.  Then it's a spotlight shift instead of pilot vs. mechanic.</p>\n<p>or...</p>\n<p>Pilot: "I'm gonna jump this mech across the ravine!"<br/>\nGM:  "You has no jump jets!"<br/>\nMechanic:  "Oh yes he does!"  [insert potential does-he-have-jump-jets conflict here]</p>\n<p>But I happen to like option 1 better.  Actually, I don't care if the mechanic doesn't get to roll during a combat.  The mechanic can shine in other scenes while being an important cog in the system that lets the pilot shine during combats.  But that's what I like.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
