I really like this game, it's neat and does exactly what it says on the box.<br/><br/>Basically my Kelly Perkins came to Mars to deal with delays in the terraforming, problems with social unrest (instigated by the Nazi-based Red Party) and a lack of education (in the form of propaganda and public awareness). At first she called on the support of Blue Party security forces to bust some heads and take down the troublemakers, but that just caused the Mars First movement to go further underground and strike back in secret. Amongst all this she's met up with her lover Evan Bao (we stole the name) who's a Red affiliated political reporter.  She managed to quell the social unrest by turning public opinion against Mars First. Then amongst the troubles of a new election and after some initial failures, she turned her hand to continuing the terraforming effort with great success (rolling 42 in one progress scene). She wasn't so lucky when it came to Education or the newly emergent troubles of Corruption and Funding. In the end, the Red and the Blue parties joined to become the New Mars Alliance, cut off any chance the Greens had at continued power, cut off ties to Earth and the Earth Coalition and started building up their industrial and military aspects. Kelly was sent home in shame, having earlier rejected a marriage proposal from Evan and seeing him engaged near the end of the story. I'm sure I missed some stuff there. Basically Kelly started off cracking down with security forces and that cascaded down into eventually giving the Red Party the balance of power. She managed to set up the terraforming of the planet and in the end she was lauded as a scientist but not much else.<br/><br/>What was really interesting about the game was that because it was played internationally over the internet, the political concerns and fears of our two different countries are very different. What was an issue for Joe wasn't one for me and vice versa.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Joe's, I don't remember as well (and he'll be in here to explain at one point). The only one that came into play dealt with the government selling off the natural resources. Basically his fears weren't issues at all here in Australia, and mine weren't issues at all in Canada.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303395/#Comment_303395" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T08:06:21+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  8:06AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite><cite>Posted By: David Pidgeon</cite>IThen amongst the troubles of a new election and after some initial failures, she turned her hand to continuing the terraforming effort with great success (rolling 42 in one progress scene).</blockquote>\n42 in one scene!
