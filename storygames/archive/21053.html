This featured a clash resolution system where different techniques could auto-defeat certain other techniques based on category, resulting in a good deal of tactical technique picking, but would fallback to a "clash roll off" where an auto-defeat didn't occur.<br/><br/>Ben Lehman's Polaris has its spoken key phrase-based conflict which is a combination of player negotiation and resource management, but falls back, again, to a dice roll when the protagonist decides not to compromise.<br/><br/>Can anyone think of examples that don't rely on randomization at all? In particular, any that you particularly enjoy?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461905/#Comment_461905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-12T22:37:22+00:00" title="April 12, 2017 10:37PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FateStorm's system is pure bidding.

I've been considering resource management combat systems but I'm not quite to a point where I have a design I'm fond of.<br/><br/>I've got a game that features no stochastic randomness that I'm currently testing in an early access called <a href="http://games.kyleweems.io/deadpuncher/" rel="nofollow">Deadpuncher</a> (currently costs a small amount $2.99, not trying to do a salesman plug I swear). Inspired by Burn Legend and Yomi, it operates like this: characters have access to maneuvers from fighting styles they learn, essentially in a small deck-building exercise. At the start of each round they select a target and a maneuver, then compare maneuver choices. Opponents compare Sign tags to determine if one trumps the other, and if not they compare static stat-based Speeds to determine who succeeds or fails. Consequences from cards then occur, with a Risk-management system where you can opt to take a lower-level Injury immediately (and therefore keep your Risk low) or accept points of Risk being placed into a pool. Finisher maneuvers can convert the stored Risk into much greater Injuries, potentially ending the fight immediately.<br/><br/>I'm still in the testing phase, and it's not exactly a tersely-worded system, but so far I feel like it's encouraging complex emergent strategies between opponents after they learn one another's styles (with each fighting style having its own ratio of tags and counters to consider) and allows for fairly fast round-by-round resolution (I put this together to playtest a combat engine for a moderately sized LARP in mind of theater-style LARPers who prefer a strategic combat system over a more narrative negotiation system). <br/><br/>But having drank the kool aid, as it were, I'm definitely looking into other ways to handle combat that maintains strategic depth while removing the swing of die rolls and still allows for easy-to-memorize and quick resolution rules for each round.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461931/#Comment_461931" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T15:58:25+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  3:58PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does anyone have any feedback to offer on token-bidding games as to quality or fun of play or emergent complexity for tactics from the rules?</blockquote>\nI've played Undying, which is all token-bidding. I didn't play very much, but I got a feel for the mechanics. I found them really fun! The specifics of Undying's economy kinda pushes you in the direction of a downward spiral for your Humanity score, but I'm pretty sure that's a feature, like Urban Shadows' Corruption spiral. I definitely felt there was an element of complexity and an ability to "get good" at managing the economy, but I don't think it was built for tactics, as fighting is really just a small but intense part of the game's intended action - not really what you're looking for, but I think a pretty decent example of tokens being a successful/fun alternative to luck mechanics.<br/>(if you want to check it out yourself, an artless version of Undying is available through creative commons from the designer's own website)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461932/#Comment_461932" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T16:09:28+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  4:09PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll check out <b>Undying</b>, thanks for mentioning it!<br/><br/>I'm not looking for any one specific thing, as much as I'm doing more research on non-random combat system styles in general to get a feel for what's out there and to become inspired by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461934/#Comment_461934" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T17:08:49+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  5:08PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Undying is really elegant, definitely recommended.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461935/#Comment_461935" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T20:04:54+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  8:04PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everway's combat system?

I agree with you that it doesn't have any sort of PvP arbitration guidance, and I could see arguments occurring in such a situation due to room for interpreting moves.<br/><br/>Which means it's probably not the right game to play with a game crew that is looking for that sort of play style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462011/#Comment_462011" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T15:24:15+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  3:24PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The King is Dead/Firebrands... most of the fighting subsystems have no randomization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462012/#Comment_462012" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T15:56:14+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  3:56PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The King is Dead/Firebrands... most of the fighting subsystems have no randomization.</blockquote>\nCare to elaborate on its mechanics and how it handles fighting?

I especially recommend having a swordfight early in your first game: the intimacy of it (just two people involved, their lives potentially at stake) helps drive home the point more easily than in a skirmish, with all those other named extras involved. However, a swordfight does include some randomness in the form of flip-a-coin options, unlike a skirmish.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462046/#Comment_462046" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-17T14:35:07+00:00" title="April 17, 2017  2:35PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like good advice!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462051/#Comment_462051" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-17T16:50:10+00:00" title="April 17, 2017  4:50PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like I may need to buy <b>Firebrands</b> it to dig in deeper to check that out!<br/><br/>Which is the real risk of seriously geeking out on RPG system research.
