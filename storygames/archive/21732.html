No idea how to get my hands on it so far, still looking for a copy here -in spanish if possible (seems it has been translated or at least the book does)<br/><br/>The second one is a mixed media RPG called <a href="https://weave.game/" rel="nofollow">Weave</a> that works both with a deck of it's own and an app. You pick and scan the cards with your smartphone to get a few choices to make a character, which are then sent to the Narrator's phone to create the story. They even programmed four different settings: a cyberpunk, there's a Goonies-like one, a flash-gordon like one and the last is a high-school. I also like that you play with the app open in your smartphone, so no more it's a distraction from to game but actually part of the game.

There are five suits, four of which correspond to the games four ability scores and the fifth, Doom, which when the PCs play them the GM can hoard and use against them later on. <br/><br/>It's a fairly simple target number system; each card has a numerical value, added to your score, and if the suit matches the ability for a specific action you add the top card of the deck as well.<br/><br/>Each card also has an <i>Event</i> (like Hazmat Leak, Achilles Heal, Compromising Information), a <i>Calling</i> (in the superhero sense: Mentor, Protector, Soldier, and cetera), a famous Marvel universe <i>character</i> that appears on the card, and an <i>Aura</i> (I can't remember what Aura actually does). In the group I learned the game from, we routinely were throwing out cards to invoke their Events, Callings, and Characters and introduce those elements to the game, or to add extra oomph to a negation with the GM when we wanted to pull something off (for example, if the Calling on a card matched the intent of a player's action).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475337/#Comment_475337" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-13T13:14:05+00:00" title="July 13, 2018  1:14PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great!

I mean, these games are great but didn't seem to have the impact I would have expected. Were the images too complex? Does it still generate blank page syndrome? Was it the procedures to use the deck the actual problem? <br/><br/>Some common problems seem to be that the cost of producing these decks made the game too expensive, or that the game concept sounded too unfamiliar for an audience expecting more of a trad game. Some other opinions mentioned the procedure not clicking for them, hence my guess of the images not being clear enough, and often requiring a guide book to interpret the card meanings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475346/#Comment_475346" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-14T14:07:35+00:00" title="July 14, 2018  2:07PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Everway play (both from our long running games and observations of others) it's easy to play lazy.

That's why I was looking for something a bit more like a rorschachlike deck, something that would suggest themes and characters more related to the game theme. <br/><br/>Like, Archetype Cards work quite fine for fantasy, especially if you combine any two to make a character. Vision Cards from Everway seem great too, I'm used to look for images in pinterest to spark my inspiration. Plus, I'd really like to get more ideas for powerful engaging stories. There's still a few cards of the tarot that are hard to interpret as really dramatic stuff unless you're used to it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475565/#Comment_475565" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-20T20:58:26+00:00" title="July 20, 2018  8:58PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The decks based on the Rider-Waite deck all have pretty standard interpretations that you can use alongside/instead of interpreting the images. I ran a game of Nobilis once where, since I couldn't live without a randomizer, I used an online tarot card website to help me come up with content, NPC reactions, etc.  That was handy because it shows the picture of the card as well as the standard interpretation. It was a lot of fun!                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475568/#Comment_475568" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-21T08:59:40+00:00" title="July 21, 2018  8:59AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dixit has a lot of beautiful cards that could help.

They\u2019re 36 cards that show fairly straightforward symbols like a man, a ring, a flower, a letter, a house. The meanings are mostly pretty literal. Much less deep than tarot, but also less ambiguous.
