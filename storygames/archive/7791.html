I\u2019ve not played it yet, but I\u2019ve been reading through the play reports while waiting for the opportunity to order myself a copy.  It seems, from the reports, an unequivocal work of genius.  What fascinates me most, however, is the limited scope of its background.  60 days.  Period.  No matter how many times you play, you\u2019re still playing within the same 60-day window.  :mindboggle:<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore coming across the idea of story games I would not have thought such a brief window could inspire much in the way of a game \u2013 a single scenario, sure.  Now, though, I find myself wondering what other time periods (read Antiquity, which I enjoy far more than WWII) this framework might apply to \u2013 especially in terms of re-playability and the verisimilitude of scenario ideas within the window in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould the structure of <i>Grey Ranks</i> work, say, in a more combat-oriented simulation?  Perhaps in a game based around the Battle of Thermopylae, with characters as allied Greeks or Spartan helots?  Or perhaps around the Athenian siege of Syracuse, where characters are young Athenian soldiers coping with savage hand-to-hand fighting, disease, and the horrors of an eventual defeat?  The possibilities seem endless, but how much does our shared history of WWII play into the audience\u2019s appreciation (enjoyment?) of the game?  Is Antiquity too remote for the same emotional response to be felt by modern players?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case: bravo, Jason!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nScott                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172747/#Comment_172747" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T04:30:29+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  4:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the praise!  You should look at Frederik Jensen's game <a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Montsegur 1244</i></a>, which is shares a similar intense focus with <i>Grey Ranks</i> but is otherwise a completely different and more awesome animal.  <br><br>I know the structure of <i>Grey Ranks </i>could be ported to other settings - the key ingredients are the intersection of coming-of-age and total war.  I hadn't considered antiquity but it would probably work just fine (my top three:  Berlin '45, the Baltic states '52, Lw\xf3w '18).  I think there is something to be said for familiarity - we all know what a mid-century city in central Europe is "supposed" to look like, we're all familiar with the tools with which the second world war was fought.  But beyond that stuff, which is easy to provide, I think the underlying themes are pretty timeless.

You'd mentioned in another thread that you were on the verge of reprinting <i>Grey Ranks</i>.  Any clue when that will be?  If it's going to be a while I'll go ahead and order a copy today . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, thanks for the link to <i>Montsegur 1244</i>!  That sounds like another game right up my alley.  I'm torn, though, between experimenting with a story game concept or writing something more traditional based on my own novels (two ancient historical, one historical sword-and-sorcery).  I guess I could combine the two: a story game concept based upon my own IP.  Ack!  Indecision . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I like the notion of the Athenian siege of Syracuse in 415-413 BC; the characters will be rather older than in <i>Grey Ranks</i> (I believe the absolute youngest soldier in the invasion force would have been 20 -- the youngest age class and the eldest would have stayed behind as part of the "Home Guard"), and in some ways they were far more accustomed to war than we are now, especially as the expedition to Sicily occured during the second phase of the Peloponnesian War, after the Plague Years at Athens.  It might be hard to intersect coming-of-age with total war in a Greek setting.

No matter how much you as the designer is in love with the place, time, conflict and juicy details, this must come across to the players as an experience that they can relate to with little up front effort. The story that will drive the players into your game world is based on human experiences that span the eons: love, war, growing up, the lot. Carefully decide where the players can bring their own creative energy to the table. Too many details and the players will be afraid to improvise and take creative ownership of the story. Too few details and you get a generic, archetypical story.<br><br>The trick I use in Montsegur 1244 is to make template characters that covers children, teenagers, adults and old people of both sexes, building a society with timeless content such as family relations, love, war, death, adultery, envy, treasure, obedience, religion, child birth.<br><br>If you want to do a war story, then think of why you want to do a war story in ancient Sicily rather than in WWI or II?

The tropes you mention (Honor, Bonding, Longing, Fear, Pain, Death) all would work great in a setting based on ancient Greek warfare.  The only one missing from the list is Glory.  Having Glory attached to ones name was the way to alleviate the otherwise bleak Greek afterlife, and it often spurred men on when Fear, Pain, and Death sought to hobble them.  It didn't always work, of course.  But that dynamic of Death vs Glory has long fascinated me (it was the theme of my first novel).<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably I would choose exploring the ramifications of war in an ancient setting over one more modern because, through self-interest and professional research, I <i>understand</i> ancient warfare better.  But, your points, and Jason's, are well-taken.  There must be room in the design for each player to take ownership of the story.  I very much like the notion of character templates -- would something like the oracles from IAWA work equally well?  "A young Athenian soldier, untested, pining for Glory", that sort of thing?  Then give the players what tools they'll need to flesh out the skeleton.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason: unfortunately, in hoplite warfare there's not much a non-combatant <i>can</i> do.  Even light troops, such as slingers and archers, were generally highly-trained.  This particular siege started with an amphibious assault on Syracuse, an ally of Sparta, that gained the Athenians little; to my recollection, the Athenians never breached the city's walls, nor ever fully blockaded the harbor; starving them out was impossible.  Both sides fought a ground war over the small fort that commanded the heights above the city (complete with night assualts and the building of walls and counter walls).  Finally, the Spartans sent a single man who whipped the Syracusans into shape and led them against the demoralized, diesease-ridden, and poorly-led besiegers.  It ended in complete disaster for the Athenians; what few men survived the battle were kept as slaves in the quarry of Syracuse until they died or were ransomed.  This defeat probably hastened Sparta's victory over Athens.  I like the idea of telling the story from the Athenian POV, as tragedy makes for the best drama, though this was before the days of great herds of camp followers so the soldiers' POV would be the default.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I'm toying with where my books are concerned -- just the most recent, actually: it's due out in early 2010 from Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press -- is a story game that fills in the blanks, so to speak, of the novel.  The book is "historical sword-and-sorcery" set in Cairo in roughly 1169 AD, Robert E. Howard-inspired with overtones of the Arabian Nights and ancient Egyptian sorcery.  The book takes place over a five day span of palace coups, civil unrest, the approach of two hostile armies, and a looming siege.  Perforce, it chronicles the deeds of the great.  What if the game version followed the lives of the people in the streets during the same five day window?  Cairo teems with people of all sorts, and their personal stories would be legion.  It might be the way to go . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I'm rambling <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  Thanks, once again, to both of you.
