Holy Shit...how is this game not already on everyone's radar.  <br/><br/>The Prologue is quite possibly the single best introduction I've ever read in an RPG book!  Not as in "introduction to how to roleplay" but "introduction to what this game is about and the mind space we envisioned when we wrote it".  I tried to do something similar for Blood Red Sands which I hope people besides me think is as good as I think this one is.<br/><br/>And the cultures are incredibly interesting...and easily one of the best presentations of RPG cultures I've read...stories and legends and history all blurred together with enough talent to be fun to read and just loaded with potential character conflicts.  I mean when you have a culture that stole the secret of metalurgy from the giants and then managed to defeat the giants in a war because their women fought alongside them but only the male giants fought, so they only had to defeat half as many.  That's a pretty cool story in itself.  But when you then spin off from their that the women giants are still around but without any male giants (who were all killed) they can only bear children by tricking men lost in the wilderness and giving birth to half giants...making for an instant boogie man (er...boogie woman?) in the form of Motherings who take wayward males in some kind of mythical version of the movie Misery, that's awesome.  And when you then derive an entire cultural tradition of shrouding metal working in the deepest secrecy because they need to keep the giant kin from stealing the secret back...that kind of stuff just makes me want to totally play in that world.  And that's like 2 pages out 100ish of stuff like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mattastic" title="mattastic"><img alt="mattastic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/ldwgS.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mattastic">mattastic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338416/#Comment_338416" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T09:44:54+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  9:44AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also looking for a spot to buy the book...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338432/#Comment_338432" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T10:58:54+00:00" title="August 12, 2011 10:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2011 10:59AM by Wordman.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: framweard</cite>Did anyone else back this project?</blockquote>\n(Raises hand)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>how is this game not already on everyone's radar.</blockquote>\nA year ago, I <a href="http://divnull.com/blog/2010/kickstarter-early-dark/" rel="nofollow">tried to spread the word</a>.

Only other option here was a settlement. )<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Step three - roll scenario and pick people in it:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n(The chart for this is on page 387, about 205 pages away from the previous charts)<br/>\n<br/>\n1d10 = 3 : "A thief gets caught stealing the jewels decorating the beard of a sleeping patriarch when someone walks in."<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, if you were playing with a group, you'd all pick people to be in this scenario. Since it's just me, I'll just pick one person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll go with the thief, since that seems to be cool way to start a myth - in deep trouble. Now thieving for a Vayok would be unthinkable - they just grab swords and duke it out when disagreeing, or go have a chopping other people's heads off contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there must be a reason that my char can't just have a fight. Hey, he'll be just a kid - his daddy killed this serious bad evil warrior chief. Died himself a few minutes later, but turned the tide of the battle. Patriarch picked up the necklace from the dead bad guy after it was all over. Kid figures it should belong to him. Challenged the patriarch to a duel for it. Patriarch laughs and tells him to wait a couple years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the kid sneaks into the Patriarch's long house in middle of the night. Big common sleeping area. He takes the necklace off the sleeper, turns to leave, and finds one of the Patriarch's kid daughters is awake. She looks at him for a long moment, then deliberately closes her eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe bugs out of there. Out under the stars he realizes everybody's going to know he took the necklace. Decides to run away<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Step four - "Milue" (cultural subgroup)</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going for "Vayok Urban". As I tick stuff off here, I get fixed attributes that can't be changed later in character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAptitudes:<br/>\nUrban- 5 Relate<br/>\nMale- 1 Thrive (so I'm gonna be terrible at that the whole game)<br/>\nYoung- 4 Move<br/>\nHeritage: Khazil - 2 Guile (I think I'm Khazil, not sure that's the name foreigner's call us, usually for Vayok living far from home. )<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment:<br/>\nClan Kimi [1 Investment] (No clan names list, that I remember, so I'm making on up.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Step five - pick some additional alignments</b><br/>\n<br/>\n(out of six choices:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRomance (with the girl)<br/>\nRivalry (with the patriarch)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Step six - stat up remaining Aptitudes:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI get to put 12 points worth among the four remaining Aptitudes<br/>\n<br/>\nCunning 4<br/>\nFight 3<br/>\nTouch 3<br/>\nLabor 1 - (not this kid's style!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Step seven - calculate traits</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where I got lost the first time. On careful reading I see that the chart here on page 212 for calculating these doesn't say what aptitudes apply to each trait. It's listed on the char sheet at the end of the book. So I'm going to be bouncing around.<br/>\n<br/>\nTacks per Turn: 4 from 4 cunning.<br/>\nDamage per Die: 1 from 3 Fight<br/>\nInvestment Renown Limit: 4 from 5 Relate (this one's explanatory text  confuses me)<br/>\nUpkeep discount: 0 from 2 Guile<br/>\nGuard: 15 from  1 Thrive (hello, terrible)<br/>\nInitiative: +2 from  3 Touch<br/>\nGround: 5 from 1 Labor (ouch)<br/>\nRolls per Round: 3 from 4 Move<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Step eight - calculate secondary traits</b><br/>\n<br/>\nVest Capacity: 5 from 5 ground. (this is how  much stuff I can carry in combat)<br/>\nTotal Capacity: 10 from 2x Vest Capacity. (how much I can lug while walking)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStep nine - Dice<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this page confused me, until I took it really slow.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Heroes all start with 4 dice in each Domain. Players spend 7 further Stars to purchase additional Dice according to the chart at the bottom of the page."<br/>\n<br/>\nMundane: 8<br/>\nArcane: 4<br/>\nLoom: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA box now tells me to begin the campaign with:<br/>\n4 Raw Arts<br/>\n4 Wounds<br/>\n3 Guard Dice<br/>\nCreate Unarmed Fighting Style<br/>\n4 Each Domain Dice (7 Stars) [I'm guessing this has already been taken care of]<br/>\n2 Talents Mundane or Arcane<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to work my way through these.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh. But first the section on arts tells me that:<br/>\nBlood equals 2 X Arcane Dice<br/>\nSo that's an 8 for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and there's this whole chapter about epitaphs now. But I haven't pick any of the above. Last time I tried for epitaphs and got confused, so I'll take care of the above, starting with arts, then come back to page 216<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Step ten - Arts</b><br/>\n<br/>\nArts start on page 290, FYI.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaw Animal Kinship (Relate-Touch) (page 294)<br/>\nRaw Armoring (Fight-Touch) (page 296)<br/>\nRaw Scouting (Move-Touch)<br/>\nRaw Protgony Magic family (Cunning) (page 336)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh wait.

The wolf Aglakti knew these hills, and preferred to walk on the familiar paths of the Vayok. It would be safer Aglakti thought, and easier to walk on.

The book is packed with ideas, and part of the character generation includes a list of starting situations sorted by which area of the world they take place in, which can easily be adapted for other purposes. There are tables of random encounters if you want to use them, based on the ecologies of various locations. The book also provides plenty of examples, including example characters. There is an entire chapter dedicated to discussing the game mechanics and how to use them as a GM.<br><br>As for difficultly of the system, I'd say it's on par with the One Role Engine. Some things seem a little more confusing on a quick read, but once you've read all the rules and thought about them for a bit, everything makes sense. Some of the rules are a bit more confusing than others (like Striking vs Fatiguing), but there aren't any huge obstacles to understanding the game.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CalvinAnthropos" title="CalvinAnthropos"><img alt="CalvinAnthropos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CalvinAnthropos">CalvinAnthropos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339718/#Comment_339718" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T22:27:34+00:00" title="August 19, 2011 10:27PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2011 10:28PM by CalvinAnthropos.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Early Dark creator here. Thanks for starting up the game! <br><br>I believe Early Dark as a whole speaks for itself, and I hope that any of the confusing parts became more clear after another reading. But, I'll trust your opinions if it seems things are still a bit tricky after a few tries. I would love to hear exactly what hiccups occurred during the character creation. We have a little wiggle room before the final proofs are set with the printers, so any suggestions that can make things smoother would be awesome! I love the two characters that have been posted so far, so it looks like you persevered. I especially like a new character taking the initiative and adding a couple extra alignments that fit in with the backstory. We haven't encountered chargen issues before, so I'm wondering if the format is the problem (scenarios in back, but milieus up front, navigating PDF) or if there is something that got lost during the final layout edits (sometimes things get "moved" and end up disappearing). <br><br>Maybe I can add a little blurb about the combat styles: Calculus did it just right. The character sheet used to just say "unarmed fighting style" but so many people wanted to name their styles. Eventually we took out the "gimme" stance and let them write in what they wanted.<br><br>I'm loving the feedback so far, and we always aim to make the game easy and enjoyable to play. <br><br>Anyway, I don't want to lurk around here and get in the way of people's candid reviews and opinions, but feel free to write me if you have ideas or suggestions. Framweard posted a nice correction on our forum, and things like that are always great to find. Jumping into the system is the fun part, and I can't wait to see how people take to combat in Early Dark, where creating situations/encounters is more fundamental than rolling up enemies. <br><br>Glad to have places like this.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339763/#Comment_339763" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T12:29:02+00:00" title="August 20, 2011 12:29PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calvin, I'm really excited by a lot of what I see in Early Dark.

The color writing is superb, and the situation-loaded character generation is really cool.<br><br>My bug with the PDF is the lack of a running example during chargen, and (as has been brought up above), some points in the writing where the mechanical explanation is ambiguous or assumes the reader has knowledge of an element that isn't actually described.
