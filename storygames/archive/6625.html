Let's call her, um, "A." <br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying "A" is <i>always</i> a big ol' Jerky McDisruptopants, but she does have <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6540" rel="nofollow">her moments</a>, and last night was another of them.<br/><br/>She loves playing characters with stealth. Who are loners. Who don't interact with anyone in the party in any material way, and who go off by themselves.<br/><br/>All the fucking time. A ninja, a scout, a ranger, whatever.  I don't mind the repetitiveness -- I tend to play the same rogue/bard over and over again myself -- but it's the anti-socialness, ICly, that I object to.<br/><br/>So last night, we're starting the campaign, and ...<br/><br/>MINOR SPOILERS FOR CURSE OF THE CRIMSON THRONE (Pathfinder #7) FOLLOW<br/><br/>...an NPC has arranged for all the players individually to meet at her house at sundown.  The monk goes there early, sits down lotus style, and starts meditating. For hours and hours. Kinda cool, I'm good with that.<br/><br/>"A" -- playing a ranger -- shows up, goes across the street, hides in a bush, and watches the monk for hours. Uh okay whatever.<br/><br/>The halfling rogue shows up just about on time, rolls well on her Spot check, notices the ranger. Drops down on her from above to say hello; "A" basically shoos her off and doesn't talk, roleplaying being anti-social. Uh okay whatever. The rogue goes over to annoy the monk.<br/><br/>The war cleric shows up, talks to everyone (except "A" who is still hiding across the street); the sorcerer shows up. They all knock, nobody answers, the monk tries the door. There's a note inside, saying "come on in, I'll be along shortly."  Everyone goes inside -- well, except "A", who sneaks up to listen at the door.<br/><br/>The NPC who owns the house and has gathered everyone comes down the road. "A" hides from her. She goes in, talks to the other players; there are 6 seats at the table -- one for each player and one for the NPC.  "A" stays outside, listening at the door. Someone asks about the extra seat; the NPC says she invited someone else, but apparently she didn't show. Halfling pipes up, "Oh, she's across the street, hiding in the bushes!"  "A" listens to this, still says outside.<br/><br/>NPC explains the plot, asks for the players' help; they agree to help. "A" is still outside, ear against the door, listening in.<br/><br/>NPC does a tarot card reading, for each of the four players who are in the house. "A" is still lurking outside. Players are told to write down the initial card drawn plus a number based on the card read. When all the card readings are done, <i>then</i> "A" decides she's going to come in.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147097/#Comment_147097" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T09:56:30+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  9:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            She walks into the house and goes up to the NPC and demands <i>her</i> reading now.  The NPC refuses, because she's done doing readings and is putting her cards away. Why'd the NPC refuse? Because for whatever reason, "A" decided to stay out of the building for the whole scene, so hey, if you're going to that much trouble, I'll respect your desire to write yourself out of the action.<br/><br/>"A" gets upset, in character and out of character, and says she's leaving now to go attack the bad guys' base (rather than in the morning, as the rest of the PCs had planned while they were all discussing it in the room, with "A" lurking outside). Everyone is feeling pretty uncomfortable, but dammit, I've invested money in this series of modules and I'm not going to see it ruined just because "A" is being pissy.<br/><br/>She's complaining; "I'm screwed out of something again! It always happens!" She's mad, at me, at the NPC, at everyone except herself, even though she set up the situation entirely and it was her own making. Sure, I could have had the NPC say "Oh, you're late, here's your card reading" -- but what can I really do if "A" makes it clear that her choice is not to participate with the rest of the group?  <br/><br/>Oh, by the way, it was "A's" apartment (with her RL girlfriend, the halfling rogue), so it's not really practical to throw her out of the game. "A" is muttering that she's going to go attack the place by herself and probably get killed, "but whatever, I'm screwed anyone, because she's being a bitch."  I ask who "she" is; "A" says she means the NPC. Riiiiiiiight.<br/><br/>The rest of the party, who were planning to attack in the day after scouting it out, take off after "A." She gets there first -- runs around trying doors, to find a way. Finally decides to jump in the river and see if she can find an alternate way to get in, via swimming.<br/><br/>Oops. There's a shark in the water.<br/><br/>"Great! I'm always screwed!" she says as the shark attacks her in the surprise round and misses. She keeps failing her swim checks to get back to shore; the shark keeps missing her; and "A" keeps complaining and complaining about how totally unfair this all is and why does she always get screwed over, and I am just trying to keep the game on track and have some fun with everyone else.<br/><br/>The other players help her out; the sorcerer summons a fiendish octopus that engages the shark long enough for "A" to make it to shore. Does she help or even introduce herself?  Hell no, she heads back to the front of the building and tries to break in another way.<br/><br/>Sigh.<br/><br/>The war priest's player is getting bothered and backing off from doing things, because there's too much tension in the air, too many angry people and the game isn't fun for him.<br/><br/>I know I didn't do anything wrong, although there were some things I could have done differently -- f'rex, I could have confronted her on her being an asshole. That wouldn't have been productive, although it at least would have replaced the uncomfortably silent tension with outright hostility.<br/><br/>I could have just had the NPC give her a tarot reading when she barged in, even if it didn't make sense to me. That would have kept her happy, especially as later in the module the specific cards drawn give bonuses on certain encounters and situations, but I don't think it's fair to the rest of the players or the integrity of the game to bail "A" out for being consistently, persistently, and determinedly anti-social but still get the game mechanics bonuses the rest of the players receive.<br/><br/>"A" could have come in at any time; by the time she finally did, I'd already decided she was too late. Why do these things keep happening to her? I dunno, maybe it's because <b>she sets up these situations and is horribly destructive to party unity again and again</b>? Nah, that couldn't <i>possibly</i> be it! I'm just picking on her.<br/><br/>I probably should have a talk with her before next game. Last night I was just too upset with her myself -- sort of a "what the fuck, why are you trying to mess up my new campaign already?" disbelief/anger -- to engage her productively on the way she was acting.<br/><br/>I really wish she'd stop all that nonsense, or if she's going to continue being Ms. Loner Nobodylikesme, at least have the guts to accept the consequences of deliberately avoiding the party formation scene.<br/><br/>Any advice on how to handle this situation?  I'm a pretty darned experienced DM, but I just haven't had the case before of a player who refuses to let her character integrate into the group and then gets upset at being "left out" in my 25+ years of running D&amp;D games. (God, I'm old.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147098/#Comment_147098" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T10:05:36+00:00" title="June  1, 2008 10:05AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

You know all that GM advice that says "don't railroad, if your players surprise you, go with what they do!" Ha ha, yeah. This is why that doesn't always work and make everyone happy.<br/><br/>- Was there any discussion about how people wanted their characters to interact with each other? I'm guessing no. This is not the same as a common character background or established relationships. It is "how I want your character to react to mine/see mine". Without any kind of planning, there's no way, never ANY way that she will get what she wants, the other players will know what she wants, or you will get what you want.  It's not too late to have this discussion!

I would recommend talking to her and trying to see if she is interested in playing with the rest of the group or if she is intent on being disruptive. I would admit your own anger and feelings. I would bring the social contract out front and center and let her know that the game requires her being on board if its ever going to be fun. And I would be clear that a lone ranger character is going to get toasted if they can't find a way to work with the group.

It wasn't my fault she was outside" stuff in your post. You hosed her. She deserved exactly what she got, but it wasn't a force of nature.

I still see that as a consequence of the same kind.<br/><br/><i>But I would recommend starting with ownership of the fact that yes, your boned her but good.</i><br/><br/>Honestly, I don't see it.  Can you explain what you mean here?  I was definitely angry with her, but I made sure to take breaks to let my anger cool off, and I did let her go off and do what she wanted, only for her to find that -- shocker! -- if a single character takes on a D&amp;D adventure designed for 4 characters, she'll get in over her head.<br/><br/>Again, I don't think of that as me trying to punish her. I gave her chances to get back into the group. I let the other PCs catch up with her, despite her insistence that she was running top speed the whole time and "they shouldn't even be here yet."  She kept rejecting each chance to get involved, and I'm confused as to why you think I was being vindictive.<br/><br/>NOTE:  I'm not saying that you're wrong. I'm saying I'd like to hear what makes you think I did something capricious to "bone" her. I am really curious -- because she obviously feels boned too, and I don't see it. And unless I understand how that boning worked, she and I won't see eye to eye.<br/><br/>So if I can use you as a proxy for "A" -- someone who thinks I hosed her but who isn't emotionally involved -- I may be able to see how to mend bridges.<br/><br/>(By the end of the session, they'd met the NPC again and she did offer "A" a reading at that point, which "A" reluctantly accepted.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147105/#Comment_147105" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T11:06:30+00:00" title="June  1, 2008 11:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>Why do these things keep happening to her?

That said, her behavior up to the tarot reading isn't disruptive particularly, it's just boring, and the reasons you give for the NPC to refuse to read for her are meta-game reasons - you're punishing her for being lame.  That's passive-aggressive and unproductive.  Hindsight is always 20/20, but nothing about her behavior up to that point precludes interesting play arising from her late entry to the room.  Since you're not prepared to kick her, and you haven't confronted the issue directly, this would have been a great time to "say yes or roll the dice."<br/><br/>Her behavior after that point <i>is</i> disruptive, juvenile, and passive aggressive, but if you're not prepared to confront the issue directly, the best answer available is still say yes or roll the dice.<br/><br/>The best thing to do is be direct, lay all expectations out on the table, and ultimately, decide what kind of people you want to play with.  Short of doing that though, you need to find the opportunities for fun in the situation as it stands.  Being obstructionist with "A" is not going to get you those opportunities for fun.  Heck, you may even be able to draw her into the group more by introducing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fun</span> complications that arise as a result of her lone wolf behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147112/#Comment_147112" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T11:55:08+00:00" title="June  1, 2008 11:55AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>...and the reasons you give for the NPC to refuse to read for her are meta-game reasons - you're punishing her for being lame. That's passive-aggressive and unproductive.</i><br/><br/>I'm confused about the punishing idea -- that makes it seem more vindictive than I'd intended. Several people have said I'm trying to inflict some punishment, but I just see it as a case of "if you do X, you'll get Y, and if you don't do X, you won't get Y."  In terms of meta-gaming, she surely seems to be doing at least as much by waiting to see what everyone else got (there were no in-character benefits given out, only meta-game benefits) and then deciding she needed to get what she "deserved" to have.<br/><br/><i>Hindsight is always 20/20, but nothing about her behavior up to that point precludes interesting play arising from her late entry to the room.</i><br/><br/>That's possibly true.  It's just really hard for me as a DM when the rest of the group seems to have the idea of "one of the necessary conceits for this game to work is that we need to all come together, so we'll work to smooth over those rough edges" while another one basically is saying "the only way you'll get me to join this group is kicking and screaming, since I'll work against cooperative, and even then, I still want the same 'benefits' everyone else gets."<br/><br/>I think, yeah, there's a certain amount of metagaming in expecting players to work together to help bring the game together.   I found it very frustrating that "A" wouldn't apparently meet me half-way, and didn't even bother to try to roleplay any sort of introduction or attempt at an apology for being late, or whatever -- simply barged in to gain a buff. That's not how I see RPGs working, and the way I did it does appear to be an example of how they're meant to work.<br/><br/><i>Being obstructionist with "A" is not going to get you those opportunities for fun.</i><br/><br/>Can you unpack "obstructionist" some more?  I would see obstructionism as preventing her from doing what she chooses to do -- "oh, the NPC sees you lurking outside and goes out to invite you in" -- rather than allowing her to do what she wants and allowing the consequences to happen.<br/><br/><i>...the best answer available is still say yes or roll the dice.</i><br/><br/>I suppose I could have had her make a diplomacy check to influence the NPC, instead of saying "no." I wasn't prepared to say yes at that point, so maybe I was <i>was</i> being vindictive? Or possibly just exercising valid judgment.

I think it's good for everyone to talk about what they want from their characters; she seemed to become happier later when she could just engage in combat and kill things -- "be useful" is how she put it.<br/><br/>To me, it felt like her working at cross-purposes, because I still don't know what she was working toward, but I was working toward getting everyone together in one place to do one thing, and my unspoken assumption was that everyone, especially an experienced player, would understand this to be the case.<br/><br/>I don't agree with people saying "A" is immature or a bad player, or even that her ranger deserves to die in lava.  I sure wasn't trying to kill her later on, but she kept running off to places with critters in them, trying herself to get killed, and I didn't feel right stepping in with the almighty hand of the DM to save her from self-destructiveness.

This doesn't mean that the players always get what they want, or that they always succeed, but it does mean that all their choices result in interesting play.  That style of gamemastering is the opposite of obstructionism.<br/><br/>What you describe with 'A', I would consider to be obstructionist; She comes in to get her reading, but the fortuneteller refuses; she runs off to break in to the building, but none of the doors will open, and no one reacts to her presence; she tries to swim around to the other side of the building, but a shark blocks her path.  Each of these scenarios basically boils down to "nothing happens; you can't have what you want."  That's boring and unrewarding for everyone.  <br/><br/>What if the fortuneteller agreed to tell A's fortune, but because doing so delays the fortuneteller's departure, soldiers who have been hunting her catch up with her, and she (the fortuneteller) is captured, requiring a daring rescue?  Alternately, what if they just had a cool argument, and the NPC grudgingly agreed to the reading, but the negative emotions engendered by the argument colored the reading in a spooky way?  What if guards saw A trying to break into the building, and it resulted in an awesome rooftop chase through the city?  None of these scenarios result in A's character getting what she wants, and all of them involve negative consequences, but they're consequences that are <i>interesting in play</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147132/#Comment_147132" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T15:07:22+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  3:07PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite><i>I posted this on my LJ and on Knife Fight, but here I'm asking you guys specifically for play advice about how to handle this without going nuts, without bending the game just because one player is disruptive, and without clobbering her with "page 11" and tossing her from the game!</i></blockquote>\nI agree wholeheartedly with noclue, Wilhelm, and buzz.<br/><br/>There's some more tricks you can do (introduced in this thread, above, like the one buzz suggested: It IS, in fact, a Team Game), and see if things will work right again one day.

You can nudge her off that track with some clever tricks, but in the end she's go back into her normal orbit of disruptive behavior. <br/><br/>If that continues, the only options then are to:<br/><br/>*Put up with it. A dysfunctional, painful family that you visit weekly and have a mediocre time with.<br/>*Change it up. Officially cancel this group. Then, after a month, "find more time" to create a new group, inviting everyone back but "A" (or if "A" has a Significant Other in the group, then without A+SO). Find other players to fill the gap, or just say that you're experimenting with smaller groups, Whatever lie it takes to make things work without (when A eventually hears about it) feeling too bad. Or, alternately, if you're the spokesperson for the group, and the others see this behavior as well, then vote her off the island.<br/>*Leave them behind. Find an entirely new group. I've only done this once (with a 3e campaign back in 2001-2002 or so). I told them that I was just getting too busy with a recent career change and responsibilities, and that I felt like my head wasn't in the game. I was gonna take a breather and maybe, one day, come back. That made them feel nice about the situation. In reality, the DM was kind of a dilweed, two of the players were totally boring, and another was a braying jackass.

One person bringing down everyone's fun, and knee-jerk reactions to punish, isolate, or remove that person, is important to consider when you are doing group youth or adult counseling, or visiting your family (if dysfunctional).

I wish I thought of that before.  I only played in one 2e game in college where one player was playing the "outside loner", but it was just the setup of his character; he knew full well, and told us, that eventually he'd do more with us "when his character trusted us" (he was big into acting, and wanted to play this out naturally). Over the period of four sessions, his character gradually began to trust more and finally went hand in hand with the party.  So the thing is, we all knew this, and knew that the player was setting a "loner timeline" in place that would end in 3-5 sessions through play. If he didn't do it by then, we'd be like, "What the fuck, c'mon man". But instead he stuck with it, and it worked well with the plot of the adventures.  It doesn't sound like "A" is thinking that far ahead, but instead playing a Solo game, that just happens to be around other people.<br/><br/>Good rules won't fix busted people.<br/>(cont)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147133/#Comment_147133" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T15:07:32+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  3:07PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Locally, there's this woman who sells boardgames as a full-time job (basically as a kind of reseller from home, her husband made most of the house money). WORST FUCKING SORE LOSER in the universe. I played "Princes of Florence" for the first time with her, her husband and their two friends (I loved the look of the game and wanted to try it out). Every setback, she swore like a sailor, her voice getting darker and darker, her mood clouding the table like a fucking shadow. When her HUSBAND did something that was a gain for him or a setback for her, she'd totally rip into ("What the FUCK??? You're always doing this shit to me! What the fuck? Can't you fucking do something else?" etc). I thought it was a joke, till I looked at the other couple, who basically wore these faces like, "Sorry, she's like this. Can't be helped."  I was mortified. This was the worst sore loser I had ever played any game with (including children), and she wasn't even losing. She ruins the game experience for everyone at the table with her accusations, dark mood and swearing AT people. Yet "she loves boargames". When the game was done (I came in second, she came in third, her husband came in first, to which he got another round of verbal lashing), it was like she returned to this "Strawberry Shortcake" like personality. "Wow, that was pretty fun!" (in an upbeat voice as we're putting it away). I looked back at the other couple, and sure enough they've got this expression like, "Hey, we're just here for the games, we're able to blank it out". I was invited to attend their regular board game events. Of course, I never did.<br/><br/>Boardgames have the tightest rules on the planet, and yet they can be totally ruined by one problem person who may or may not recongize his or her behavior. It's not your job to be their counselor and get to the root of their issue so that they can play a healthy game with others; it's your job to provide fun, look out for your own fun, and get the fuck out of Dodge City when that job becomes imbalanced.<br/><br/>That's my thought, anyway.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147139/#Comment_147139" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T15:46:56+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  3:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2008 3:48PM by noclue.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>Okay, I am seeing some of the "punishment" angle that other people are seeing -- by the time we'd gotten to the point where she came in the room to get a reading, I'd gotten annoyed enough with her persistent lurking-instead-of-joining-the-group that I wasn't looking for ways to resolve the situation with humor, grace, and cooperation.</blockquote>Bingo! Although it seems your reading a pejorative in the term punishment that I didn't intend.  <br/><br/>To clarify my post and because I'm a windbag who likes to "see" himself talk:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>Actually, between our previous argument and this one, we'd made up (I apologized humbly and worked to patch things up, and we'd spent time together since), and she was really enthused about playing.<br/></blockquote>That sounds like baggage to me. Judging by how things played out at the table, some of it less than resolved.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>I don't know; I see it as consequences rather than punishment.</blockquote>I can work with "consequences." I use the term myself, with my kids. I sometimes send them to their rooms as a "consequence" for their behavior when I want to highlight the fact that they had all the power in the situation, they could have foreseen the outcome, they chose the course of events. Usually, I prefer "punishment" because it highlights the fact that their misbehavior was an attempt to change the power distribution in our relationship and I am forcibly asserting that the power stays with me. Of course, I don't say all this stuff to them. I just say "you're being punished" or "your behavior has consequences." <br/><br/>In this case I like punished better because consequences is non-specific language that hides the fact that you and A are peers, both acting and reacting to each other. Nothing is just happening. But, that is largely semantic wankery on my part. Consequences works.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>I'm saying I'd like to hear what makes you think I did something capricious to "bone" her. I am really curious</blockquote>Words like capricious and vindictive are heavily loaded and easy to misconstrue in an internet post. I would rather use words like "active" and "conscious" because they don't carry the same negative connotations. If "boned" is also to loaded, maybe we could use "schooled?" "A" behaved poorly and she got "schooled."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>I did let her go off and do what she wanted, only for her to find that -- shocker! -- if a single character takes on a D&amp;D adventure designed for 4 characters, she'll get in over her head.</blockquote>Yes, schooled seems to fit <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147141/#Comment_147141" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T16:01:11+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  4:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>Boot</blockquote>Fear the Boot is a podcast about gaming. Episode 2 discusses ways to get the players all on the same page using a Group Template that you all create together, so you don't have the tree-hugging druid or ranger who won't go into town with the rest of the party, or the kinder thief who steals from the other PCs and turns everything into a PVP gankfest, or freakshow characters of all manner of weird description that don't fit with the game. JDCorley touched on these issues in his post about discussing how the players are going to react to each other before the game begins. Its a good time to bring up concerns like "I have some concerns about how this lone ranger character is going to find a reason to travel with the rest of the party? What's her motivation for being here? Why do they accept her?" Some games build this stuff into Chargen explicitly, but you can import it into games that don't.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>But that's what crappy DMs do.

Everyone shares responsibility for avoiding annoying behavior and knee-jerk reactions. <br/><br/>My point in all this is not whether you are wrong or right. I'm not sure being right is really relevant to the issue of whether you and A can game together and have fun. Being clear in your expectations of one another, I think, could help you decide if your play styles can be compatible, or if you should just hang out and do other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147142/#Comment_147142" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T16:14:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  4:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

The principle I measure it from is that system itself can open doors for players, without the players having to earn it in any way at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147254/#Comment_147254" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T07:56:16+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  7:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  Kynn, you did Punish "A." I want to state that clearly. You started to say you see it. But, then you backed off by justifying your behavior. The reality is, no one can force the words out of your mouth when you GM. There was no rule making you say "No" and no law of nature that forced your hand.<br/>\n  Clearly, this is an out of game issue. Please, do not try and solve out of game issues in game. What I mean is, the character is in game. In game the character is not a problem. They are not breaking the law or acting in a way that is disruptive to the game world, right? In cases like this, it is appropriate to send in game consequences after them. If they break the law, send the guards. If they unmake the world, send a paladin or white mage. But, this issue has nothing to do with the character, character actions or setting.<br/>\n  The problem does have to do with the person at the table. So address that problem with that person. But, before you do anything accusatory, etc. Find out how the other players feel. Maybe they think the lone wolf thing is fun or cute. Maybe they just don't care. If you are the only one who has a problem with this, that changes the whole dynamic, right? And if the other players agree that this is an issue (their behavior isolated from your reactions to it). Then that presents an opportunity to say, I was wrong, but I am not the only one affected. Don't immediately mention this issue about the other players. You don't want to leave the impression that you are talking about them behind their back or that you are campaigning against them. But, if the defense arises, you're the only one that has a problem, you have an answer.<br/>\n  Also, try and escalate slowly.<br/>\n  First, talk to them in private about this issue. Make sure to clearly communicate what the issue is as you see it. Don't just say, your Ranger was a loner 'til it stopped benefiting them or you went off to the BBEG's hideout alone. But state what you see the overall arch of the problem is like "I don't know what you want from the game" or "your character concepts/actions is messing with the group dynamics," or whatever the problem actually is. And be careful to use language that is not accusatory or leaves them no way to explain/redeem themselves. Like if you say, "you were a jerk," the only possible responses are "so what" or "ok, I guess I won't be a jerk anymore." There's no room for discussion or debate.<br/>\n  If that doesn't work, then schedule time before the game session starts and discuss the issue as a group to see how we can solve it together. Make sure it doesn't turn into a "bitch session" and that "A" doesn't feel piled up on. But, let them know, in no uncertain terms, that it is affecting the entire group.<br/>\n  After that, you might have to ask another group member to adjudicate between you two. Maybe the SO might be able to find a balance between the group and their SO, you know?<br/>\n  Anyways, sorry that this player was so disruptive and I hope this advice helps!<br/>\nDave M<br/>\n<br/>\nPS<br/>\n  Sorry about the looong post...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147257/#Comment_147257" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T08:12:21+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  8:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I don't think I can help in your specific situation Kynn, but I am really interested in what fuels "Lone Wolf" players in general.  It's obviously common enough that we have a name for it, and I know I've seen players do this before.  So what gives?  People who have played these characters, what did you get out of it?<br/><br/>Maybe it's the thrill of knowing something the other characters don't? It's hard to have good competition between characters in D&amp;D, because it kills characters and hurts feelings, so maybe the Lone Wolf is a way to "beat" the other players without getting into combat.</blockquote>\nOne thing I've noticed about her type of play, and in fact of many people in this group, is that they like to enforce a lot of in-game and out-of-character secrecy between players.<br/><br/>There was one campaign I was in with "A" where she played a ninja -- and I didn't know her race, as a fellow player in the game.  She just kept it a secret, for no apparent reason.  (Human with lycanthropic bloodline.)  I just don't mean she didn't have her character tell me; she didn't even let me see her character sheet.<br/><br/>I think players should be more open and verbal about their characters, even identifying their "secrets" OOCly, because then the other players can actually help shape things around the way they wish to be seen.<br/><br/>But that's not the style of play in this group, which is basically "A" and her friends from high school.

But likewise, she could have said "Can I make a Diplomacy check to change her mind?" in D&amp;D, and she didn't do that either.<br/><br/>I also could have, as has been suggested before, turned it into an opportunity to do something interesting -- again, not system.

I really would like to enforce the "no party splitting" part.  The rogue, scout, and/or ranger in these groups -- who is almost always "A"! -- always has to "go off ahead to scout." It's logical, it's reasonable, it's in-character, but it's also difficult because of just attention and logistical reasons.<br/><br/>Also, an unrelated gripe about this group of players -- I can't <i>stand</i> the fact that it's accepted behavior for the smokers (there's two of them, not "A") to get up whenever they feel like and step outside for a smoke, including in the middle of combat. "Hey, it's 'B's turn to attack, someone go tell him to come back inside."

She was feeling left out and cut out of the plot, and just wanted to be included. Granted, it's hard to square that with her lurking around outside and not even getting an introduction to the other characters, but -- I wanted her to be included, she wanted to be included, and instead I did something that made her feel excluded.

If the player likes the loner character type ask her (and everyone else) what they like about it.<br/><br/>Secondly, make two things explicit to the players because this stuff isn't obvious to many people that play certain games:<br/>1)  Everyone brings their own fun to the table.  If she's having fun lurking around then so be it.  She has a responsibility to support the other players and they have a responsibility to support her.  Introduce the idea of little color scenes where they get to make other characters look cool.  Start off with "where is you character and how does your interaction with them make them look cool?"<br/><br/>2)  Everyone needs to understand that conflict is good and that they should look forward to having bad things happen to them as long as it moves story along (assuming story is important to them).  Thus it's okay for the GM to levy crazy consequences on them as long as the consequences are part of a roll (many players hate GM fiat) and are stated ahead of time.<br/><br/>Consequences should always move the story forward and enhance fun.  Make your NPCs cower and whimper under the might of the PCs power.  "Okay!  Okay, I will read your cards!" and have it be something dark and forboding, maybe even to reflect the mood of the fortune-teller. <br/><br/>How I run these games (because they don't really tell us how to):\n<ul><li>Set a scene up based on locale, NPCs present, etc.  </li>\n<li>Ask each player what they want from the scene - "what's at stake?"  Do they have different goals?  Do they want to support one another?  Do they want to be in direct conflict and how?</li>\n<li>Ask how they plan on getting what they want from the scene.  What skills or feats or powers do they want to use?</li>\n<li>Let them know what may happen if they fail their roll.  Give them something to FIGHT for - to spend Action Points on, to help one another to avoid, etc.</li>\n<li>Wrap up the scene based on their stakes and the result of their roll.  Ask them if there is anything they want to add.</li>\n<li>Move onto the next scene.  Often this may be some followup item or reacting to fallout to the stakes.  Never have scenes setup to negate previous stakes, only build upon them.</li></ul>\nI often even ask players "what is it you want out of this combat?"  If it's to survive or kill everyone else I try and set things up  to push more buttons such as "stop someone from using a powerful magic item or continuing a ritual or from killing an NPC."<br/><br/>I have a lot of experience (as we all do) with loner characters.  Having a little more scene-based game allows them to shine a little more and the other players to reflect on who the character is and what he's all about despite the characters' ignorance.  <br/><br/>I hope that is at all helpful,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147441/#Comment_147441" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T20:32:56+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  8:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>But nah, keep blaming yourself.

IME, especially when it comes to "traditional" gaming and all the baggage it often entails (i.e., been playing D&amp;D since high school, where all sorts of weird behaviors were learned), very frequently, a player can be imagining the coolest thing in the world when she does something like A. did, and nobody else will get it.  Happened with one friend of mine, a very cool guy, who kept trying to bring things into our D&amp;D game that he thought were the coolest, and all of us just kind of thought it was creepy.  Sat down with him later on, asked him to explain the cool, and then I got it.<br/><br/>So, I'm suspecting a lack of communication, which is usually solved by communicating more.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>-Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148536/#Comment_148536" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T01:03:02+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  1:03AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2008 1:09AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm mostly joking when I say this, but there are times when communicating more doesn't help. <br/><br/>I have a friend who kept coming back to those same damn stealthy ninja chick characters we were all sick to death of by the time we were 19. After two, count em, two campaigns where his total involvement was remaining stealthy or incognito for the majority of the sessions, jumping in with a drastic action that shook up the game world about 30 minutes before the end of the last session, and then going "That game was awesome!", I was like, okay, this guy is married and in his 30's, obviously I can have a mature conversation and get him to explain the cool, figure out what he is going for, we can work that in to future games while having him, yknow, actually play, and everybody will be happy.<br/><br/>Turns out, nope, that's as deep as the well goes. He just really likes stealthy ninja chicks so much that hiding and then lovingly doodling on his character sheet for a couple of hours a week was all he wanted. <br/><br/>We now stick to video games when he's hanging out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
