Here is a shipping breakdown.<br/><br/>BWG<br/>Sent from: Staten Island NY<br/>Date Sent: 08/08 (8 days)<br/>Type of shipping: Priority (Flat Rate Envelope, 4lbs. Max.)<br/>Shipping weight: 2lbs<br/>Cost: $13.25<br/>Condition upon delivery: Perfect (2x bubble wrap, handwrapped)<br/><br/>Bulldogs!<br/>Sent from: Washington NJ<br/>Date Sent: 08/06 (10 Days)<br/>Type of Shipping: Priority Mail<br/>Shipping Weight: 2lbs<br/>Cost: $30.31<br/>Condition upon delivery: Lightly damaged (Bottom edge pinched/crushed/torn in one spot where the bubble wrap was thin. Unlucky.)<br/><br/>What have we learned?<br/>The biggest difference in the two books are their dimensions, BWG being smaller). Bulldogs! was a Kickstarter "purchase", so the shipping wasn't out of my pocket. If ti was, There would be a Bulldogs!-sized gap on my bookshelf.<br/>Recommendation:<br/>Smaller form factors: I don't believe Bulldogs! would've suffered from reduced, BWG-sized dimensions. Of course, I'm being pretty me-centric about this, as someone living in the USA wouldn't be all that fussed. Still, if you are concerned with your overseas presence, producing a product that fits comfortably in a flat rate envelope can't hurt.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
