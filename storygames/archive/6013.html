We've not yet picked a system, and I'd like some suggestions. We can test any suggestions this weekend.<br/><br/>The game will be for kids, ages 10-12. Some of them may be new to gaming. The GM is also pretty new, having played a couple of storygames. She's extremely comfortable with the setting. Which is a fantastic 1550s England, with the characters as companions of the young Elizabeth, before she was made queen. Characters may be apprentice alchemists and teenage scientists, new to court intrigue. It could be a swashbuckley Harry Potter in tone.<br/><br/>Systemwise, she'd like something extremely collaborative - the idea of wanting a central GM with lots of power genuinely baffles her. So we're talking stakes setting, or goal negotiation, and conflict resolution of some sort. Lots of out of character chat informing play, certainly. Nothing tactical. A system that drives play somewhat - so could have specific scene mechanics, say. NPCs are either simple or not mechanically rated. And we're looking at about 3 hours play, with plenty of breaks. We could do some character generation, but that should be minimal.<br/><br/>Any suggestions? Oh, the system should either be free or readily available PDF. Or be a hack of something on my shelf, which is pretty big.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134552/#Comment_134552" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T06:01:00+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  6:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, there's only one choice for this. The Princes' Kingdom. Not only because it perfectly fits the premise you have. But because buying it (if you do, or if any of them or their parents do), gives money to a children's charity: http://crngames.com/the_princes_kingdom/<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't have it, and can't get it in time, it's simply a well-written hack of DitV. Instead of "dogs," the titular "princes" are empowered by their link to the throne to effect change in the world. But in this case, they are children, and have to deal with the fact that they are dealing with adults. The escalation is somewhat different than DitV (no guns, obviously). So get the game to get the cool details if you can. But otherwise just try it with DitV, and see how it comes out. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134554/#Comment_134554" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T06:17:16+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  6:17AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!
