That's cool and all, and I think it's a marvel of engineering that they've managed to sneak conflict resolution into a historically mostly task-resolution game, in a way that makes it really intuitive to grasp the difference.  <br/><br/>However, I don't really like it.  Aside from the wonky math, I just can't see myself using this at the table, outside of very structured situations in dungeons and the like.  It's not very easy to throw together on the fly, and doing so kind of defeats the purpose of the whole thing.  It also strikes me as pretty time-consuming, which I have zero tolerance for.  I usually play very short sessions (around 2 hours), and spending even fifteen minutes chatting up an NPC in a game about beating dungeons is intolerable for me.<br/><br/>So this is what I propose to do:<br/><br/>The Mission:<br/>During character creation, the players all think up a "Quest" (as per the 4E rules) that will be the initial impetus for the group forming.  For example, they might ll be victims of a marauding orc band, and their first quest is to stop the orc.  More complex quests work better though, like "clean up the streets of Newport" or "Return Winterhaven to prosperity".  Everyone should make PCs with a stake in the first Quest.  The quest will be completed in 10 to 15 encounters, so it shouldn't be too epic.   Something fairly mundane.  The GM and the players can work together to create setting elements that support the mission.<br/><br/>Story:<br/>Every character also has a "Story" (In the "what's his story?" sense).  It's something unresolved from their background - a personal mission, a mortal enemy, a dark past, or something like that.  "Kill the Bleaksea Wyrm" or "Find my father's sword" are the kinds of thing I mean.  These will take roughly 10 levels ( a whole tier) to resolve, so they should be appropriately large in scope.  As with missions, the players should work with the GM to make setting elements to suport their story.  <br/><br/>Play:<br/>During play, the characters explore the world, and try to achieve their mission.  When the players want to achieve something in the world that works toward their mission - say "find out who's organizing the local crime syndicate" or "get materials for Gaspard the Blacksmith" they must "face the dungeon".  The GM tells them a little about the prepped dungeon, and then everyone brainstoms a way to relate that dungeon to the current situation.  For example: "Ok, there's this informant, but she's been kidnapped by kobolds" or "Maybe there's a nearby mine, but it's overrun by the kobolds".  In this way, the GM only needs to prep a single dungeon for each session, with a little flexibility to make it fit the situation.<br/><br/>Dungeons:<br/>The GM preps a single dungeon for each session.  Dungeons should be around five encounters, or whatever can be comfortably completed in one session.  There can be skill challenges within the dungeons, but mostly they're combat encounters.  Importantly though, every few dungeons should contain a link to one of the character's "stories".  Perhaps there's a scroll which contains lore about the Bleaksea Wyrm, or a clue to the location of the sword, or whatever.  Ideally, these links should be presented as "Bangs" - the goal of the PC conflicts a little with the goals of the part, forcing a change of priorities.  Not too much, or the dynamic of the game breaks down, but just a little - one of the villains has some information the PC needs, the father's sword is weilded by an NPC ally, and so on.  <br/><br/>Completing Quests:<br/>The GM decides when players have completed a mission, and how their successes and failures have affected the outcome of the mission.  This should be after 10 to 15 encounters - roughly two missions every three levels.  When the characters complete a Mission, they all together choose a new one - this new mission can be inspired by things they've encountered in the previous mission, or it can be created entirely anew.  It may be required to add more to the setting to support this.<br/><br/>Completing Stories:<br/>A character completes their story when the initial situation is resolved, successfully or otherwise.  The GM should pace this to occurr just before completing a tier, around eigth or ninth level, then again at eighteenth or ninteenth.  Succeed or fail, characters get their quest XP points.  It's perfectly valid for the player to decide that their character lets the NPC keep their father's sword, or gives up on ever finding the Bleaksea Wyrm.  When a character reaches a new tier, they can choose a new "story" - a new personal goal for their character.  This should be tied to their paragon path at paragon tier, and to their epic destiny at epic level.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152849/#Comment_152849" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T03:12:16+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  3:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            contd.<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure of all of this.  I think I'd need to work out exactly how it felt in play, especially the "face the dungeon" part, and how well the game blends between "exploring" "dungeon" and "completing quests".  I'm also worried about the Missions and Stories being a bit "Story Before", in the sense that you say what you're going to do, then you go and do it.  My hope is that there's enough scope for things to work out differently in play, so that it's always surprising.  <br/><br/>The intention is to create a way of playing D&amp;D that supports vanilla Narr, and sandboxy play, which is reaching pretty high.  Hopefully it cuts down on wasted prep, as well.  I'd really like to hear opinions though, especially with regards to how well this would work out in the minute-to-minute play outside the dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153296/#Comment_153296" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T22:51:09+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 10:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon: I love it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153304/#Comment_153304" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T23:49:26+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 11:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did "say yes or face the dungeon" with Basic D&amp;D, and it worked great.

It's easy to tell when you've succeeded on a dungeon, but how do you fail one?<br/><br/>Like, maybe we fail if we leave the dungeon without succeeding?  Then we only get one shot at it -- if we leave the dungeon to get healed, we give up on whatever it is we were trying to do.  The kidnapped informant is killed, etc.  This makes management of limited resources (healing surges etc.) really important.  And if you're severely weakened and have yet to face the dungeon boss, then you've got a very difficult choice to make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153314/#Comment_153314" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T00:46:18+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 12:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whew!

I'd tend to leave it up to GM discretion to some extent - like, if they rest once it's ok, but resting again means there'll be some consequences of that - not complete failure but something goes wrong a little - it's only if they stall for a really long time that they fail.  My feeling is that PC failure isn't something that should be a big part of a standard D&amp;D game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153359/#Comment_153359" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T10:59:24+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 10:59AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon:  Here's something I've been thinking about since last night.<br/><br/>Back in my bad old days of illusionist GMing, I would very often create something like a dungeon (or a set-piece battle or a "skill challenge" or whatever) and then try to drop it into the players' path.

Basically, the question is whether we need concrete rules for succeeding and failing a dungeon, and if we need concrete rules for completing or failing a mission or story.  I originally thought yes, but the more I tried to write them, the more they made the game feel formulaic and forced.  I'd want to try some actual play to know for sure, but my feeling is that the group will reach a consensus on what constitutes success and failure.  The idea is to priviledge the actual events in the fiction for determining success, rather than some pre-determined number of encounters beaten, or whatever.  You know if you've returned the town to prosperity based on what's happened in the fiction, not on how many dungeons you've beaten.  I think it's the players who decide if they've completed a mission to their satisfaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153559/#Comment_153559" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T11:04:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 11:04AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True!<br/><br/>But the "system" could be as simple as a vote taken by the group, or even something unobtrusive, like the player, deciding their Quest is complete, returning the little Quest card they made to the box at the corner of the table.<br/><br/>I'm just saying that for me, personally, it would be more interesting if I, as GM, didn't have to make all those decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153621/#Comment_153621" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T18:53:56+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  6:53PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul,<br/><br/>For my own clarification, aren't you really just asking for a clearer set of mechanics around the Bangs mentioned in the earlier part or am I missing the point?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153641/#Comment_153641" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T23:04:19+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 11:04PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I'm talking about the "Completing Quests" and "Completing Stories" bits.

Tell us how to achieve that! What games have you played that did that well?<br/>I have to say, currently I don't play for it. I've just come to learn it as a sort of side effect of gamist design study - sort of learnt about walking and running while learning about doggie paddling and swimming, so to speak. That said, I don't think I've played anything that's done it except in a fragmentary sense. I don't own any indie RPG's though, just can't find them here.<br/><br/>On achieving it - well, do you mean trying to jam it into an existing game or designing a new game that from the outset has this in mind? I'll talk about the latter. <br/><br/>Basically your designing <i>against </i>the age old chatchism of roleplay, where you don't let the dice get in the way of the story. Here, your trying to set it up so the dice will f*** you over. The difficulty of designing this way is that as a designer you not only probably have a story in mind, you see getting to that story as your <b>reward </b>for the <b>task </b>of making the game. It wont be a specific story, but you'll have something in mind. Reward mechanism are very important, even during the actual design of a game. In order to design a new way, you have to have some grasp of how you reward yourself for designing - otherwise you'll fall into the old reward patterns and thus, make the same game over and over again.<br/><br/>Lost anyone yet? Too high falutin'? Did I even spell falutin' right? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The next stage is to identify self satisfying <i>story </i>chunks - not whole story, but bits which are satisfying. For example, what self satisfying for me is a shadowy figure on the lip of a derelict building, rain pouring down, twin nimbuses of muzzle flash from each hand as he empties automatic weapons onto something deserving below. Or the moment, stooped over a dead loved one, the deadly calm moment where the figure rises - and in that movement so much hell is decided. Both of these give me shivers up my spine - that shows their good! <br/><br/>These are story chunks - they aren't story in themselves, just important, pivotal moments. This might be hard for some people, as they will 'story before' and imagine the chunks as important just in themselves. This means they wont be interested in how the chunks intermingle with other chunks and other contributions. I'll leave that for now, cause that's not my problem. But anyway, these chunks will serve as the basis of your reward system for writing the game, in that you know the spine tingling events will occur for you once the games done.<br/><br/>Once you have this certain reward, you can start working on the uncertain reward that is the shopping trolley of doom. In other words, you need to make sure a certain payoff is there, before you get into speculative/uncertain design. Because the whole point of story uncertainty is that you don't know what sort of story your going to get, and it's human nature to pursue known rewards before gambling on uncertainty. Therefore you need to cater to your human nature and ensure you have certain rewards before you have a chance at writing 'uncertain story' mechanics.<br/><br/>On a side note, this is why, I think, trying to freeform it at the table is usually damn hard. Participants need their hard rewards, but one mans seeking a certain reward is another mans railroading. And when someone loses their certain reward, their frustrated and disintereted in the gamble of uncertain story.<br/><br/>Eh, I've written alot and there's more, but I'll leave it there, to see if anyones still interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153756/#Comment_153756" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T21:04:49+00:00" title="June 29, 2008  9:04PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, perhaps it's best if you take this to another thread?

(provisional draft - may be improved after I read D&amp;D4e; manuals more thoroughly - currently, you'll see a mismatch of 3rd ed. and 4th ed. elements in it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>--- SAY YES, IN THIS AGE, OR FACE THE WICKED DUNGEON ---</b><br/>\n<br/>\nA fantasy game about adventurous scoundrels, ambitious mercenary captains and wannabe archmages competing (or at times allying) for fame and fortune, immortal glory or the favour of kings, in a Lankhmar-esque city (possibly portrayed with hints of Renaissance Italy, or maybe not).<br/>\n<br/>\nCould be a master-full/master-less game, or a game with a single traditional GM figure.<br/>\nEmploys the full extent of some other games' rules (likely D&amp;D; 4ed.) as its resolution system.<br/>\n<br/>\nMain characters (one for each player, except the one GM if any) are adventuring party leaders with some political agenda <i>or </i>a long-term quest to accomplish. Besides creating a full D&amp;D; character sheet for each of them, sit down as a group and name "Best interests" for the main characters, taking care that a few of those directly oppose, some others overlap, some conflict, some are orthogonal.<br/>\nOptionally, Oracles may be drawn in the beginning as in IAWA, and characters created according to what the Oracles foretell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Additional preparation:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nEach player compiles full character sheets for adventuring companions to their main character. Such secondary characters can be sketchier than their commanders, and need no Best interests defined; but they need complete game statistics and they should form an effective adventuring party (with their leader).<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody also needs to prepare (or adapt) some short, level appropriate, multi-encounter dungeons, rated for their Difficulty Level (see notes below). In a GM-full game, each player should have a few prepared.<br/>\nIn a single-GM game, the GM will prepare a larger number, but even non-GM players should have one or more dungeons ready to run, though they probably won't need many.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The flow of the game:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIf there's a single GM, she frames scenes "around" main characters in turns (sort of in MLwM). He should frame scenes with an eye toward building conflicts.<br/>\nIn a GM-full game, players take turn framing scenes. It is their prerogative to include their own main character in the scene, or not. They'll likely use scene-framing privileges to advantage their own character and move the story toward completion of character goals.<br/>\nThe subset of "gamey" rules (that is, the whole of D&amp;D;) won't be used, except in the dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154767/#Comment_154767" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T19:08:08+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  7:08PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Conflict resolution:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm using the term "Challenger" to denote the player whose character was attempting some action which another player won't just say yes to, thus leading to Conflict. The Challenger is <b>always</b> a Main character - or, rather, you must be playing a Main character in the scene in order to be the Challenger.<br/>\n"Opponent" is the player somehow opposing the Challenger's action, usually via her own Main character in the scene, or by the means of some NPC in case of the GM or the framer of the scene. Note that entering a Conflict with a NPC means being in a Conflict with the one GM <i>or</i> with the scene-framing player in GM-full play.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless the Challenger retreats from the Conflict, thus accepting defeat, he's got to Face The Dungeon. The Opponent has to provide a level-appropriate dungeon.<br/>\nSome negotiation and stake-setting may happen, notably the Challenger asking for more out of success in the Conflict, in exchange for facing a higher Difficulty Level dungeon (difficulty can also be increased by making it impossible to rest, resupply, etc., thus adjusting the level of a prepared dungeon in no time). The Opponent may also bargain for extra penalties and prices in case the Challenger meets defeat, by offering the Challenger treats such as a lower Difficulty Level dungeon, one or more "free" rests while facing the dungeon, free special equipment appropriate to the dungeon, etc. In practice, this makes it possible to "adapt" a not-quite-level-appropriate prepared dungeon to the Conflict, saving preparation or allowing "recycling" of unused leftovers from lower experience levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Opponent also states the general "theme" of the dungeon - such as "Kobold lair", "Haunted graveyard", or "Attacked by pirates during a riverboat trip". Once the terms of the Conflict are agreed on, <b>it is the Challenger who has to come up with an explanation</b> which makes sense of the dungeon in context, relating it to the conflict at hand; NPCs asking to retrieve something from the dungeon are a simple example (put in other words, "Conflict" ends up replacing "adventure hook"). Minor (mechanically non-influent) adjustments may be asked from the Opponent, such as placing a prisoner or mcguffin somewhere for the party to retrieve.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>In the dungeon:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nTime to hit the D&amp;D; rules... with the Opponent taking up the mantle of DM, and the Challenger playing his own Main character as PC.<br/>\nThe Challenger also hands out character sheets for his Adventuring companions to any players (except the Opponent) he can trust to help him in his quest. Any player he cannot trust with such a task for any reason (such as strong in-character opposition to the Challenger triumphing in the Contest) can instead become an assistant to the DM, helping with monster tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, the adventuring party will be able to equip and provision themselves under standard D&amp;D; rules before facing the dungeon. They may also reprovision and buy new equipment when resting (except if prohibited to).<br/>\n<br/>\nSPECIAL RULE: NO RESTING IN THE DUNGEON. When the party needs to rest, they have to retreat to whatever "room" (encounter area) they started in, usually to "make a trip back to town". As this happens, the DM (Opponent) is given a few minutes of real time to either replenish an encounter area the party has cleared already (adding a new level-appropriate encounter to it) or strengthen an existing, still unchallenged encounter, bumping its encounter level up by 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Failure is an option:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Challenger's party may fail against the dungeon, either by TPK, or just by failing to achieve some constructed mission objective. The possibility of failure is real, and much more likely than in your standard D&amp;D; game (a loaded method of Difficulty Level calculation, based on higher Encounter Level, ensures this). This is actually the only way a Challenger can ever be on the losing side of a Conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any event, MAIN CHARACTERS NEVER DIE. They may appear to be killed, but will actually be back to the City with their exp.level reduced by 1, and having failed their short-term quest (which can't be attempted again). This can and should be explained by the character's player in whatever way they see fit - be it by telling a tale of captivity and a narrow escape, or by just saying: "of course I had a stipulation with a friendly temple for my body to be magically summoned there in the event of my death, and resurrected".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe level loss is the minimum price for failure, and is in addition to any extra penalty agreed upon when framing the Conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nSome notes about dungeon configuration and Difficulty Level will follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154900/#Comment_154900" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-04T18:42:49+00:00" title="July  4, 2008  6:42PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2008 6:44PM by Rafu.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>NOTES</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>Difficulty Level for the dungeon:</b></i><br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]I'm envisioning a simple table, crossing "average Encounter Level" with "number of encounters" to provide a Difficulty Level.<br/>\n<br/>\n[*]Compared to standard D&amp;D;, dungeons should be shorter and more challenging (because "failure is an option"!). Thus, for a number of encounters equaling the D&amp;D; "safety range" between rests (which used to be 4 encounters in 3.x, not sure about 4e), a somewhat higher-than-average-party-level EL should yield a "level appropriate" Difficulty Level.<br/>\n<br/>\n[*]Dungeons custom-created for this mode of play are likely to be quite linear. In case a more complex dungeon is desired (or adapted from a published source) I suggest the following rule: only consider the shortest route to victory through the dungeon when accounting for Difficulty Level. "Unnecessary" encounters don't count toward either average EL or # of encounters -- <b>but </b>if you discounted more than 1 encounter because of this rule, compute Difficulty Level as if # of encounters was 20-25% larger (minimum +1).<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>The flow of the game:</b> </i>I suggest that scenes are cut just after any Conflicts are declared, and that a whole "round" of scenes is framed by/for the other players before the Challenger delves into the dungeon for Conflict Resolution. This way, if any other Conflicts are declared involving additional Main characters, it is possible (at the discretion of the players involved) to bring the resolution of multiple Conflicts into just one dungeon!<br/>\nChallengers from all of the Conflicts to be resolved should then team-up, assembling an adventuring party picked from the Adventuring companions of them all for any leftover non-opposed player to control. Multiple (unrelated or semi-related) mission objectives are thus to be placed in the one dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155044/#Comment_155044" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T21:21:53+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  9:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are interesting ideas, Raffaele.  I've had similar thoughts about troupe style D&amp;D play.  I think this could work very well.  Here are some of my concerns though:<br><br>Part of the joy of D&amp;D is in levelling up your "guy" - this encompasses two things: the strong connection to a single character, and regular advancement for that character as a reward.  I wonder if this style of play will see too slow a reward cycle for this.  You'll only be playing your "main guy" once every four or five sessions, meaning you'll probably level with that character every eight sessions or so.  That's pretty slow.  What's more, that's eight sessions or more where you're facing the same average level of encounter.  I don't know if that's going to sustain interest.<br><br>I also wonder if the strongly team-based nature of 4e is going to work with the "main character"/"grog" divide that's working here.  It's very hard to see members of the team as anything other than equals, and the cameraderie of each contributing to the victory doesn't work as well when there's only one "main character".  I think that this kind of play might work better with 3e, where it's completely possible to have one "leveled" PC, and then a few PCs with NPC levels and such.  That would mechanically support the "main character"/"grog" split better, I think.<br><br>That said, I think it's a workable setup, and I'd like to hear what comes of it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155075/#Comment_155075" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T08:14:29+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  8:14AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I ever get to run D&amp;D; 4e, it will be this kind of setup, for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the problems you rightly stressed, I believe the whole thing to hinge on whether 4e was successful in streamlining the game enough that encounters don't take quite as long as in 3.x to resolve. What I'm aiming for, here, is for very short dungeons (let's say 2-3 combat encounters would be typical, with the occasional skill challenge etc. mixed in), an average session spanning like 2 of those (of course, my own standard-length D&amp;D; session is way longer than yours).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Character Optimization fan, I cheer at the thought of building a whole "stable" of characters: I usually have way more character "build" concepts in my head than I can ever hope to actually try out in a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for leveling rate concerns, a flat XP multiplier seems like the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost forgot...
