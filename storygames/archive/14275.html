That's like one word, though, just put "Fighter" with (General) in the classification.<br/><br/>* You don't list how many times you can reroll, but that's easily fixed too.<br/><br/>* Also, why can't someone train with a blindfold on or fight a shitload of invisible badguys and learn how to do this? By attaching it to blindness-in-play you kinda cut the shit out of some of the fun of shopping for feats to make a badass fighter. Or do you want to do that?<br/><br/>* 15 year old me is hitting me on the side of the head saying "what the fuck is a Zatoichi, do I even pronounce that "zatt-toy-yee-chee" or is it "zatt-toe-ee-chee" or what the fuck, why can't they just say I'm good at fighting shit I can't see, I dont know, fuck these guys".  I don't know if this is a fair criticism (i.e. like ours, your alternate-world D&amp;D3 is meant for a super-wide audience including 15 year old dopes who have no clue what that is), or if it's a bad criticism (i.e. your alternate-world version of D&amp;D3 is more flavorful and is no longer a fantasy-adventure toolkit, but instead a game tied directly to presenting a world and culture, so "Zatoichi" is totally normal and anyone reading the rest of it will totally get what "Zatoichi" is supposed to be about.)<br/><br/>I do think this example sort of proves my point insofar as this version is a cool analogue of the Blind-Fighting feat, but it gives up the very straightforward, pretty damn concise explanation of what it is. For example, the original version of the feat contains information about what a normal person who is trying to fight blind has to do, reminding us whether this is a "good buy" or not. Yours doesn't have that, it assumes we remember from elsewhere in the book what the normal situation is.  Now, is this information strictly necessary? It is not. Surely we remember with absolute 100% clarity every other rule in this book. But on the off chance someone is 15, or drunk, or just doesn't want to page back to double-check, the original text puts a reminder here. This is good teaching, the textbook analogy was picked for a reason.<br/><br/>I think I see what you're after here. You are trying to use the feat to get across a <i>vivid, unique fictional world</i>, whereas D&amp;D3 firmly puts that in the hands of the DM (and puts the tools for it in the DMG).  I think both approaches are valid and can be used to great effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324088/#Comment_324088" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T09:19:28+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  9:19AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2011 9:20AM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, one more: <blockquote><br/><b>Improved Initiative [General]</b><br/>Benefit<br/><br/>You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.<br/>Special<br/><br/>A fighter may select Improved Initiative as one of his fighter bonus feats. </blockquote>\n<b>Fly Agaric</b><br/><br/>Choose one:<br/>- Your time as a gladiatorial slave has taught you haste, lest you be crushed.<br/>- You live in constant fear of death, and cannot bear to let a fight go on any longer than it must.

That's not to say you can't teach elsewhere, or that you must use every effective teaching sentence you can think of, but you're not losing nothing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324105/#Comment_324105" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T10:40:12+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 10:40AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2011 7:37AM by jenskot.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I enjoyed reading your write up but it feels less like a rewrite and more changing what a feat is in D&amp;D 3E while dropping essential mechanical information. <br/><br/>A few points:<br/><br/>- Blind-Fight can be used by characters that are not blind.<br/><br/>- Which makes the Zatoichi title problematic. Plus Feat names that evoke a specific setting are generally reserved for feats that can only be taken if played in that setting.<br/><br/>- Blind-Fight rerolls only applies to melee attacks. It doesn't work with ranged attacks.<br/><br/>- Darkness and poor visibility reduce your speed to three-quarters normal speed. <br/><br/>- You removed the information for what happens if you don't have Blind-Fight. Because of the complexity of D&amp;D 3E, it's useful to include when selecting feats.<br/><br/>- Blind-Fight doesn't work against a character who is the subject of a blink spell.<br/><br/>- Fighters may select Blind-Fight as one of their fighter bonus feats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324107/#Comment_324107" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T10:44:32+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 10:44AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2011 10:45AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Blind-Fight [General] (142 words)</b><br/><br/><i>Pick one:</i><br/>\u2022\tYou were trained by a secret master. <i>What happened to him?</i><br/>\u2022\tYou were raised mostly in the dark.

Training is an optional rule that (IME) is rarely implemented. Plus, the DM is in charge of secret masters and magic gifts and stuff, and other players are in charge of what feat they take.<br/><br/>It's good, though! The normal practice in my group was to level up based on the kinds of things we'd been doing, so I can understand the desire to implement it in this way.  "I fought a shitload of invisible dudes in that last dungeon, this level-up I'm gettin' Blind Fighting."   <br/><br/>Maybe we are zooming out here to a "more interesting implementation of feats" challenge rather than just a "more interesting writeup" challenge. As I said in the earlier thread, there's lots of organizational, higher-level shit that can make these lower-level entries more interesting/different. It's one reason I don't really connect this challenge closely to my assertion that sometimes terse, simple language is better or at least as good as than interesting, vivid language, depending on your goals.  Like, it's clear that everyone from Zac to you wants to change <i>what Feats are</i>, not <i>how Feats are written</i>.  That's not a bad thing.  But it's a higher-level design decision. Those decisions ought to inform what kind of language is best/appropriate/workable.  For what you want feats to be, what you've written is way better than the original D&amp;D3 text, absolutely!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324113/#Comment_324113" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T11:11:48+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 11:11AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, yeah, Jason added some interesting choices that make the feat more awesome.

And, even better, three <i>boring as hell</i> feats.<br/><br/><b>Negotiator</b><br/>Your calm demeanor gives you a +2 bonus to Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks.<br/><br/><b>Nimble Fingers</b><br/>Your light touch gives you a +2 bonus on Disable Device and Open Lock checks.<br/><br/><b>Persuasive</b><br/>Your forceful personality gives you a +2 bonus to Bluff and Intimidate checks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each of these is 1 word longer than the previous version. Not bad. If you count the [General] tag, which I dropped since it seems implied on anything that's not otherwise tagged, it's even, same length.<br/><br/>First off, I condensed the wording a little, removed some redundant phrases. These feats read like legal text, designed to be bulletproof, not something to prompt gameplay.<br/><br/>Then, I added something to actually say what the feat is about. There was an entire article in Dragon a few years back about doing just this. It boiled down to "I took the Negotiator feat, what does that mean about me?" So I just baked a little bit of that into the feat, so taking it says something explicitly about the characters.<br/><br/>They're not much of an improvement, but at least there's some phrase there that's not purely mechanical. The original text feels like code:<br/>pc.DisableDeviceBonus += 2; // I don't think we lost any information from the original here.<br/>                                            // At least with my rewrite there's some flavor that we can't reduce to code.<br/><br/><br/>Looking at a lot of these feats, they'd be less painful to read if they just edited them down some. They all read like everyone playing is going to be trying to misread them. I mean, take Eschew Materials:<br/><br/><i>You can cast any spell that has a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. (The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.) If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component at hand to cast the spell, just as normal.</i><br/><br/>I think you can rewrite that much more briefly, but with very little loss of specificity:<br/><br/><i>If a spell requires a material component costing 1gp or less, you can cast the spell without that component. Any component costing more than 1gp is still needed.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324117/#Comment_324117" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T11:40:54+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 11:40AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well done, I agree you've got three solid rewrites there. <br/><br/>And yep, definitely conciseness is good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324121/#Comment_324121" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T11:48:24+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 11:48AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, and it is duly noted that I have no idea what feats are for.

My "narrative requirements" were intentionally written so that they could apply at any point in the game (aside form the one about being raised in a monastery), so we could probably merge his and my feats to make one that's really solid.<br/><br/>To answer JD's questions more directly, this is what I saw when I looked at the original feat (i.e. the "boring" parts I was trying to fix):<br/><br/><b>First</b>, it repeats a lot of stuff that should be succinctly listed on the character sheet or a condition card regarding the rules for fighting or moving in the dark.  While JD likes this, since it shows that the feat is valuable, 1) ALL feats should be valuable, not just some; and 2) just thinking about what fighting in the dark or against invisible enemies must be like, you can understand how hard that would normally be.  The text of the feat takes something that's intuitively cool and breaks it down into fixed, boring stats and modifiers, which is one of the things I loathe about "traditional" games.  Like how Batman's power in d20 is apparently to be able to attack every enemy adjacent to a square he moves over. WTF. He's the GDBatman!  Instead, I tried to stick to real language for the most part (much more exciting and evocative than numbers!), descibing what the move does and assuming that the details for fighting in the dark or against invisible things would be listed elsewhere.<br/><br/><b>Second</b>, there's no sense of how or why the character does this.  Do they have special training? Are they a blind samurai? Do they have crazy Daredevil senses?  Lots of interesting stuff there, but the game suggests that it doesn't matter. Just pick your feats already; we're all waiting for you to finish your character so we can start killing things.  This also means that if you pick the feat later in the game, it can just come out of nowhere, with no fictional justification or fictional requirements you have to fulfill before you can take it.  Lame.  Sure, the GM could set some, but the GM has enough to do in games like this already.<br/><br/><b>Third</b>, what good does this "Benefit / Normal / Special" distinction do anyway? None that I can see.  It's just more jargon that's opaque to new folks.<br/><br/><b>Fourth</b>, I really wanted a break from the names of 3E feats, a good 50% of which seem to be "that's what she said" jokes. This HAS to be intentional because otherwise people at WOTC are way stupider than I thought.  Clearly this is some kind of attempt at appealing to middle school boys.  Rather than making the middle school boys giggle, I thought it would be neat to direct them toward some badass media that they wouldn't otherwise encounter.  Hence, "Zatoichi."  They can Google it and find the reference instantly.  Boom, a little bit of culture or trivia that they can lord over their friends.<br/><br/><b>Fifth</b>, I wanted a place for the players to actually interact with the text and the content of the feat, especially if that involved them generating imaginary content that would feed play.  Hence, all the "narrative requirements" also specifically call on the players to generate content.  In most cases, I was figuring that at least a couple of interesting NPCs or situations would come out of these questions.  They are also all "bad" things, but let the players say what they are, following Vincent's suggestion that players don't get to "lose AND lose."  So the player gets to say what terrible thing he saw, what got him kicked out of the monastery, or how he was blinded by a rival.  They could definitely all serve as "bangs" too, ways of kicking off a campaign or a new arc.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's what I was trying to do.  I like a lot of the other suggestions and thoughts as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324827/#Comment_324827" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T18:20:51+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  6:20PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I know what Zatoichi is, it's badass, but 15 year old me doesn't.

What sounds awesome on a forum post may not hold up in actual play. For example...<br/><br/>- If I'm looking at a single feat, not knowing what "Zatoichi" means isn't a problem. I can look it up. <br/>- When I don't know how the default rules work if I don't buy a feat (thus I can't weight the feat's exact benefits), I can look it up. <br/><br/>But, when I'm pouring through 100s of feats... sometimes in the middle of a game... looking up all of that information isn't plausible. And this scenario is not uncommon. <br/><br/>D&amp;D 3E was rigorously playtested. More so that 4E. There is a reason they made these decisions. And there is a reason D&amp;D 3E is either the second or third best selling RPGs ever (easily outselling 4E). Now I personally prefer 4E to 3E. And I prefer Jonathan's feat writing style. But I know that my personal tastes are not widespread and if I was working at Wizards of the Coast and weighing my personal tastes against what the RPG audience wants... I would go with my audience over my personal interests. And if WotC hires me to rewrite their feat text, I'm not going to redesign the function to fit my desired form unless that was the task at hand. <br/><br/>I'm speaking from years working as a creative director in an age of unprecedented usability testing. In the past, people mainly guessed what was effective visual or interactive design. No longer. I've been continually amazed how if you show a group of professional designers 2 designs... and then put those designs through strenuous usability testing... often the design the designers instinctively prefer is not the design that is the most effective. It's quite humbling and I've even seen designers quit because they couldn't stand the realities of their work.<br/><br/>In independant publishing, you can focus on your own personal interests without worrying about pleasing a large audience... which can be very freeing and personally rewarding. But that isn't what WotC is dealing with which is why they sometimes make decisions which may seem backwards to us individually but work on a larger scale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324896/#Comment_324896" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T08:25:35+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  8:25AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>John:</b> That's cool and all, and I definitely appreciate your firsthand insight.

It's not a minority that dislikes this approach.<br/><br/>It's subjective. <br/><br/>Asking "is something exciting?" relies completely on asking\u2026 "for who?"<br/><br/>For me, your approach to writing is very exciting. For Wizards of the Coast during the 3E era, after extensively studying their fan base, found that approach wouldn't work. And 3E was incredibly successful. More so than 2E or 4E. It's not creating for the lowest common human denominator. If that was their interest, they wouldn't be working in RPGs. It's not that profitable! But they knew who their audience was and made a game they wanted. And their audience loved it and found it incredibly exciting. Feats was one of the biggest selling points of 3E. Feats were their killer app.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324927/#Comment_324927" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T10:48:32+00:00" title="May 17, 2011 10:48AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2011 10:50AM by sage.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>A lot of people hate the descriptive text in 4E powers and it was one of the reasons (not the only reason) people switched to Pathfinder. And a shocking, industry shaking number of people abandoned 4E for Pathfinder. It's not a minority that dislikes this approach.</blockquote>\nWell, a majority dislikes the 4E power fluff text, but then again so do I, and I like Jonathan's approach. I think that instance of grafted on "flavor" in 4E powers is not representative of how flavor could be added to feats, powers, etc. well.<br/><br/>In my mind, a 4E power with flavor ends up looking a lot more like an AW move.<br/><br/>Going with the rewriting theme, let's take a 1st level Fighter power (from vanilla 4E, I don't have Essentials handy):<br/><b>Sure Strike</b> <i>Fighter Attack 1</i><br/><i>You trade power for precision</i><br/><b>At-Will * Martial, Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action     Melee</b> weapon<br/><b>Target:</b> One creature<br/><b>Attack:</b> Strength+2 vs. AC<br/><b>Hit:</b> 1[W] damage.<br/><br/>My flavorful, possible unpalatable to many hardcore players, rewrite might be:<br/><b>Sure Strike</b> <i>Martial, Weapon</i><br/><b>Class:</b> Fighter<br/><b>Level:</b> 1<br/><b>Uses:</b> At-will<br/><b>Action:</b> Standard<br/>When you take careful aim for a single, focused melee basic attack, you can find an opening: make your basic attack with +2 to your attack roll.<br/><br/><br/>So, yeah, this isn't just rephrasing. It relies on "basic attack" being a stronger idea, not just a fall back that no-one uses, and it makes the power a modifier to your basic attack. I think this would be a bit more palatable to the 3E crowd. It's a little like a 3E spell writeup.<br/><br/>Beyond mixing up the format and concepts, it also puts what you do fictionally and what happens mechanically on equal footing in the writeup. To me, that feels better. It also feels more like spells in 3E.<br/><br/>Really, I just wanted to see if we could do this same exercise with 4E powers, and to maybe show that there are options for adding flavor that don't boil down to a line of italic text that no one reads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324940/#Comment_324940" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T11:54:54+00:00" title="May 17, 2011 11:54AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played any d20 games, but it seems like attaching as much fiction to each feat as Jonathan wants to isn't appropriate for how feats are actually used in the game. By the end of the game won't a 3E character have like a dozen feats (and even more if he's a Fighter)? Won't a character with a dozen fictional hooks on the level of Zatoichi seem really bloated and unwieldy? It also seems to ignore that feats are a level-up reward -- players will frequently have a fictional context for why they're getting more powerful (the dozen goblins, orc priest, and family of owlbears they fought to level up), so hooking in an off-screen side story based on feat selection may not fit well into the game as played. Jonathan's feat writeups read like something more akin to a d20 class than a d20 feat. I guess I'm just hopping on the "you're redesigning the game, not rewording the feats" bandwagon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324951/#Comment_324951" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T12:33:48+00:00" title="May 17, 2011 12:33PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

The current 4E power descriptions are a very elegant way of communicating something like that, whereas something like:<br/><br/>"When you take careful aim for a single, focused melee basic attack, you can find an opening: make your basic attack with +2 to your attack roll but do not add your ability modifier to damage."<br/><br/>is considerably less elegant.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure how your example is more flavourful than the original ...

I put some thought into it over the past month or so, and I have come up with a few ideas myself. I hope it's not bad form to resurrect this thread with a few ideas.<br/><br/><b>PRESTIGE CLASSES</b><br/>This idea's straightforward: use the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/testBasedPrerequisites.htm" rel="nofollow">test-based prerequisites from Unearthed Arcana</a><br/><br/><b>MAGIC</b><br/>This requires doing a lot more violence to the system than the other changes, but the basic idea is: sorcery and magic never fail. Where you would fail, you succeed but in a nasty or unpleasant way. Spells and powers have suggestions for 'fumbles', but the DM is also free to invent his/her own.<br/><br/>I think this fits in with conventional role-playing because magic has always been given more narrative flexibility than skills or combat. For example, wizards are expected to invent new spells whereas fighters aren't expected to invent new feats. Spell misfires aren't part of the core rules, but they commonly pop up.<br/><br/><b>FEATS</b><br/>To qualify for a feat, you must have done something amazing. Obviously, what\u2019s amazing or not is subjective, so you need to make your case to your fellow players. If they agree that it\u2019s amazing, you can take the feat.<br/><br/>You don\u2019t have to select a feat right away. You can save that option for as long as you like. You could even wait until you do something amazing and then immediately take a feat.<br/><br/><i>Comments</i><br/>I think there's some cool stuff hidden here.<br/><br/>Players have their decisions limited to what's actually going on in the game. For example, I'd be surprised if many people benefited from Far Shot because few battles are at such long range. By requiring a successful attack at long range, the game subtly stops people from selecting that feat if range is never an issue.<br/><br/>It highlights what the characters have done rather than what they will do. In this way, it replaces generic training rules but still gives a sense that characters are learning from their actions.<br/><br/><i>Feats</i> (I'm working through the SRD ones <a href="http://www.yearoflivingfree.info/story6:feats" rel="nofollow">here</a>)<br/><b>Agile</b><br/>You found your way out a tight spot.<br/><br/><b>Alertness</b><br/>You noticed something everyone else missed.<br/><br/><b>Armour Proficiency (Heavy)</b><br/>You fought in heavy armour for a day. Requires: Armour Proficiency (Medium).<br/><br/><b>Blind-Fight</b><br/>You fought bravely and well despite being unable to see.<br/><br/><b>Cleave</b><br/>You killed three creatures in three turns.<br/><br/><b>Endurance</b><br/>You were the only one to resist an environmental effect.<br/><br/><b>Extra Turning</b><br/>You used all your available turning attempts.<br/><br/><b>Far Shot</b><br/>You hit an enemy at far range.<br/><br/><b>Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</b><br/>In the one round, you killed two enemies \u2013 one with each weapon. Requires: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
