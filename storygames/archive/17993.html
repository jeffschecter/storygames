Six players in each session.<br/><br/>It resulted in some of the greatest Star Wars gaming I've ever participated in, either as a player or a GM.<br/><br/>Really spectacular stuff as the AW engined allowed us to easily access the big fiction moments, cutting to the essence of scenes, allowing for huge amounts of player agency and being able to explore the conflicts in terrific, non-whiff factor ways. <br/><br/>Obviously this sort of thing is par for the course for the AW engine -- I've been using it for years, as both GM and player, and my experiences have been overall quite good. AW native, Monsterhearts, Dungeon World, Monster of the Week, all great stuff. Tremulus wasn't that successful for me for various reasons I've explained in another thread (tl;dr - moves as written left much to be desired) but, yea, overall (well-written) AW-hacks in general have served me very well indeed.<br/><br/>Re: the con games, as the players choose playbooks and we all discussed what amounted to an informal social contract -- time period was going to be between Ep4 and Empire Strikes Back, PCs positively linked to rebel activity, tone was going to be Empire Strikes Back in feel -- yea sure fantastical space opera with all sorts of big idea sci-fi awesomeness but kind of gritty, a universe where you can freeze to death, where you can get your hand cut off, where good guys can be betrayed. Plus the Star Wars World hack has these freaking amazing death moves and it would have been a privilege to see those happen during the course of play.<br/><br/>I listened to character intros, poked and prodded and we eventually came up with the idea of these folks being part of their own rebel activity against the Empire.  That gave us a vague sense of what... but where remained unspoken.<br/><br/>It was a con game so I wanted to give things shape and form. To that end, in both sessions I began the players off in Blackbird-style, locked away in cells on board an Imperial space station. <br/>Which was The Death Star. <br/>And this was the Battle of Yavin.<br/><br/>Now everyone knew this place was going to blow-up so there was huge time pressure.<br/><br/>The Operative playbook was in play both times, so were a couple droids (not playbooks in the hack but they were skinned as droids) and so these PCs weren't locked up but were, for whatever pro-Rebel reason, infiltrators onboard the Death Star.<br/><br/>So hijinks ensue and they escape before the DS blows up.<br/><br/>The hack allowed for some genuine innovation and folks were reading charged situations, Assaulting when they best see fit, threatening, manipulating, Acting Under Fire, etc.<br/><br/>Great.<br/><br/>In both games, I wanted escape from the Death Star to be action-filled and a how-to manual on the AW-engine approach to fiction creation. I knew what the first half of the game was going to be -- char gen and Death Star mayhem.<br/><br/>The second half I left wide open and I really, really wanted the players to figure it out for themselves. They had some adventure seeds planted in their backgrounds of course but I didn't want to shove them into one thing or another or felt they had to 'go on the GM's adventure' now. I figured I'd improv whatever and, frankly, most of the enjoyment I get from GMing nowadays results from not knowing what story the PCs are going to end up telling *me*.<br/><br/>First session had the PCs escape and help with the Battle of Yavin, taking on Vader's Tie-Fighter in the trench, doing all sorts of cool starship battle stuff with the AW-engine moves now fueled by ship combat that still would have taken most any other game (even ones that aren't strictly trad) quite a bit of die rolling and necessary abstraction. This group goes to help win the day, blow up the Death Star (yea, fuck canon), save Yavin, etc. 2nd half of the game was a rather fun escapade onto Coruscant to figure out exactly what nefarious thing was happening to the Jedi Temple: this came about because there were a few Force-users in play and one thing kind of led to another as to the who/what/why of this plot-line and their investigation/confrontation with bad stuff on Coruscant.<br/><br/>Let me be clear here -- the moves were dictating the fiction of the rest of the session and were being used beyond 'in the moment' scale. e.g. The Operative  and the Consular both figured out things were rotten at the Core in a very specific way and decided to take action in very specific ways dictated by the answers to the question they asked from Moves such as Read a Charged situation and hard choices presented to them from marginal Act Under Pressure roles (game calls it Do Something Under Pressure).<br/><br/>The second session had the same set-up re: Escape from the Death Star.<br/><br/>But this time the Scoundrel convinced everyone to simply split and not help with the battle or help the Rebels in any concrete way.<br/><br/>So the Rebels lost.<br/>Yavin was destroyed.<br/>The Alliance loses most of the leadership.<br/>It's a giant, crushing defeat.<br/><br/>I did this because I liked the idea of the PCs kind of being the lynchpin in the Battle. I didn't tell them they were the lynchpin, however.<br/><br/>So the PCs end up on a back up Rebel base on Hoth that has about a 30 guys on there despairing about a future.<br/><br/>So were the PCs. They struggled to find a way forward. (honestly, the players were fairly freaked out canon had been changed).<br/><br/>They pretty quickly went to their moves and playbooks to figure out a way to author the fiction forward. It was one of those defining moments that serve as pristine examples that SYSTEM FUCKING MATTERS and the game would not have moved forward in the same way, with the same ease and interest with another system.  Because the players started to use the Moves on a grand scale, both geographically and temporally.<br/><br/>In scene snippets and montages, the PCs broke off into groups and began using Moves *across the the Galaxy and over the course of a year* to rebuild the Rebel Alliance.<br/><br/>They're feeding into each other's Moves, One group making it possible for another Group to do their thing.<br/><br/>Any one of these Moves could be the rest of the game. I wanted something to result in an action-scenario, something we could play out for the rest of the session for some definitive Star Wars action.<br/><br/>Finally, what results is the Jedi struggling to persuade a lynchpin group of Rebels that he's the new face of the Alliance, that he can lead them to some kind of victory even as they all struggle with trying to figure out what the next step is.  They'll agree to unite and take the risk of definitively exposing their existence to the Empire but the Jedi players rolls a 7 and the folks he's trying to convince need some kind of concrete assurance he can deliver on what he's promising.<br/><br/>And right then and there, with the Move dictating this course of action, we realize we have our adventure scenario for the second half of the session.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406578/#Comment_406578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-19T01:33:20+00:00" title="February 19, 2013  1:33AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>To make a long story short, the group figures out a way to steal Vader's almost-completed flagship Super-Star Destroyer from a giant orbital ring shipyards facility surrounding Kashyyyk and free the tens of thousands of Wookies that are being used as slave-labor to build the Empire's fleets. I'll point out that the Wookies were led by another PC who was Wookie nobility who had rolled a 6 on a Read a Charged Situation on another world during her phase of the 'reinvigorate the Rebel alliance' mission and gotten her ass captured by the Empire and shipped back to Kashyyyk. But it set up these gigantic Threaten and Assault moves that she carried out when the time came for the uprising.<br/><br/>Basically, the Jedi and the PCs show up to a meeting with the doubting fringe Rebels, with ten thousand Wookies crewing a Super-Star Destroyer.  The NPC group, jaws-dropping as they see what the Heroes have done, now had their 'concrete assurance' as dictated by the Move and were convinced by the Jedi.<br/><br/>The Rebel Alliance had been restarted<br/><br/>So, yea, epic.<br/><br/>You know things are clicking when one of the players exclaims "This should be a movie!"<br/><br/>Thank you Players, the AW-engine and Pheylorn for a great hack. We loved every fucking minute of it and the way in which the Moves snowballed and played on each other -- players Moves, my Soft and Hard Moves -- was magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ATXrds" title="ATXrds"><img alt="ATXrds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ATXrds">ATXrds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406583/#Comment_406583" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-19T04:10:10+00:00" title="February 19, 2013  4:10AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the write up.

This was so awesome to read <a href="/forums/profile/Denys">@Denys</a>!! I love love love the games you ran, it makes me wish I both lived in LA and could have played in them.<br/><br/>It makes me feel all warm and tingly to know this hack was played and enjoyed, especially in a con setting which I always find to be the hardest kind of game to GM/MC/DM. I've also run this at a local con a few months ago in two slots and had some really great experiences. It is amazing how much fiction they AW-engine allows you to cram into a 4-hour slot. Just boggles the mind. The previously mentioned game <a href="/forums/profile/NorthernWolf">@NorthernWolf</a> refers to has been played for probably 8+ sessions and I've had the privilege of being a player to an amazing MC who has done such a wonderful job. I am getting to play a Star Wars protagonist (Consular turned Noble) who struggles with her empathy and the dark side temptations that go along with it. Even to the point of having abandoned the Jedi order to pursue her own course that she considers a higher calling. I *NEVER* would have done this in a traditional star wars game where I always felt forced to play a shining knight jedi or a dark sider psychopath. It's been so liberating and has just been so super fun. Plus, sex moves? Who doesn't love em? <br/><br/>Thanks again Denys for both trying out the hack and taking time out of your life to write this recap for us to enjoy. It really is appreciated and you have made me beam a bright smile this day. I hope your future experiences with the game are equally, if not more, enjoyable! I can't take much credit though, V.Baker designed the perfect game for me and I am simply borrowing from his genius to make his engine work in settings I adore and want to explore. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Pheylorn/Drew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mook" title="Mook"><img alt="Mook" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mook">Mook</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407496/#Comment_407496" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T10:01:17+00:00" title="February 27, 2013 10:01AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent write-ups, <a href="/forums/profile/Denys">@Denys</a> - I've also done a lot of Star Wars gaming, and I agree ... this was one of the best!
