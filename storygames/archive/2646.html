It would be awesome to make a One-Shot Podcast about the local convention, interviewing people and so on, and <br/><br/>2. I have no idea how to do that.<br/><br/>In fact, I have not much knowledge of the behind-the-scenes stuff of podcasting in general, so I thought I'd ask here. (As there are a few podcasters who post here.) <br/><br/>What I know so far: Podcasts are basically mp3 files where people talk about stuff. On a computer, you record stuff with a microphone in .wav format and the convert it to the smaller mp3 format befor uploading it to some host so people can download it. I know that some VoIP clients have the option of recording the calls. (Teamspeak has it built in, Skype has an extension for it, IIRC.)<br/><br/>So I know the general, theoretical stuff behind it, but I'd love to know more about the concrete, practical aspects. Like, what software to you use to record? What kind of set-up? (Multiple Pcs and Mikes? Recorded VoIP calls?) Anybody doing something with portable gadgets? (I'm sure there are digital recording machine that export to pcs or something.) Is it expensive?<br/><br/>Me=Curious.

The hard part is editing. I recommend Adobe Audition, but the free Audacity is good in a pinch. Then, as stated, you know the rest.<br/><br/>The OgreCave Audio Report uses a program called HotRecorder to record a live Skype call to a WAV file. It does a nice trick where I am on the left channel of the stereo file, and everyone who's remote from me is on the right. This is why you never hear me cough over Allan or Chris, but you hear their noises over each other sometimes.<br/><br/>The very best thing in Adobe Audition is a menu item called Dynamics Processing, which lets you amplify different <i>microscopic instances of sound</i> a different amount depending on how loud they are already, automatically. All you have to do is draw a curve saying that the stuff that's yay high already should stay yay high, and the stuff higher should be almost to the top of the VU meter, unless it already is, in which case leave it there. It is pretty intuitive once you are looking at it, and without it the OCAR would sound much shittier than it does. (Note: what I have described is also called "compression" by audio nerds.)<br/><br/>Then, upload monaural MP3 files (that aren't encoded to a too-nutso-high bitrate - 56k is probably fine) to a host that is okay with your big ol' files being there. The cool kids are using libsyn.com and OCAR may switch there too before long.<br/><br/>Hope this is more helpful than it is confusing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60844/#Comment_60844" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T11:43:23+00:00" title="March 13, 2007 11:43AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey!

In practice, it's not always the case (depending on the podcast, like my own Master Plan), but the nice thing about RSS is that if it has an irregular schedule, you can just plug that into any podcatcher (like iTunes) and whenever there's a new podcast, you know about it.  Much cooler than checking back regularly to see if they've updated.  Viva la RSS feeds!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite><br/>So I know the general, theoretical stuff behind it, but I'd love to know more about the concrete, practical aspects.

(I'm sure there are digital recording machine that export to pcs or something.) Is it expensive?</blockquote>\nMy take here:<br/><br/>For my sessions now, I have a Behringer MXB1002 mixing board.  It can take three 9-volt batteries, so I can cart it with me to conventions and record wherever.  I have two mics and can do an interview in my living room, but since most game designers don't live in Sacramento, I also have Hotrecorder which I use with Skype.  I was very, very happy when I found that it splits the conversation into two separate channels.  It all currently goes into my desktop PC's on-board sound card's line-in via the mixing board's Tape Out ports (as I had some spare RCA cable handy) -- at least one of those two is the culprit of my current line noise problem, so there will be some swapping out in the near future.<br/><br/>It *can* be expensive, just like any hobby, but the buy-in is ridiculously cheap.  A $5 or $10 mic (I highly advise against a headset mic, but if you got it, try it), Audacity or Garage Band, and (if you want) a $5/mo Libsyn account and you're good to go.  That didn't stop me from dropping a lot more money on more equipment, but the low buy-in can help you determine if this is something you'd want to pursue and put more money into.<br/><br/>Oh, and another thing you'll want to ask when it comes to podcasting -- and I got severely burned when I didn't realize this and didn't ask before I bought a bunch of stuff -- is ask <i>where</i> someone podcasts.  I basically duplicated half of Paul Tevis's setup where we were talking, but didn't realize that he records in his den and I have to record in my living room (which is a third-story apartment, eye-level to two freeways a block and a half away, with only a pane of glass between me and the sound), so the mics I bought pick up too much to be usable.

While expensive from a just-getting-started point of view (around $140), it's cheap as mics go and very, very versatile. It supports different recording patterns, which means you can easily use the same mic for getting audio from an entire room, a conversation, or just one person. USB based and a bit bulky but I've been impressed.<br><br>Software-wise, Levellator has been good to me. Free, open source, it does a good job of automatically dropping background noise and dealing with multiple people, at multiple volumes.<br><br>I've been using Garageband for recording and found it to be adequate, if a bit strange (2 gig file size limit?).

I mean we're talking about a mono, MP3 here with people just talking.  Does a quality mic really make that much of a difference?<br/><br/>I've got lots to learn with sound editing and arriving at the best quality for sure, but I honestly can't tell the difference from podcasts that use fancy mics to ones that don't.  What's the real story here?  Is this like wine, a function of taste and experience and thus very subjective or is there a real difference that can actually affect the overall quality (and thus appreciation of your podcast)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263298/#Comment_263298" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T22:29:16+00:00" title="March 21, 2010 10:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Robert">@Robert</a>: does levelator and normalizing remove the need to compress?</blockquote>I think he's talking about the <i>effect</i> compression rather than mp3 compression.<br/><br/>Franck, I'd imagine that levelator is a brickwall limiter, which is a type of high ratio compression that gets as much volume as possible without going over.<br/><br/>I'm going to suggest that all you guys take a look at CockOs Reaper, which is what I and all of my pro-audio friends are using for recording these days. It's free (kinda, there's a 6-sec nag screen if you go over 30 days, but it's fully functional), and there are lots of really good effects plugins that come with it.<br/><br/>There are lots of VST (virtual studio technology) plugins out there for free. What I'd suggest is a "channel strip" which combines compression, limiting, noise gate, and equalization into one package. There are usually some decent presets.<br/><br/>@ Walker: I'm really impressed with those $40 USB mics. Studios have known for years that cheap little condenser mics are a great bang for the buck. On the other hand, there is a very real difference when I record with my Oktava MK-219 large-diaphragm condenser.<br/><br/>If anyone is interested, I've been working with digital audio recording since Cakewalk 7, around 12 or 13 years ago. I'm a professional musician, and I'm the go-to guy for digital recording at the music store where I teach. I'm new to the whole podcasting thing, but I have the recording technology nailed.

I had a very short-lived podcast (about six 20-minute episodes) and I think three of those were CharCon podcasts (and two of them were a two-part interview with Fred Hicks at Origins). I just used a hand-held digital voice recorder and Audacity. Even that proved to be a little too complex for me, which is why I quit doing the podcast. But being able to do interviews before and at CharCon was pretty neat, and if the convention would agree to host the files, I likely would do it again just for them.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
