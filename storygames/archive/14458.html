If so, how was it achieved and did it work for you? If not, would you like to see asymmetic play? What sort of games would it work well in? Is there a potential for an RPG designed to incorporate asymmetric play? What would that game be about and how would it work?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>For example, imagine a party tasked with safely transporting the Chosen One across dangerous terrain. Most of the party act as normal, engaging in conflicts when they arise and rolling dice to check how effective they are, but the Chosen One only operates by bestowing gifts or curses upon those whom they wish to affect, they never get to act directly against any foe. Therefore, the other players have to persuade the Chosen One that they are most worthy of his gifts, at which point normal intra-party conflicts may enter play. </i><br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and suggesting "GMs represent asymmetric play" is weak sauce. Imagine the GM as the embodiment of the game system: they are the hardware that the game 'runs on', not a player in this case, ok?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329114/#Comment_329114" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T06:15:59+00:00" title="June 11, 2011  6:15AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a tricky design challenge, because you're really talking about different kinds of fun for various players.
