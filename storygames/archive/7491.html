What was THAT? What WAS that?" It was called P.I.: Paranormal Investigations.<br/><br/>We had two hosts, one who was a complete bullshit artist, who was guided by the ghost of his former partner from when they were garbagemen, and the other who was a has-been actor who was a drunk, a slob, and a lech. We had the producer, who was in way over her head because the original producer had been fired, and she'd been promoted. There was also the camera guy who was an aspiring film maker and felt this show was beneath him, and lastly we had the ghost of an actor who had been the host of an "In Search Of" style show in the 40's that was determined to make this show fail because of his ego.<br/><br/>I won't go through the whole things, but definite highlights included:<br/>-The camera guy deciding that filming this show falling apart and never getting on air was going to be his first great work, and then actively sowing dischord.<br/>-The crew being chased out of the haunted toy store by the angry ghosts they were trying to film.<br/>-A really terrific angry phone call from the producer to the mystic consultant of the show about them getting stuck in rush hour traffic for three hours and missing a shoot on her advice. The player who played that npc really made us laugh.<br/><br/>Mostly I just love introducing folks to this sort of play. I'm not interested so much in making converts, as I am in letting people know that this kind of play exists, and then letting them do with it what they will.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166495/#Comment_166495" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T14:40:22+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  2:40PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great, Ogre.
