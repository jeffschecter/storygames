In Send Your Light, you must cope with these temptations, without straying along the path to sin.<br/><br/>Send Your Light is a storytelling game consisting of a 55-card deck, comprising Character Cards and Temptation Cards. The finished product will be sold online and in Christian stores across the country.</i><br/><br/>It's not an entirely stupid idea, of course. Christian products sell very well and "Christian story game" isn't a bad niche to occupy.<br/><br/>And, well, Joe did ask for "alternatives to a standardized and mundane marketing and publishing market", so it's his fault.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106514/#Comment_106514" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T09:34:08+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  9:34AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice start, Graham!<br/><br/>The game wouldn't be <i>just</i> a card deck, would it?

(I'm not certain if this is a concern in Christian stores.) Also with a 110 card deck, there are additional cards for more variety in play. The downside with the larger deck (and indeed, any game with cards) is you're going to have to hire an artist to create artwork for all those cards -- this will increase your manufacturing costs. A way to produce WWJD?/SyL cheaper is to reuse card art on several cards, much like how Bang! reuses art on Missed! cards, which makes up the bulk of the game's deck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106539/#Comment_106539" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T12:00:40+00:00" title="November  4, 2007 12:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas D</cite>The downside with the larger deck (and indeed, any game with cards) is you're going to have to hire an artist to create artwork for all those cards -- this will increase your manufacturing costs.

Since there are centuries and centuries of Christian-themed artwork out there, that could save some money.  Of course, you'd still need art direction and layout, but there should still be some savings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106541/#Comment_106541" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T12:03:56+00:00" title="November  4, 2007 12:03PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For marketing, don't demo this at conventions and game stores, demo it in living rooms.
