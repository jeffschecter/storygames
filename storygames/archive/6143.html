Loads of feedback, comment, advice and suggestions from all over the place. The game has really been kicked into shape in quite a serious way. I'd say it's 80-90% done. <br/><br/>But, there's always room for those final tweaks and improvements. There are a couple of bits that I know probably need modification and it's always good to have further viewpoints. So here's a thing: I'm keen to see if there is anyone out there who would be able to run a session or two during the month of April. <br/><br/>Here's some preamble about the game (taken, incidentaly, from the 'Player's Primer' that will form part of the book':<br/><br/><i>The game is set in London, England, during the winter of 1963. In October of 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis caused the world to be enveloped in war conducted using nuclear weapons and 'twisted technologies' that bordered on the occult.These technologies were first created in Germany during World War Two and were secretly plundered in the war's aftermath. Since then, Britain, France, the USA and the USSR have all secretly worked to understand and improve on these technologies.<br/><br/>Some examples of the technology are:<br/><br/>\tHuman experimentation, where people are hideously warped and deformed into creatures of nightmare.<br/><br/>\tBringing entities through from 'other places', using 'gates' or 'holes' in space and time.<br/><br/>During the Hot War, Britain was subject to nuclear and twisted technology attack. London was only straddled with nuclear weapons, but was the scene of vicious battles involving Soviet twisted technology invasion forces. There are now no communications from the North of England, Scotland, Ireland or continental Europe. The Government still has nominal control, but there is great factionalisation.<br/><br/>The civil authorities, the military, scientific agencies and police are all attempting to gain the upper hand in the re-building and survival process. There are huge numbers of refugees from other parts of the UK and Europe held in squalid camps in the Thames Estuary.<br/><br/>Food, fuel, clean water and other vital resources are all heavily rationed and controlled by civil and military authorities. Xenophobia, mistrust and outright racism are rife in London.<br/><br/>Characters in the game all work for the Special Situations Group (SSG), an organisation that hunts down monsters, terrorists, spies and saboteurs. The SSG is riddled with competing factions, all attempting to use and subvert it for their own ends.<br/><br/>The real core of the game is peoples hidden agendas and secret desires, coupled to the need to build relationships in the aftermath of a great disaster.</i><br/><br/>If you think you'd be interested in the game, and able to run even just one session, please do let me know, either in this thread or at: contestedground [at] gmail [dot] com.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
