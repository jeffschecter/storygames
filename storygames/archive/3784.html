Start a new thread with the title "Help me understand [Bunnies and Burrows]" or similar. Don't post in this thread, as it would get messy, but feel free to bump it with a link to your thread so it doesn't disappear off the map.<br/><br/>Thus, critique of the game can be given with your experience as the focus, rather than the game as the focus.<br/><br/>It has been my experience that whatever you're discussing, approaching the subject matter as "this didn't work for me, please help" is much more constructive than "this product is bad, everyone stay away".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84925/#Comment_84925" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T07:22:37+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  7:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "Help me understand Burning Empires" thread can be found <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3780" rel="nofollow">here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
