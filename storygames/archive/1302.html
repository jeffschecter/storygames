                    So, here are the pieces so far:<br/><br/>Note, I'm folding <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/ClaireBickellsheetonly.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> so that the bottom three panels form a triangular prism, with the top panel sticking out at the top, giving three possible orientations of the sheet.<br/><br/>Players play - (variously depending on the position of their character sheet)<br/>a) Scholars searching for coded meaning within their holy work<br/>b) The main character in the scholar's decoding of the work.<br/>c) The underlying truth revealed in that decoding.<br/>(In a strange way this is close to making stance a mechanical toggle)<br/><br/>The work in question must be one of the following:<br/>a) A non-existent work<br/>b) A work all the players have heard of, but none has read / investigated<br/>a) A work all the players know very well, e.g. have recently read.<br/><br/>The game has two phases, of competing re-tellings:<br/>1) Mapping the cosmos - where in the spheres are placed on the map, showing the structure of universe, from top to bottom.<br/>2) The lightning strikes - where the spheres are ascended according to the path of creation and gnosis. <br/><br/>In phase 1 - the the work is re-told and examined semi-linearly, with branchings and reversals permitted (each step adding another link to the map, using the links within each player's sheet).<br/>In phase 2 - the work is re-told in linearly and in reverse, a final telling.<br/><br/>Other than tracking on the map, the crux of the game are the 9 spheres or constellations appearing on each character sheet. At any given time 3 are revealed, 3 are seen, and 3 are hidden. For example, as the scholar, the aspect trio is revealed to the other players, the introspect trio are seen only by the player, and the inspect trio are hidden. These will change, based on the state of the sheet, and hence based on which character is being portrayed. <br/><br/>A link in the map occurs from a revealed sphere, and the corresponding seen one. This causes the seen to become revealed, and the revealed to become hidden. This initiated by another player to conclude their part of a narration, and to pass it to the next player (who has just changed state). <br/><br/>Alternatively, during a narration, a non-narrating player can contest a narration, if so, the narrator can give in, causing no change, or request that the contesting player change state to pay for the change. The revealed spheres in that state change must support the contest in that case (still working on this part - spheres are meant to be thematic)<br/><br/>On the map, each player has a pawn, which charts the path down. When all the pawns reach the bottom sphere, then the lightning strike begins. For this all players share a single pawn, ascending back up. <br/><br/>Special note - the oval contains the character name, and the lines contain a short description of the work with that character as central. Neither the truth or the scholar is written on the sheet, because as state's change and the universe is uncovered their identities may as well. <br/><br/>So, how does that sound? Is there a better way to refer to state changes? Are there any glaring problems with this idea?<br/><br/>   - Mendel Schmiedekamp                </div>
