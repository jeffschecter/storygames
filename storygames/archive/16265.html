We have created a shared universe using Microscope, and now we're running games set in different events/periods from it. This week was an espionage-y event, so we used Ghost/Echo. We played three spy/assassin types who had stolen plans to a space station that is to be built in the Oort Cloud. We escaped to the subterranean oceans of Europa, were arrested, fled custody to Earth, and ended up trying to make our way down a space elevator built in Columbo, Sir Lanka without being spotted. We made stuff up as we went along and it was very free form, but we were unified in liking how the core mechanic worked - the element of choice mixed with randomness was an added dimension to the game.<br/><br/>The GM had the cool idea of saying at the start of play that for our equipment lists, we could use ten syllables to describe what we had. So, for instance, I had:<br/><br/>Camouflage armour (5 syllables)<br/>Knife (1 syllable)<br/>Rail gun (2 syllables)<br/>Chaff bombs (2 syllables)<br/><br/>The rules were good for a one-shot. We didn't take things very seriously and we just went with what seemed appropriate. I would have problems imagining how Ghost/Echo could be used to run a game lasting more than one session, as it was a little bit too light weight, perhaps. It's certainly worth experimenting with.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371249/#Comment_371249" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T15:25:52+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  3:25PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I imagine that you couldd run it episodically like PTA.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371251/#Comment_371251" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T15:30:32+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  3:30PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well yeah, but even then I think the charm would wear thin.
