Here are some of 'em.  I'd like us to list with a small explanation for each but if it needs to get deeper than that please take it to another thread and please do link to that thread from here if ya please.  Also, links to other techniques or AP examples of techniques in action are great.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/><b>Scene Framing</b>: Setting up scenes that flow and not playing the scene before you play.<br/><br/>I.E.  Yes to this:  "In the next scene, you are at the door to the Sorcerer's sanctum and his demon is grinning at you."<br/><br/>And not: "I want to set up my next scene.  I want to jab my dagger down that demon's throat, kick down the sorcerer's door and behead that bastard while screaming my now dead lover's name and trashing his most precious books!"<br/><br/><b>Organizing Friends to Meet:</b>  I honestly didn't realize this was a skill gaming taught me until I had to get people together for my girlfriend's birthday a month or so ago and it was just like gathering people for a game.<br/><br/><b>Pitching Game Ideas that Excite Friends</b>: This is a big ole deal.  Via e-mail or in person, it really is like an elevator pitch.<br/><br/><b>Constructing Situations that make for rich gaming</b>: Examples: you are knights at a tourney all there to swear allegiance to  secret society, orcs caught behind enemy lines in elvish lands, Naval investigators aboard a warship that is circling a top secret island known as Ry'leh, etc.<br/><br/><b>Finding good bangs on a player's character sheet</b>:  Looking at those character sheets and the NPC's the player infers and finding the hand-holds, like rock climbing.<br/><br/><b>Creating good opposition</b>: I think back to my D&amp;D games and how shitty I was at this.<br/><br/><b>Supporting another player by taking a back seat once in a while</b>: We really can give another player a big boost, even by just knowing that they have the trait, BAD-ASS Swordsman and acting a bit in awe of their skill rather than being a flippant jerk.<br/><br/>Also just sitting back at times and letting the conflict that you know is important to a different character play out, while still having a part and adding your bits to the mix is a real balancing act, I think.<br/><br/><b>Being a proactive player</b>: This has become synonymous with engaged and bought-in player to me but I find that this isn't everyone's experience.  This one might become its own thread.  <br/><br/>Others?<br/><br/>A touch more on any of these without any one becoming its own thread?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128500/#Comment_128500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T09:03:49+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Engage with the other folks around the table</b>: Listen to what the other players in a scene are saying, watch what they're doing, and engaged them viscerally on that level.

This leads to my all time favourite gaming anecdote. I was at GenCon UK one year and the late Micheal Sheard was there. You will know him as Hitler in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Admiral Ozzel in ESB, but all Brits of my age know him as Mr Bronson from Grange Hill. Anyway, he perennially got involved in the LARPS that were held and he mentioned to a group of us that he was STUNNED that we could just be given a piece of paper with a few lines, a few numbers and maybe a paragraph of background on it and then, five minutes later, engage in a four hour long, 100 person mass improvised theatre production. He said that he knew actors who had been professionally trained who would baulk at such a challenge and yet we paid money to do it and did it effortlessly.

I've only managed to get a full game together *once* in the last five months or so. (Aside from a handful of character/world generation sessions for an epic Sword &amp; Sorcery campaign that never happened.) Similarly, it's nearly impossible for me to arrange a board gaming get-together outside the established days and hours at various stores around town. Heck, we have trouble getting our weekly improv troupe rehearsals regularly scheduled, and that's only half a dozen committed people. <br/><br/>I know that this has all been discussed before, and we're all responsible adults and so forth, but dang. My gaming needs are not being satisfied, on a purely logistical level, and I'm at a total loss with regards to how to remedy the situation.

I imagine people's lists of specific techniques for emotional management vary a lot, but off the top of my head:<br/> <br/>-<i>Tracking butterflies across your stomach</i>: figuring out what the real underlying problem is, e.g. what sort of stuff you and other players are projecting onto a situation.  Also figuring out how to intensify a fictional situation emotionally. <br/><br/>-<i>Grounding and centering</i>: being able to set aside whatever was nagging you in the previous point, so that you can be energetically present in the moment and speak / listen to whatever is actually going on, not what you're preoccupied with<br/><br/>-<i>The dirty accounting trick</i>: when you feel uncomfortable for reasons that have more to do with your own background than with actual social dynamics, figure out a way to shift that discomfort onto your character so that you can express it in game and poke at it.  <i>Corollary</i>:  if I do something lame during game, it is not because I'm sucking as a player that night.  My character is acting weird because something interesting is going on with her that we just don't know about yet.<br/><br/>-<i>Roleplayers are vaylen</i>: learning how to enjoy consuming your character's negative emotions (yes, this is a learned skill.  it has its own cultural history. and it complements the dirty accounting trick nicely)<br/> <br/>-<i>Emotional labor</i>:  both being reassuring and helping other people troubleshoot their problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130095/#Comment_130095" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T01:17:51+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  1:17AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br/>I'd go a step farther with this.<br/><br/><b>Don't make plans; plan situations</b>:  Make antagonists with goals and a situation that is a boulder on the edge of the cliff and the game begins as the players push the boulder down the mountain.<br/><br/><i>The evil Sorcerer is going to try to get the demon he is in love with to respect him, protect his tower with his minions and thwart the royal wedding</i>is more to it.</blockquote>\nThat's included in what I meant by plans.
