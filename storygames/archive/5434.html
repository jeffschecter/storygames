Though more playtest reports are always useful, I won't be tweaking this particular game much more - but I am thinking of adapting the system to other settings and methods. That means separating the setting-specific bits from the generic bits, and see how they fit with different kinds of scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to summarize the game - It combines a variant of the engine in Until We Sink and the combat rounds in first edition D&amp;D. The setting information is distributed on cards which can be chosen by the GM and players or randomly drawn. There are character backgrounds and player tasks with story privileges ("dream cards"), stage cards with location descriptions and cue cards to base the action on. The game takes place in scenes and rounds, and combines cards to generate a scene. A plot develops between each round, and runs on rails unless the players manage to derail it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player tasks and privileges in particular were designed to explore a specific kind of story, and I'm not sure how to adapt it to different settings. I have been thinking of testing how robust it is by making a scenario set in one of my own fantasy settings (Deephome, if anyone here reads Pyramid). However, that setting completely lacks the kind of pretentious meta-concerns and "exploration of perspectives" stuff I put in "the new middle ages". It's mostly written for the "whoa"'s. Which leaves me with nothing to put on the new equivalent of "dream cards"...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
