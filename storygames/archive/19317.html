Possibly it even did something that was genuinely new. Ever since it's been languishing on my hard drive/a dark corner of the internet waiting, hoping, that one day I would pull my finger from my bum and turn it into a nicely presented game for the edification and enjoyment of all. This is clearly never going to happen.<br/><br/>However, I think it would be a good thing if Great Ork Gods were to be enjoyed by a wider audience and I know it has a few fans out there. Would anyone be interested in taking it on as a project and producing a finished article? Please reply/whisper/otherwise contact me if so.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430199/#Comment_430199" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T17:11:04+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  5:11PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2014 5:11PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Great Ork Gods!

I'm not in position to work on it right now, but I commend your choice of actively looking for help.<br/><br/>One thing you might consider would be to release a public license for folks to do their thing with it, and trust in the marketplace. This is what Paul Czege did with his <i>Acts of Evil</i>, and although I haven't gotten around to it <i>yet</i>, I certainly haven't forgotten about that excellent game either - it shall be finished, sooner or later, thanks to Paul's decision to unilaterally welcome others to work on it at their convenience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430280/#Comment_430280" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-30T12:32:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2014 12:32PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had been thinking about putting it up under a CC-attribution license but I decided to hold off because I figured I'd rather see a single canonical GOG put out than a general free-for-all.
