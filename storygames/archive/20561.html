It's an anthology of 16 roleplaying adventures based on stories by well-known science fiction writers of the 1930s-50s.<br/><br/><a href="http://daytrippersrpg.com/products/golden-age-adventures" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://daytrippersrpg.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/Golden_Age_Cover_Color_web.png"/></a><br/><br/>My approach in this book has been to break down the source stories into what I call "PlotFields" - basically taking an "object-oriented" approach to the construction of settings complete with monsters, obstacles, maguffins and narrative drives - but without forcing any particular arrangement such as a "plot".   (The full text of each source story is also included, so you are free to follow the original plot if you want to, but that's up to you.)<br/><br/>Because these PlotFields are so constructed, they may be used as source material for any type of game that requires alien worlds and narrative components. The DayTrippers system is deliberately simple, and conversion tables are included in the books for other popular game systems. (Not just systems, but whole approaches: the DayTrippers Core Rules book includes a set of "Collaborative Mission" rules which crosses the line between Tradgames and Storygames.)<br/><br/>I'll be using this thread to drop off news and answer any questions anyone might have, and explain some of the techniques I use in the book.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451697/#Comment_451697" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-01T10:30:40+00:00" title="March  1, 2016 10:30AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2016 8:57PM by AsIf.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah.

If you\u2019re a GM, you can make conscious decisions about how to react to the unconscious behaviour of the players; if you\u2019re a player, you can engineer opportunities to redirect play.<br/><br/>The sobriquet \u201cGolden Age\u201d is apposite not only to the origin of the stories on which the scenario-sets are based but to the feeling they engender; they\u2019re kind of old-fashioned but reassuring. I feel it would be possible to \u201cnew wave\u201d them up a bit by mechanizing opportunities for players to make the end-game specifically meaningful to the emotions revealed in play by their characters. (One of the characteristics of SF\u2019s new wave is the swapping of \u201cinner\u201d and \u201couter\u201d space.) A story gamer might have to make some alterations to <i>DayTrippers</i>\u2019 toolkit in order to make this happen, but I like that: you can prep for players you already know well or improvise for those you don\u2019t, or both.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451723/#Comment_451723" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-02T18:09:43+00:00" title="March  2, 2016  6:09PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2016 6:57PM by AsIf.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, you guys!\n<blockquote>What's the difference between a "Plot Field" and a relationship map?</blockquote>A PlotField Diagram is a schematic of a PlotField, and a PlotField is an object-oriented collection of narrative objects (Characters, Locations, Items and Events) which have Relations (shown with arrows) among them.  So effectively Dave is right: it's like a relationship map superimposed on an abstract map of the environment itself, except that it shows relations between various different types of objects (not just characters).<br/>\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>, how many pre-made PlotFields does the book include?  Are they in color?</blockquote>The whole book is in color, and there's a PlotField (as well as a complete object listing) for each story (that is, 16).<br/><br/>The current diagram is the second published design (and the 12th experimental design).  The first was the ill-fated "RunSheet" which (while it looked cool) was pretty useless in play.  I didn't even use it myself.  The current approach I actually <i>do</i> use, I even draw them by hand for custom scenarios.  The whole idea is to provide the GM (or the storygaming group) with a one-page abstraction of the entire PlotField at a glance.  The use of color (in addition to shapes and placement) turned out to be key to compressing all that information.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452206/#Comment_452206" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-14T20:50:46+00:00" title="April 14, 2016  8:50PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2016 10:17PM by AsIf.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine">@Abstract_Machine</a> has written a thought-provoking review of <b><i>Golden Age Adventures</i></b>.  It's actually more of an essay on the nature of shared emergent narrative under different playstyles, and how this may be approached using the book in a game of <i>DayTrippers</i>.  "Storygame" or "Trad"?  Right up the middle?  Season to your own tastes!\ufeff<br/><br/>Here's the <a href="https://akingdomis.wordpress.com/2016/04/14/chemical-wedding/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full monty</a>.<br/><br/>Abstract Machine has the ability to phrase me better than I sometimes phrase myself.  As I've said in other threads, <i>DayTrippers</i> aims to provide a unified mechanic, a flexible character building system, and a <i>toolkit</i> (the GMs Guide) which may be used by any SF group regardless of their style of play.  This may be why I get disgruntled reviews from diehards at the extreme ends of the trad/narr spectrum, and pleasant reviews from curious people who enjoy different approaches to games, somewhere up the middle.<br/><br/>As for the swapping of inner and outer space, this ties into <i>Bleed</i> and <i>Psychic Content</i>.  If this is the sort of experience you're going for (and for me it often is), there are essays in the <i>DayTrippers GameMasters Guide</i> on how to do that more effectively.  It also ties into the rules for <i>Progressive Character Generation</i>, <i>LifeShaping</i>, and <i>Character Development Scenes</i> - all of which have to do with Player input and its (re-)utilization in play.<br/><br/>Here's how I might use GAA for storygame play.  First, everyone who wants to may read the original story (provided in its entirety), and the object listings (and PlotField) will remain available to everyone during play.  We would use the Collab Mission rules from the <i>DayTrippers Core Rules</i> book and choose a GM.  <i>Progressive Character Generation</i> allows us to sketch our characters quickly and develop them as we go, so no bottlenecks there, and the <i>Collaborative Mission Rules</i> help us create a basic PlotField, selecting objects from the listings on the front page of the adventure (each adventure has a listing of obstacles, complications, perks &amp; "maguffins" [sic] which may be used to choose from).  Then for about 15 minutes, the Players would set up their PC sheets and talk about relations while the GM sketch-preps some additional details on the PlotField (but no pre-drawn conclusions), using the Generators in the GMG to randomize/brainstorm as needed.  Again, the object listings are available to everyone, so whenever an Obstacle is encountered (for instance), anyone in the group could select a suitable object from the book (depending on Region and Location) to be that Obstacle, or we could roll one (random encounter tables are provided for every region).  Basically the object listings become the "story bible" from which the group collectively draws - but the format is geographical and object-oriented, not narrative/chronological.<br/><br/>Finally, for groups who like to play with tossing narrative control back and forth a lot, I would recommend running the session as a "Dream World" mission.  This type of mission allows for the PCs to momentarily "take over" aspects of reality (effectively causing "magic" effects to occur at will) based on their <i>Lucid Dreaming</i> skills.  In play, this tends to create surreal gonzo scenes with lots of Psychic Content, as the tendency for everyone (when they gain narrative control) is to do something even weirder than the last person.  Which - this being a Dream World after all - is perfectly fitting.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463751/#Comment_463751" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-07T21:18:33+00:00" title="June  7, 2017  9:18PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The RPG Pundit has written a review of <b>Golden Age Adventures</b> - and he likes it!<br/><a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?36834-RPGPundit-Reviews-Golden-Age-Adventures" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?36834-RPGPundit-Reviews-Golden-Age-Adventures</a><br/><br/>I know a few people here are not terribly enamored of the Pundit, but you gotta admit, pleasing him is a pretty rare thing, and I'm glad to have done it.  :-)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
