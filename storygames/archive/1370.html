                            Really?   I...  I think it's a pretty poor argument against CC.  There is no CC license that removes an author's rights, period, end of story.  All CC licenses simply share some of the author's rights with the audience.  Authors who tend to use CC are also likely to be highly interested and negotiable about sharing or licensing rights--at least as much so as authors who use full copyright.  "License incompatibility" isn't a bug, it's a feature:  CC licenses may only be compatible with the same license, but copyright isn't compatible with <i>anything.</i>  Besides, as mentioned before, CC authors are at least as likely as copyright authors to say "you want to put my Y-licensed stuff in your X-licensed stuff?  Go for it!"<br/><br/>I believe Ben has come out against CC and pro-PD here as well, and I guess that's his thing.  It doesn't stop me from enjoying his work, and he's complimented me on my (CC-licensed) work before as well.  But the simple fact is that CC and GPL/BSD/etc. exist to meet a widespread desire, and it's one the copyright-public domain dichotomy didn't meet.                        </div>

Copyright simply states that a creator has the right to say who can make copies of his/her work, and the conditions under which they can do so.  That's it.  Without that, no licensing scheme can exist, because there is no right to state conditions in order to copy.<br/>

I can see Ben's point in the artistic and game design arenas -- as he points out, copyright does not prevent copying the processes, mechanics, and tone of a game, only copying the text itself; and it does not prevent taking inspiration from someone else's work.<br/>
<br/>
The GPL was designed for a different situation -- namely, computer programs, where rewriting someone else's code to make yours "original" can be difficult and time-consuming, since computer code implements a process, and a "paraphrase" of the code will not implement the exact same process.  Thus, in that case, you're stuck with searching for another process that has the same result, which makes copying the idea from computer code without copying the code more akin to working around a patent.                        </div>

I'm not sure what you mean when you say a "different situation": the GPL only covers copyrighted works in exactly the same way that the CCPL does. It may refer to a Program, but the language of the license is quite clear that this can refer to any kind of work and not just software. I've been quite successful licensing non-software works under the GPL and consider it superior to other free/open content licenses.                        </div>

Maybe this was written in the halcyon days before the MPAA and RIAA and DRM up the wazoo - but nowadays copyright IS a runaway monster.  Everything and anything is propertized and monetized.  You still can't sell a t-shirt with fuckin' Steamboat Willie on it, and the character is almost 100 years old.  Copyright term lengths are getting ridiculously out of hand, and society is getting more litigious.<br><br>Does this apply to the indie scene as it is currently?  Not so much, mainly because I don't think there are any two companies who could raise the capital necessary to sue someone and succeed.  But in the larger context, having licenses like the CC in place are a good thing.<br/><br/>As to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, Ben sets up a couple of strawmen.  I've dealt with quite a few folks who licensed their works under CC-Attrib-NonCommerical, and after going to them and asking for the rights to use it commerically, they said yes without hesitation.  Folks who use CC are rights-conscious, but also rights-liberal, meaning that they tend not to be tight-fisted about commercial use.  In my experience.  And yes - someone can be a dick about commercial rights - but that's no different than copyright.  Furthermore, CC doesn't degrade fair use - your fair use rights stay intact with CC,and you (may) be granted others.  Just because there's a CC license doesn't mean that fair use doesn't apply - the line "Your fair use and other rights are in no way affected by the above." is at the bottom of every CC Deed.<br/><br/>I do agree with Ben on the who GNU/GPL/CC/LPL ... I could go on ... problem.  Some sort of 'bridging clauses' would be helpful so that you could mix projects under different license freely and without too many worries.  <br/><br/>So yeah - not so much.  As it is, I prefer to use CC-Attrib, CC-Attrib-Noncommerical or CC-DevelopingWorld.  CC-Attrib is just 'public domain' in different clothing anyways.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

You still haven't elaborated on these vague "different issues." My point still stands that it's somewhat irrelevant what a license was originally created for but how that license can be used now. At heart, both cover copyrighted works which is what you want from a copyleft license.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>This isn't to say that it's a bad idea to use the GPL for other things...</blockquote>
Actually it's a great idea: not only do you get a tried-and-tested copyleft license but you also have access to the vast pool of GPL (and GPL-compatible) licensed content out there.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>Game mechanics are much easier to rewrite from scratch to do the same thing than most computer programs are.</blockquote>
I think a better analogy would be game mechanics and software algorithmns: both are obvious once you're aware of them and easy to reproduce. OTOH, <i>specific implementations</i> of game mechanics (i.e. game texts) and algorithms (i.e. software code) are non-obvious and difficult to produce (and reproduce exactly).                        </div>

                            Man, I've been bad at getting back to this thread.<br><br/>Brendan, you're right, that link isn't actually the <i>good argument</i> I claimed it to be. But it sparked some interesting thoughts.<br/><br/>Firstly, that point about copyright not applying to games, only to game texts, is always worth making. Sometimes I want a standard, boilerplate post that I can cut-and-paste into copyright discussions: "Just so we're clear, we're talking about game texts here, not games."<br/><br/>Secondly, I liked the idea that such licences discourage communication. It makes sense to me. As an example: when I publish the code for the online engine for Breaking The Ice, I'd like people to use it: but I'd like them to contact me and talk about what they're going to do. <br/><br/>So I liked the general tone of the article: that things should either be public domain (meaning "Use it freely") or just copyrighted (meaning "Ask me first and we'll sort something out").<br/><br/>I tell you what, though: I've realised I started this thread about the wrong subject. What I'm <i>actually</i> thinking about is how I'm going to share the Breaking The Ice code. So I'll start another thread about that.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></div>

Just because there is no requirement to communicate with the orginal author does not mean that license user's won't. What you are talking about is the problem of <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/forking.html" rel="nofollow">forking</a> - a relatively rare occurance in the free software/open source world. In reality people would rather work with other people (if they can) at source.<br/><br/>Rather than force people to ask permission through a non-general license surely it would be simpler to make it clear in your original text that the lines of communication are open (publishing contact details, forums, mailing lists, etc). It seems to me the real problem here is how accessible author's make themselves, not users who want to go it alone.                        </div>

                            What I am curious about is this 'wall' Ben describes.  As far as I can tell, the wall doesn't really exist--it's a social one (i.e. I will think you are a dick if you use my CC material in accord with copyright law but don't use the CC licensing language).  The license itself does not *really* prevent any use associated with copyright--it is more like a pre-emptive grant of permission for certain kinds of use than a full-blown break with copyright.<br/><br/>But perhaps I'll just point to this <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/comics/" rel="nofollow">place</a> as a location where smart, expert types have been hammering out these distinctions for us.<br/><br/>His points about OGL...hmm, makes a lot of sense, although I am assuming most publishers are making this decision for the potential market benefits of association with it.  Sort of informed trade-off.  They may or may not be right about the cost of it, but that seems a quite different question (and a kind of silly one in this context).                        </div>

<p>Huh.  A lot of the reactions here seem to be "nu-uh" so that's a little strange.  I'm trying to decide if it's a failure on my behalf to write my points cogently or just running up against a lifetime of lies and falsehoods about copyrights.  So I'm just going to re-iterate some points, hoping that a new phrasing and some clear examples will make what I'm talking about more apparent.</p>
<p>I'm aware that some people here are very big proponents of virally restrictive liscenses, Creative Commons share-and-share-alike especially, but also GPL, OGL, and whatever else.  Please be aware that I'm going to have some very vitriolic things to say about these licenses, because I think that anything that restricts artistic freedom, especially so violently, is morally wrong.  Uhm... I hope we can handle the conversation civilly, without getting our<em>selves</em> attached to our <em>beliefs</em>.  I do reserve the right to withdraw from the conversation if I get dogpiled or overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I'm also going to talk about law a bunch.  I know a lot about copyright law, but I'm not a lawyer, and if you go to court based on my statements without talking to an IP lawyer that's on your head.</p>
<p>Okay, so I think that there's three points here.</p>
<p>1) The big lie.  Copyright law is not nearly as wide-reaching as you've been lead to believe.  The law as written reserves broad privileges for parody, free use, inspiration, and appropriation of creative content.  Not only that, it's getting better -- there are some orphan works bills right now which will make a great deal of things legal which really ought to be.</p>
<p>(This whole bit is not to talk about the <em>length</em> of copyrights, which have been getting longer and longer.  But the length of copyright is a topic full of right and wrong and emotions and I don't want to get into it right now, because it will certainly derail the thread.)</p>
<p>Now, there is a problem with the law in practice, because of the cost of civil law in the US, but that's a problem with the entireity of US civil law.  Essentially, if you can bluff the other side into think that they're in violation of the law, you can enforce your own law as such, because no one wants to get tangled up in the courts (this is how the RIAA works).  To that end, you have been the victim of a massive dis-information campaign to make you believe that such reasonable things as taking inspiration from a previous work, using small snippets of text or sound, or making copies of tapes for friends are illegal.</p>
<p>Creative Commons, in both development and in practice, plays directly into these myths.  For most uses that CC partisans champion, ordinary fair use is more than sufficient.</p>
<p>As an example of this locally: The Story Games Names Project is a set of lists of names under a creative commons license.  Why?  "so that people can use it."  Well, as it turns out, names are public domain (a fact which helped the development of the book).  So there is no restriction to the use of the contents of the book, by anyone, at all, for any purpose that isn't in itself illegal.  But the license is trying to claim that we don't have ownership over these names -- that we're required to put a little CC stamp and comply in other ways to use them.</p>
<p>(Yes, in theory, you can apply a copyright to the arrangement of the names.  But that's not what the presence of a CC license implies now, does it?  I mean, how many people are going to use the exact layout?)</p>
<p>(I'm not dissing the excellent project.  It was a really cool project and I'm glad it was done.  I'm talking specifically about the fact that it is placed under a legal license that it has a shaky legal claim to and no ethical claim to.  No one owns names.)</p>
<p>Here's a second example.  I remember back in the day when Clinton was stumping for CC, and said "Hey, Vincent, you should put your old unfinished games into CC (otherkind was the one, I think), so someone else can finish them."</p>
<p>There are two key errors here:</p>
<p>The core content (the mechanics and processes) of Otherkind fall under copyright at all.  They don't.</p>
<p>That a potential re-writer would need to fear not getting Vincent's permission.  He wouldn't.  (As a personal example: I appropriate big chunks of otherkind.  After a few months, I said "Oh, Vincent, I use the otherkind dice for Bliss Stage."  And he's like "Sweet!  How?")</p>
<p>continued.</p>

<p>2) Okay, if you agree with the last one (which I somehow doubt, but sport me the bit), you might go "So maybe we don't <em>need</em> Creative Commons, but it doesn't really hurt anything, right?"  And, again, I think that the answer is no.</p>
<p>My concern here is not with the primary creator -- someone who comes up with his totally whole-cloth ideas.  My concern is with secondary and, mostly, tertiary creators.  You know, the people who are actually putting this theoretical resource of ideas to use.</p>
<p>Okay, so let's say that the Alfred writes a game.  He wants to release it under a Creative Commons non-commercial sharealike license.  He uses material from the following artists, all under similar licenses: Betty, Carl, Dan, Emily, Fred, George, Harrieta, Isabel, James, Kevin, and Laura.</p>
<p>Now, let's note that Alfred has now produced a game that he <em>does not own</em> in any real sense.  While he may own the IP in some esoteric legal sense, he can't make the key decisions around the game, such as the decision to use it for commercial purposes, or even the decision to let someone else use bits of it for their own commercial creation.</p>
<p>So, right away, as humongous believer in creator's rights, I'm not cool with this.  But it's fair enough to argue that this is consensual -- he decided he didn't want to use his game for commercial purposes, and got to use a lot of work in the bargain, without the hassle of writing and asking permission.</p>
<p>But let's say that Zeta wants to write a game.  She wants to incorporate elements of Alfred's game, and also Amy's game, Andrew's game, Adrianna's game, and Alison's game.  Let's assume that all these A games are CC non-commercial share-alike, and that all of them have a list of references at least as long as Alfred's.  And let's say that Zeta wants to sell her game.  The A's are all cool with it.  If they could, they would give the same "Cool!  How?" response that Vincent gave.  But they can't, because they're tied by the CC license.  So Zeta needs to contact on the order 50 people, securing their permission to sell her own creative work.  That's fucked.  I would go so far as to say that that's wrong.</p>
<p>This is all because none of the A's actually own their game.  Rather, they can use it under license, a license which necessarily restricts their creative freedom.</p>
<p>(There's an aside here about how viral licenses in software are built precisely to create this sort of paradox, and it's good for code, but crappy for writing.  I'll fill it in if there's interested.)</p>
<p>Let me offer a different model: Complete creator ownership.</p>
<p>Alfred is working on his game, with all his sources.  He contacts the different creators that he wants draw on, and tells them about his project.  "Awesome!" say most of them, go house.  A couple of people want a pay-off to use their stuff (say $50 or whatever) and one guy doesn't like role-playing games and would rather not be involved.  Alfred has now completed his game.  He decides to give it away for free, but he's totally in his rights to sell it or whatever.</p>
<p>Let's say that Zeta is now working on her own game, and she wants to use some bits from Albert's.  "Cool," say Albert, and that's that.  Now Zeta has written her own game, which she owns in its entirity.  If Omega wants to use some for his own game, he doesn't have to ask Albert.  He only has to ask Zeta.</p>
<p>Much easier, yes?</p>
<p>3) So, so far, Creative Commons takes away your rights if you use it (as a secondary or tertiary creator) and it claims to restrict rights it has no legal standing to restrict.  Oh, and it's of no particular benefit to our community, except I suppose as a bit of free press.  As far as I'm concerned, that should be enough to make my case that it's a bad idea.  But, in all honesty, that's not the reason I dislike it (they're reasons I think it's stupid, but that's different.)  I dislike it because the assumptions it brings are socially toxic.</p>
<p>We're artists.  We should be able to freely take inspiration from each other, but we should also be (and are) a community pulsing with creative feedback -- which necessarily runs in both directions, both for the person inspired and the person who inspired.  We should respect each other as people and as artists.</p>
<p>In a situation of mutual respect, all that's required for any manner of appropriation is "Hey, I'm going to use this, cool?"  And the response is almost always "Cool!  How?"  This is totally removed from any legal standing -- I wasn't legally required to talk to Vincent about using Otherkind stuff, but damn, I wanted to!</p>
<p>Creative Commons, and indeed any licensing, assumes a situation where this environment of mutual respect does not exist.  The very basic "right" that it grants is the ability to use the material <em>without telling the original artist about it</em>.  I mean, fuck!  If we get into a place where that's ever an issue, ever, I'm washing my hands of this community as a whole and spitting on its grave.</p>
<p>As it is, every derivative work that has been done based on a CC licensed game (I'm thinking of TSOY here) has been done with the permission and love and respect of the author.  As it should be, of course, but is it apparent that, in that case, there's <em>no reason for the license to exist in the first place</em>?</p>
<p>So, I have a thing, which is basically creator ownership + basic social niceity.</p>

                            That's a solid argument (to me) of why creative commons non-commercial/etc variants can produce more ownership problems than not.<br/><br/>I'm now looking over at the OGL, though, which Fudge is using, and which we've used in SOTC because it's (distantly) Fudge-based.<br/><br/>We didn't use any "product identity" of Fudge, because the OGL compels us to.<br/><br/>In SOTC's OGL specification, we clearly identify what our "product identity" is.<br/><br/>Anyone could pick up SOTC, include the OGL, make sure not to use our identified product identity in their own product, and they'd be golden.<br/><br/>I'm not seeing any of the entanglements you're talking about, here -- no "cloud of 50 people to check with due to interdependencies and such".

<p>Hey, Fred --</p>
<p>The OGL is less of a big deal, because it's not trying to restrict commerce and it allows you to mix OGL and non-OGL material in the same book.</p>
<p>That said, it totally fits into point 1 (it claims copyright on things which are not copyrightable.)  And it still restricts people a bit: if I don't want to have boilerplate licensing in the back of my book, it's difficult for me to use anything from SoC, because you don't have the right to tell me "go to town, it's all yours," since your usage of the material is (in theory -- although I doubt in practice) dependent on Grey Ghost Press's ownership.</p>

As far as I get it, CC is pre-emptive permissions granting.  It says, 'don't worry about asking me about using my work in yours if your work is x or y.'<br/><br/>However, even without CC-licensing, if you are taking an excerpt from a work that took excerpts from other works, you have to go to those original grantors for permission.

Not using CC-licensing does not save you from having to track through all that history yourself.  <br/><br/>If Isabel and Kevin gave Alfred permission (minus CC issues) and you are using material from Alfred which he got from Isabel and Kevin, you still have to go to Isabel and Kevin to get permission.                        </div>

                            I'm not trying to convert you here, Ben--you should absolutely have the right to publish your work however you see fit--but since we're discussing the usefulness of an entire concept, I want to provide a solid counterpoint.  I hope my responding point-by-point won't be considered rude; this is mostly to help me organize my thoughts.<br/><br/>1) The Big Lie:  Ben, I think you kind of talked all the thrust out of this one yourself.<br/><br/>a) "This whole bit is not to talk about the length of copyrights."  But pretending expiration terms don't exist is disingenuous.  Without getting into the issue of whether they're absolutely too long or too short, <i>some authors</i> believe they're too long <i>for their own work.</i>  Creative Commons provides a way for those authors to open their work to redistribution or derivation before the term is up, without forcing them to put it fully (and irretrievably) into the public domain.  I have to squint really hard to see that as anything but a benefit.<br/><br/>b) "There is a problem with the law in practice" and "there are some orphan works bills."  Bills aren't laws, and tort reform has so far been nothing but talk.  I'm an artist working <i>right now</i> and I'd prefer not to wait for the state of US civil law to change--if it changes--before I publish.  Creative Commons sidesteps the whole mess with clarity and ease:  I publish my work under a license, and thereafter you know that I want you to use it in <i>at least</i> one set of ways and won't sue you for doing so.<br/><br/>c) Your SGNP example fails the test you set for it:  since the book will contain considerably more material than just names (non-name lists and art), the aggregate work is copyrightable and a valid subject for a collaborative license.<br/><br/>As for otherkind, you're a poor test subject:  the vast majority of people reading and potentially building on Vincent's works are not people who have slept on his couch.  I know Vincent's not the type of person to sue over abandonware even for non-Ben users, but I've been reading his blog and talking to him on the Forge for years.  If Clinton's (and Vincent's) intention was that a writer who didn't know Vincent or anything about him should be able to pick up the existing text of otherkind, add to it, and republish it, then a CC license would accomplish that.<br/><br/>2) I'm going to respond to your argument about negotiation with a couple diagrams.  Dotted lines are inheritance without negotiation.  Solid lines are inheritance where negotiation is required.<br/><br/>Here's the way it works if all the people except Zeta publish under Attribution-Noncommercial:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/zeta_case_1.png"/><br/><br/>And here's your case for all rights reserved:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/zeta_case_2.png"/><br/><br/>If you count up the solid lines, you'll see that the sum of points of contact is the same; all the Noncommercial restriction has done is move the effort downstream to the person who wants to sell the aggregate, which is exactly what it's supposed to do.  Furthermore, this whole scenario only works as an argument against the Noncommercial clause.  If those upstream licensees published under Attribution or Attribution-Sharealike, the points of negotiation drop to zero; if they published under NoDerivs, it's exactly the same as the full-ownership scenario.<br/><br/>Finally, you make a false distinction between "licensed" and "owned" games.  Making an agreement with an author to reuse their work, whether or not it's under CC, <i>is called licensing</i>--unless Alfred bought the actual copyrights to Betty's and Carl's work, which you say is unethical.  In both examples you presented, Alfred's game is a licensed creation (presumably in conjunction with some original material that he owns outright).<br/><br/>3)  This is where it becomes obvious that dodging the issue of copyright expiration is impossible.  A community of mutual respect and communication among creators can only exist in a situation where the creators themselves are perpetually present and communicable.  But we're not always instantly available, and we're hardly immortal.  If I have an aneurysm tomorrow, I don't want potential collaborators for the next eighty-five years to have to track down my next of kin and secure her permission to use my stories--I want a license slapped on the front that says they're free to do so right now.  CC accomplishes that nicely.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ricardo</cite><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>I mean just what I said.  The GPL can be applied to other things, and is useful for it, but it was originally created for use with software, which has different issues than games do.</blockquote>
You still haven't elaborated on these vague "different issues." My point still stands that it's somewhat irrelevant what a license was originally created for but how that license can be used now. At heart, both cover copyrighted works which is what you want from a copyleft license.<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: Ricardo</cite><blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>This isn't to say that it's a bad idea to use the GPL for other things...</blockquote>
Actually it's a great idea: not only do you get a tried-and-tested copyleft license but you also have access to the vast pool of GPL (and GPL-compatible) licensed content out there.<br/><br/>A specifically "different issue" is that the GPL treats in depth linking against libraries and how the license carries in those cases.  I don't remember having to link against other people's games.  There's definitely the idea in some of the modular and generic systems of a sort of software library approach to design, but linking was never really an issue.<br/><br/>Another is that one of the big philosophical requirements of the GPL is that you must distribute source code along with an executable.  That was the whole point in the first place.  I don't remember ever compiling a game of mine (unless you consider generating PDFs from markup.  And who really wants the original markup of a book?)  In fact, a naive author who GPL'd their game might be in immediate violation if they weren't willing to distribute their working documents to anyone who'd bought a copy of their book.<br/><br/>And, "tried-and-tested" doesn't really apply to almost any copyleft license.  There have been limited tests of the GPL to my knowledge, and that's about it.  The real goblin of the whole Open Anything movement is the thought that the various licenses may not be enforceable.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ricardo</cite><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>Game mechanics are much easier to rewrite from scratch to do the same thing than most computer programs are.</blockquote>
I think a better analogy would be game mechanics and software algorithmns: both are obvious once you're aware of them and easy to reproduce. OTOH,<i>specific implementations</i>of game mechanics (i.e. game texts) and algorithms (i.e. software code) are non-obvious and difficult to produce (and reproduce exactly).
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Now, there is a problem with the law in practice, because of the cost of civil law in the US, but that's a problem with the entireity of US civil law.  Essentially, if you can bluff the other side into think that they're in violation of the law, you can enforce your own law as such, because no one wants to get tangled up in the courts (this is how the RIAA works).</blockquote>
These two quotes together: the grey area is between "inspired by" and "derivative works."  Powerful lobby groups are pushing for more and more cases to be recognized as derivative, and courts are agreeing with them.  That's like bluffing a high pair with 15 cards on a huge pot.  Yes, copyright law, and the Library of Congress material all say "you can copyright game text, but not the rules," but I'd love to see how far that goes if Hasbro ever decides it's worth suing a heartbreaker for producing a derivative work of D&amp;D.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Well, as it turns out, names are public domain (a fact which helped the development of the book).  So there is no restriction to the use of the contents of the book, by anyone, at all, for any purpose that isn't in itself illegal.  But the license is trying to claim that we don't have ownership over these names -- that we're required to put a little CC stamp and comply in other ways to use them.</blockquote>
Names are certainly public domain.  And here I want to specifically back you up: the Library of Congress does make it clear that a list of public domain items can itself not copyrighted.  The format of those names can be copyrighted, though.  That includes little tables to roll d20 against, and that can be claimed.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Okay, so let's say that the Alfred writes a game.  He wants to release it under a Creative Commons non-commercial sharealike license.  He uses material from the following artists, all under similar licenses: Betty, Carl, Dan, Emily, Fred, George, Harrieta, Isabel, James, Kevin, and Laura.Now, let's note that Alfred has now produced a game that he <em>does not own</em> in any real sense.  While he may own the IP in some esoteric legal sense, he can't make the key decisions around the game, such as the decision to use it for commercial purposes, or even the decision to let someone else use bits of it for their own commercial creation.</blockquote>
There's nothing stopping Alfred approaching those artists and getting them to grant him a separate license, any more than there was if they all held all rights reserved on their works.  Alfred even has the added bonus that he can collect them, and distribute them under certain conditions, without having to seek the original creators and their blessings.  He can get a lot farther in the project before he has to ask permission.<br/><br/>And if Alfred does collect these works, and gets license to use them under a different license, and so has the creative control to do whatever he wants with it, and I buy a copy, and see Carl and Emily's work and want to use them in my game, can do that without seeking their permission, because they're still CC.<br/><br/>The only freedom I give up by releasing a work under a CC deed is that I cannot take it back.  I enter a binding agreement with the world that they can use my work in the way I've specified and I can't do anything about it.  If they want more, they can come to me on a case by case basis.                        </div>

<p>Dudes: It couldn't be more simple.</p>
<p>If I give someone the nod to use my stuff (like: Can I use the specific Polaris Key Phrases for this game I'm making about hobos?) I have given them the permission to use it to make something that they own, and can make any decisions about, including the decision to let someone else use parts of it, without me.</p>
<p>If I let someone use my stuff if and only if they will apply a viral license, I'm letting them use it with a restriction that prevents them from just "giving the nod" to other people, because they don't own what they produced.  The only own it inasmuch as my license doesn't restrict them, and it does restrict them insofar as permitting unlicensed derivatives.  If a third party wants to use their stuff unlicensed, it's legally not enough for them to go through that person, they must also go through me.</p>
<p>Thus, use of CC material takes away vital rights and, furthermore, prevents other authors who use CC material from granting you those rights.  It gummies up the act of artistic exchange.</p>
<p>This is the difference between a non-viral, non-restrictive license, and a viral, restrictive license.</p>
<p>yrs--<br/>
--Ben</p>
<p>P.S.  There has been one court case about RPGs, ever.  I believe it was settled against TSR, who was trying to claim that D&amp;D gave them broad copyright over all RPGs as derivative works.</p>
<p>P.P.S.  Likewise, there's this assumption amongst the proponents of viral restrictive licensing that "the courts" are on the side of the companies.  Most of these cases are settled out-of-court, and I'm not familiar with any land-mark cases breaking for the media holdings companies, rather than against them.</p>

You make it sound like a problem: clearly this does not apply to non-software works so you simply ignore it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Another is that one of the big philosophical requirements of the GPL is that you must distribute source code along with an executable.</blockquote>
Again, there is a large amount of literature about applying the GPL to non-software works. In this case, it's easy to consider that a game "object code" could refer to the PDF, and "source code" to the original Scribus/Pagemaker or word processor files used to produce your work. There is no "big philosophical"(?) requirement here, just a trivial obstacle.<br/><br/>As I've said, I and others have applied GPL and other licenses with source requirements to our non-software works without any of the problems you mention.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>In fact, a naive author who GPL'd their game might be in immediate violation if they weren't willing to distribute their working documents to anyone who'd bought a copy of their book.</blockquote>
This sounds like FUD to me: any "naive author" who uses a license without reading it carefully first, whether that be the CCPL (with it's technical measures clauses) or the GPL, could be in violation. You're no more at risk of this with the GPL, than you are with the CCPL.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>And, "tried-and-tested" doesn't really apply to almost any copyleft license.  There have been limited tests of the GPL to my knowledge, and that's about it.</blockquote>
While the GPL has been in tested in various courts - more than any other copyleft license - and it has been continuouly tested by the legal compliance division of the FSF out of court. Ergo, tried-and-tested. Of all such licenses it is the first and oldest. Unlike some other licenses, the GPL changes rarely and so is widely understand by both legal and non-legal minds across the globe.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>The real goblin of the whole Open Anything movement is the thought that the various licenses may not be enforceable.</blockquote>
Yet again, FUD: these licenses are most certainly enforceable and I would be very wary about giving legal advice to the contrary to any "naive authors" who might be reading this list. I can see the reasoning about why some people might choose not to use copyleft licenses, but I do not understand why people feel the need to take part in the Big Lie and actively try to disuade others as well.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Yes, copyright law, and the Library of Congress material all say "you can copyright game text, but not the rules," but I'd love to see how far that goes if Hasbro ever decides it's worth suing a heartbreaker for producing a derivative work of D&amp;D.</blockquote>
More FUD: AFAIK, in all the time they have existed, TSR/WotC have never attempted to sue a heartbreaker for producing a "derivative" of D&amp;D.                        </div>

Dude, is it every simple? Should anyone pretend it is?

These licenses never claim to allow users to use a work without restriction. Neither are they viral: you either choose to work with them or not, nothing about them requires you to use them if you don't want to. Yet more FUD.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>The only own it inasmuch as my license doesn't restrict them, and it does restrict them insofar as permitting unlicensed derivatives.</blockquote>
It clearly restricts them by requiring them to ask your permission first, something a general free/open content does not require. The restriction also becomes a problem for a licensee if you change your mind, become unavailable, etc.                        </div>

                            Thanks. This is exactly the discussion I wanted.<br/><br/>On the issue of asking permissions, may I check something? Let's say I'm writing a game, and I want to use some of the text from Polaris. I contact Ben, Ben gives permission and so my text goes:
<blockquote>"Graham's Game About Squirrels" is a roleplaying game for 2-4 people. As you play GGAS, bear in mind the following, from Ben Lehman's game Polaris:
<blockquote>Blah blah text from Polaris</blockquote>
You will find this is very useful as you play.<br/></blockquote>
If Judson now wants to quote from "Graham's Game About Squirrels", and include the Polaris text, does he need to contact me? Or both me and Ben? Ben's reply, above, suggests that they just need to contact me: does this depend on exactly what type of permission Ben gave me?<br/><br/>(Of course, even as I'm writing this, I can see what an unlikely case it is. Since only the text is copyrightable, not the game, it's extremely unlikely that anyone would want to republish a chunk of text which itself republished someone else's text. But it's the case that's been discussed above and you can see it being relevant with, say, reusing images).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

It's your 'if and only if' here.  You're setting a requirement that CC doesn't actually require.  In the text of the license, it says that any of the restrictions of the license (including requiring that the user also use a CC or similar license for their work) can be waived through contact with the original licensor.  <br/><br/>You're setting a restriction on the use of the licensed material which doesn't have anything to do with the license - only the licensor's use of it - and then blaming the result on the license.  If the licensor isn't an originating licensor, then yes - the new author goes back to any originating licensors and determines their license status, if any.  For example, let's say you want to do a derivative work from a CC'd d20 product.  You have to follow the CC terms for anything you use that's IP from the CC book, and follow the OGL if you use anything from the SRD, and the d20 STL if you're using the logo.  <br/><br/>You could simplify your life by omitting anything from the SRD, but there you have it.  Comply with the CC license terms (NonCommerical, Attrib, whatever) for your work (or get dispensation), include the OGL if you're using SRD material and denote Open Content, and follow the d20 STL if you're going to slap a d20 logo on your cover. <br/><br/>Yes, if you DON'T get dispensation from the d20 producer, you have to follow up by CCing your own work, but that's only if you have more than fair use amounts of content in your own work - a state of affairs which is no different than copyright.  
<blockquote>If a third party wants to use their stuff unlicensed, it's legally not enough for them to go through that person, they must also go through me.<p>Thus, use of CC material takes away vital rights and, furthermore, prevents other authors who use CC material from granting you those rights.  It gummies up the act of artistic exchange.</p></blockquote>
No, they don't have to go through you, because you've already passed the rights 'downstream' as it were.  They only have to go through you if they want to alter the terms of the license, and want to use more than fair use amounts of your material.<br/><br/>And if someone is creating a ... what ... third generation derivative work, I'd say that the process is gummy enough already.
<blockquote><p>P.S.  There has been one court case about RPGs, ever.  I believe it was settled against TSR, who was trying to claim that D&amp;D gave them broad copyright over all RPGs as derivative works.</p></blockquote>
There was a boardgame case where the precedent was set that game mechanics were not protected by copyright, being a form of formulae.<br/><br/>And there have been other RPG cases: Palladium v. Everyone in making conversion notes to and from their products.  WotC was hit with it.  I have the silver sticker on the back of my Primal Order book to prove it.  :^)
<blockquote><p>P.P.S.  Likewise, there's this assumption amongst the proponents of viral restrictive licensing that "the courts" are on the side of the companies.  Most of these cases are settled out-of-court, and I'm not familiar with any land-mark cases breaking for the media holdings companies, rather than against them.</p></blockquote>
'Settled out of court' = 'Made the little guy pay through the nose to avoid a protracted legal grind and paying thousands in legal fees'.  The courts are <i>de facto</i> on the side of the guys with the deep pockets.                        </div>

It does.  And with Ben's CC license in the original book (or lack thereof), you know what sort of permissions were given to use that material.  If it's only a short passage, you don't need any kind of license whatsoever *anyways* - since fair use with attribution is always the default.

If folks want to make CC licensing into some bugbear by coming up with the 99.9th percentile case, I can rest easy at night knowing it's only people who've put themselves in that situation on purpose that are suffering.  If someone can't make their 3rd-generation derivative work without a lot of extra legwork, it's their own damn fault.  Write something original instead.                        </div>

A couple of people have said this.  I don't think you realize the implications.  Have I passed the rights downstream, or not?<br/><br/>If I haven't, then you have to go get permission from all owners of anything that was ever derived from, as I described.

*YOU* have broken the TSoY license, in that case.  TSoY is under a "Creative Commons Attribution-<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">NonCommercial</span>-ShareAlike 2.5 License."  You've either licensed it as CC Attrib-SA, which means that the person below you on the food chain must do the same, or you've gotten dispensation from Clinton to make your maximally-derivative work sans the license (<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unfreakin'likely</span>).<br/><br/>So have you gotten permission or not?  If you have, then you've already agreed to make it ShareAlike with Clinton and can't allow your friend to close TSoY.  You'd be in violation of your terms with Clinton (unless you went back and got them changed - <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">again, unfreakin' likely</span>).  <br/><br/>If you haven't gotten permission, then you're a naughty leprechaun and deserve to be spanked with a cricket bat.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>If Judson now wants to quote from "Graham's Game About Squirrels", and include the Polaris text, does he need to contact me? Or both me and Ben? Ben's reply, above, suggests that they just need to contact me: does this depend on exactly what type of permission Ben gave me?<br/></blockquote>
It depends a lot on how much text it is (assume it's an entire chapter of mechanics), and the permission Ben gave you.  Ben might have given you explicit permission to do whatever you want with his text, in which case you could grant permission on to me.  If I were in Ben's shoes, I'd give you permission to use the text in your game, and implicit retain all other rights, including and especially rights of transfer.  In which case I (as Judson again) would have to ask Ben directly if I wanted to use his Polaris text.                        </div>

                            Probably, too, unless Graham has some pretty explicit contract language from Ben regarding the 'do whatever you want with it,' you will probably want to check with Ben anyhow.  Otherwise you risk getting into that unpleasant situation where Ben only intended that 'do anything you want' to apply to Graham (i.e., you, Graham, are free to use this bit from Polaris in anything <i>you</i> do) and then sees it show up in Judson's game (i.e. wtf--who said he could use Polaris like that?).  Everyone in this picture means well, but in the the end result everyone has some hurt feelings.                        </div>

Sorry, Clinton.

While I do believe every word I wrote, my tone was really unnecessarily combative and vitriolic, and that has helped this discussion not at all.<br/><br/>Discussing IP rights between artists is like discussing religion and politics -- the situation is very complicated, simple viewpoints are almost never right, and it's very easy to get emotionally worked up and fail at empathizing with those that hold differing beliefs.  I'm sorry that my tone and arguments did not foster a positive atmosphere for a sensitive discussion.</blockquote>
Oh man - I was just getting warmed up!  Feel free to whisper anything additional to me.  I certainly was enjoying what we had going on, and I think that these sorts of debates are critical to what we do.  I don't think that licenses should be undertaken lightly, and debates like this are a good way to help folks sort out their own feelings.
<blockquote>I'm going to bow out of the thread now.  If people who are fond of sharealike licenses would like to give arguments (like my original) or rebuttals, I will gladly be reading them, but I won't respond.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben</blockquote>

                            Just two bits:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> It goes sometimes unnoticed, but I find that one of the most useful properties of the CC licenses is that they allow (and encourage) the re-distribution of your work.<br/><br/>With a CC-By-NC, for example, I can print some pages of your game for a convention, mirror your PDF in a webpage, translate your game to my own language and post it in a forum, etc...<br/><br/>Using a CC license not only simplifies A LOT the act of creating a hack of your game, it also simplifies A LOT the act of distributing your game AS IT IS.<br/><br/>And I know that you can always post your game in your own website for free but sites go down, games get lost and I'm so tired of going to the Wayback Machine to look for old stuff that I just wish that all games that were freely offered by their creators in their own webpages could have been mirrored by fans so they will be available nowadays.<br/><br/>For example: I cannot mirror GURPS-Lite even if the rules are free for everyone to grab. This makes GURPS-Lite less popular than it will be if they just used the most restrictive CC license (say CC-By-NC-ND) which is pretty much the same deal but without free re-distribution of their unmodified document (where they can put their name, website, etc...).<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Licensing a PDF by parts (<i>images are Copyrighted, but text is CC-By-SA except the basic rules that are OGL...</i>) is a nightmare and goes against the spirit of free licenses.<br/><br/>If you cannot license the whole thing using a single type of license it is better to create a "lite" version (without images or without setting or just with the basic rules or...) that others can use without surgery. Or at least license whole pages of your document, so we can print or re-distribute them without editing it (<i>from page XX to page YY the content is CC-By, the rest of the document is All Right Reserved</i>).<br/><br/>This is perfectly compatible with dual licensing (<i>this game is CC-By and OGL</i>) and with the idea of wanting to get paid for the "complete" version, I just want to point that sometimes I would rather see fewer parts of a PDF getting a free license if that means that the free parts are easier to use, share and remix.<br/><br/>For example: The fact that Fate text is CC is offset by the fact that I cannot share the Fate PDFs because the illustrations are copyrighted. I know that there is a SRD freely available and that I can share it, but, again, I wonder if it wouldn't be more productive in marketing terms to publish a completely CC version of the FAE PDF.<br/><br/>And I'm fully conscious that it is really generous to get a nicely illustrated PDF for free and that the companies that publish games are not charities but, again, simplicity trumps everything else in terms of spontaneous and genuine word-of-mouth.                        </div>

                            Yes, since this thread has already been resurrected I can add a link to the new thread. But generally, I don't know of a way to add links from old threads to new threads <i>without also resurrecting</i> the old threads. Do you? That would be great… <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> <br/><br/>Also, while I admitted my mistake earlier, I want to also explicitly say this: Jason, I apologize for this. I love thread resurrection, typically, but you're right that when the thread is political, it's not appropriate. I was selfish. Lesson learned.<br/><br/>Edit: the long edit windows on S-G posts is part of the appeal of S-G. I guess I kinda see S-G as the best "wiki" around.                         </div>

                            I can't speak for Jason, but I think that adding a new post with a link to an old thread should not ruffle any feathers.<br/><br/>We just don't want to create the illusion that ten-year-old opinions are still current (by, say, offering counter-arguments). In a sensitive topic such as this one, a new thread (with links going either way) seems like a great idea.                        </div>

                            If we're voting on this (and why not, it's not like the admin won't benefit from hearing from us), then I dislike disassociated thread resurrection, which it definitely counts as if it's a thread about a non-ongoing issue, resurrected by someone who was not party to the original discussion. I do not mind slow-moving discussions, and find explicit time limits stupid (there's no number of days that makes a thread "old"), but actual necromancy is little different from (figurative) dancing on graves.<br/><br/>(That interestingly goes for actual actual necromancy, too, if it were a thing: terribly disrespectful of the dead, and the memories of the living. Don't do it.)<br/><br/>And yeah, selective resurrection effectively advertises old opinions, as Paul notes. The spirit of the new-fangled right to privacy (as apparently being established here in Europe) isn't really served by forums that allow anybody to riffle through the archives and pick out the most embarrassing brain-farts for another go at the top spot of the forum. The disassociation with their own old stuff is often difficult enough for people without having others bring them prominently out of the archives for no good reason.<br/><br/>A post with a link to the new thread is probably the best choice, although even then I would personally prefer it if the forum software had a way to ignore such managerial posts in thread dating - as it is, old threads are dragged up by the user interface and presented out of chronological order when new posts are made.<br/><br/>What forum software actually needs is support for blog-like linkbacks: whenever somebody (on-forum or off, using the protocol) links to a thread, there's no particular reason why forum software couldn't do like blogs and insert the linkback into the thread, all without considering it a "real post". A blog and a forum are rather similar things, there really isn't much reason for the latter not to adopt the innovations of the former.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I feel like the "how can we update old posts so that they reference new posts is largely to not do it": I enjoy the visions for how people might better solve the problem of "how do we gather a lot of wisdom about one topic", but I will make two suggestions:<br/><br/>1) maybe you can create a new thread with ideas on how to compile interesting discussions on a given topic (I think this is a good thread idea!)<br/>2) my guess is that the right solution involves broadening the horizon to "wouldn't it be cool if people made a collection of blogpost/medium articles as meta-threads for cool topic across the entire rpg discussion space"<br/><br/>But, all of that should go in a new thread! As of now. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'll leave this open, but I kinda expect this to be the last post, and that this thread be allowed to return to its slumber.<br/><br/>EDIT: crossposted with Jason. I'm just going to close this. Start a new thread, and we'll edit in a link here.                        </div>
