It curbs most problems already. Remove identity and I think you'll see more asshattery, not less, even if the moderators can see a person's identity. <br/><br/>People could still sign their posts, and I suspect they would do so to circumvent the "enforced" anonymity.<br/><br/>People would post ideas without any accountability. If they stay within the safe harbor of the rules of the forum, they can say any damned thing they want without fear of social repercussions. You seem to think this is a good thing, but I think it's awful. <br/><br/>Ownership of ideas is important. Not just to prevent asshattery, but to provide context for understanding those ideas. If you say X, I know that you also said Y and Z before. It helps me understand what you mean.<br/><br/>Anonymity creates a barrier to friendship. Friendship glues communities together. <br/><br/>Your idea creates a forum of ideas disconnected from people, which is like some kind of autistic dream but it doesn't work well when you're trying to, you know, create a community of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261228/#Comment_261228" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T10:57:02+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 10:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Thoughts?</blockquote>\nWhat you describe is this:<br/><a href="http://boards.4chan.org/tg/" rel="nofollow">http://boards.4chan.org/tg/</a><br/><br/>Note that at the moment I posted the above link, the word "fag" appears five times on the front page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261234/#Comment_261234" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:10:24+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:10AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>/tg/ would be a great board if it wasn't splintered from general 4chan culture.</p>\n<p>As it is the people are lowest common denominator assholes that can't get along.</p>\n<p>Forced anonymity is pretty good in general though just because it lets people evaluate the content of a post rather than the reputation of the poster.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261236/#Comment_261236" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:19:14+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:19AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, start it and see what happens.

Lots of forums have worked to varying degrees with lots of ways, anyone saying that your forum will cease to function entirely is pulling pseudo academic shit out their ass without any particular cause.<br/><br/>That's why I post threads like the Stop speaking stuckupstorygameese threads, if that whole social currancy thing worked, I wouldn't because the first responces i got where whispers going 'not kewl man' and that 'rude' man. Each forum will probably take on a 'culture' (im using that term loosely here) of its own, much like a coorporation or a workspace does. I think the problem is when this culture becomes at ends with the so called purpose of a forum, and theirs nothing about anomity that impeeds talking/posting.  I'm kinda glad I posted that thread, because even though I haven't posted in it (I dont particularly want the story games gang bang kthx) its still going, and I see all these strange usernames under it, it makes me happy. <br/><br/>I think story games as a whole could use a whole lot less armchair sociologists/Psycologists if this thread is any indication, it just makes me roll my eyes sometimes what the fucking equivelent of believing in demons and that witches don't float but from the mouths of the armchair 'scientists' here gets a lot of credit. But hey I'm probably part of the problem (not being of the original dispora from the forge or whatnot) with my craziness, like saying what i believe without fear of prosecution, and talking about games however i damn well feel like. <br/><br/>Sometimes its fun to be the problem<br/><br/>~Anon<br/>~Ps I really recommend that you actually go and post on /tg/ @ 4chan rather than talking about it, because really the experience vs the "internet hate machine" is a little different. I personally find 4chan more friendly, welcoming, and more helpful in the discussion of games, than this place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261267/#Comment_261267" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:57:53+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really liked the anonymity of the Little Game Chef that Graham and others ran some time ago.

Suppose a pure exchange of ideas is the goal? Are you suggesting that it is impossible to participate in debate and idea exchange with strangers/non-friends?</blockquote>\nI don't believe there is such a thing as a "pure exchange of ideas," because ideas come from people. To get any kind of traction on the site -- that is, to get people to use it regularly -- you need to build a community. I don't know why you put "community" in scare quotes. I'm not using it in any weird sense of the word. I just mean a group of users who keep posting to this theoretical site. Without users, it's just a piece of software that no one uses. You'll be solving all these social problems you think exist, which are by and large community issues, but you won't have a community to test them on.<br/><br/>Or you will attract users who fear accountability. I'm not sure that's better. If you're constructing software for Iranians to use to discuss overthrowing their government, hey, awesome. They do need anonymity (but removing their names from the posts isn't gonna be enough to protect them, just to get that out of the way). I don't believe that people need that kind of anonymity to discuss, say, story games, or that the need for anonymity outweighs the community's need for accountability.\n<blockquote>Suppose "moderators as policemen" is part of the goal? Suppose a TRULY safe posting environment is the goal? In the sense that "this is a forum for ideas and discussion, not abuse or identity politics;" and that's enforced with post deletion, banning, etc? Modern forum tools make moderating very simple. And the "real world" has all sorts of "policemen" involved in debate or idea exchange, especially where the ideas are more important than those who convey them (novel notion, I know!).</blockquote>\nReally, the sarcasm is unnecessary. I totally understand your goal here. I just don't think your implementation will work. I have about fifteen years of experience in online community building and I've been very successful at it. Moderated communities, too. It's hard enough to get people to behave under normal circumstances. <br/><br/>Truly safe from what? From criticism? People can still criticize what you write. From attribution? I suppose, but except in certain dire political situations (viz Iran), where is attribution really harmful when you have a pseudonym (not using your real name)? There are two main dangers to posting your ideas online under a pseudonym: 1. people will treat the idea badly, and 2. you can get a bad reputation. Your implementation does not provide a safe harbor for people treating the idea badly. It only removes reputation from the system and this assumes that people won't figure out who people are based on their ideas and writing styles, which is a huge leap anyway. I guess what I'm saying is, exactly how dangerous do you think posting online using a mostly anonymous, but attributable pseudonym really is, anyway?<br/><br/>Modern tools do not make moderation simple because the moderators still need to read every line of text. And then you have a certain class of user who has more power than other users, and bam! identity politics. Another way to put this: Policing requires community standards, and you're trying to get rid of the community.<br/>\n<blockquote>Accountability is handled simply, through right to access. Presuming access is desirable, why<span style="color: #ff0000;">wouldn't</span>the threat of a ban prevent poor behavior? Remember that the person is NOT anonymous entirely, just when posting.<span style="color: #ff0000;">[edit]</span></blockquote>\nI remember just fine. In my experience, abusers can get around banning pretty easily. TOR and other mechanisms can make internet users truly (or practically) anonymous to the moderators. You've designed a mechanism that is attractive to abusers and less attractive to people who play by the "rules" (i.e., the community standards, and they would earn social credit for doing so). How do you keep these abusers away when you can't actually identify them? It's a problem every web forum has, sure, but yours would be especially attractive to griefers.\n<blockquote>(Signing a post to bypass the forum policy would be a deletion offense, of course--straw man.)</blockquote>\nYes, but I could just make sure that I talk about my kid Ryan in every post, or the fact that I live in Cleveland, or use the word "contumelious" a lot. I would love for you to create your site and run it, just to see how cleverly people circumvented the "no signatures" policy. <br/><br/>Human beings have social currency for good reasons. It's a hundred thousand years of genetic programming and it's made us very successful as a species. Forum software that goes against that grain is certainly interesting as an experiment but, I believe, ultimately doomed to failure. Our programming is very strong and people will find ways around the blockades preventing the things that we do every day in every other community to which we belong. Good social forum software embraces human behavior and uses its strengths rather than fighting against them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261277/#Comment_261277" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T12:15:02+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 12:15PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tupla, could you ellaborate?

I certainly didn't mean it to be revolting. I meant it at face value. And maybe this software would be great for people who aren't readily equipped to deal with people in normal social situations.

Removing identity does not remove community; it merely creates a community of anonymous users. If you don't create a community -- which is a possibility due to alienation the software could create -- then you won't have people using the software.

People may or may not believe me.<br/><br/>Or I respond later on in my own thread, and people say that I'm not actually the original poster. <br/><br/>I guess my point is that a "discussion" or "conversation" between two people goes A --&gt; B --&gt; A --&gt; B etc. It does not go [idea] --&gt; [idea] --&gt; [idea] --&gt; [idea], though I've said it'd be an interesting experiment to see what happens, in any case.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>really, I get you dont like it, but hey, there are reasons to like it, any drawbacks to anonomous forums seem pretty inherant to all forums.

My apologies.<br/><br/>Yes, I am very mildly autistic (it used to be called Asperger, and mine is a mild form of even that mild autism). It mainly shows up in how I miss some social cues and in an overly analytical approach to things others treat as trivial (no surprise for anyone, there, I'm sure).<br/><br/>But no need to argue about arguing, as you say. To reply directly:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>What do you think I said that begs the question?  Can you be way more specific?</blockquote>\nI may be using the wrong term, but here's the first:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Your idea puts the moderators into the position of policemen.</blockquote>That presumes that NOT putting them there was a goal for the idea. At no time did I state that in the OP. SO maybe not a strict begging of the question, but forcing me to answer an objection about a premise I never made (and, further, to which I don't object--moderation is under-used, I feel). And then:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>People would post ideas without any accountability. If they stay within the safe harbor of the rules of the forum, they can say any damned thing they want without fear of social repercussions. You seem to think this is a good thing, but I think it's awful.</blockquote>And that implies that "within the safe harbor," folks would be asshats. That, I'm pretty sure, is begging the question (though I didn't outright say that Moderators would stop asshattery, I should think that it was implied by the fact that they could see poster IDs when other couldn't; there's no need for that, if they don't DO anything about it). Finally:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Anonymity creates a barrier to friendship. Friendship glues communities together.</blockquote>This is presuming community is the goal (I put it in quotes because I was quoting you--I didn't use that word; and I'd use a single quote if I was coining a term or repurposing it).<br/><br/>At any rate--again, I'm sorry if I reinforced your notions of me, yet again. I did not want to defend this idea so much as discuss it. I appreciate your experience and input, even as I think that your experience is with a 'different beast' than what I'm aiming at or thinking about. On that note:<br/><br/>What makes those of you who say ideas can't be exchanged without identity? I understand context; but I also know that someone can easily link to past, reinfocing posts if they must establish context to save posting time. What I don't quite follow is, for example, why "design advice" needs to be contextualized, in particular when it's demonstrable? Save a bit of time, maybe (i.e. you don't have to try out someone's idea if you 'know' that they are clueless design newbs)? I mean... what happened to just TRYING it out? An inspired amateur might have a FAR better idea for a particular layout challenge than even a seasoned pro--it's not common, but it could happen (and those of you insisting upon pre-qualification would never even see it!). And even if it's not to your taste, at least you SAW it and gave it equal time.<br/><br/>I think there's something to unpack, there, about identity politics, but ONLY in terms of expertise (again, if the goal is unfettered exchange of quality ideas). Yes, experts can give better advice than amateurs. But I guess I'd argue/redirect by asking, "OK, that works for, say, graphic arts. But how many 'expert game designers' do we really have; and is game design such a science now that one must 'study up' to qualify for having an opinion?" I'd be inclined to answer no, just by the sheer number of wild-ass ideas come out of new posters here and at the Forge on almost a weekly basis.<br/><br/>Annnnd... I'm TLDR, I bet. (TLDR would go away, too--nothing to convince someone to read a wall of text other than GRABBING them with a good opener and maintaining high quality, dense communications throughout.)<br/><br/>[Aside: quoting works fine without identity, assuming the PHP can be tweaked right--it would link back to the post number, as always, but just not show the poster ID.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261296/#Comment_261296" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T12:55:22+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 12:55PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Adam,</p>\n<p>You're talking without real experience in this kind of social framework.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Say I start a thread about some new idea I have for chat software.

While this makes for an ... "excentric" community, it also means the "Hmmm, is this really a good idea" barrier is much lower, so there's a whole load of bullshit there. Horrible, horrible bullshit. "The Abyss" style bullshit. But as 4chan plunges into the depths of human creativity, it also goes towards the other extreme, producing some of the most awesome stuff on the internet.\xb4, whether its weird pics involving cats or the genius that is 4chans 40k. (Thousand monkey, thousand typewriters kinda thing.)<br/><br/>Another thing this lack of accountability engenders is lack of respect. Lack of respect towards each other and the rest of humanity in parts, which makes it a rough ride, but also lack of respect towards simple stuff like canon, established settings and so on. As with a lot of things in life, respect is a double edged sword. It's great to have, but it can also be another barrier.<br/><br/>All in all, I doubt that 4chan could be the creative, free-for-all orgy/massacre it is without the default anonymity. And the world would be a more boring place without 4chan.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not sure the theoretical forum established here would actually work. For one, I agree with other people that moderating it to actually be "ideas without authors" would be a nightmare. People really want to know who're the talking to and want other people to know them.<br/><br/>But if you build it, you can be sure I'd join, because I'd love to try it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261360/#Comment_261360" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T17:19:20+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  5:19PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a fascinating idea.<br/><br/>When we did Little Game Chef, I thought about having an anonymous forum.

Yeah, *here* I don't want everyone to "come into my house to talk games" then "immediately put a bag over their head when they enter". But if you're talking about an entirely new forum, the only acceptable answer here is "try it and see".<br/><br/>That's precisely why I made these forums, actually: As an experiment.

He'd probably prefer that I plagiarized his ideas rather than dragging him into this mess, but too bad! Ha!<br/><br/>Idea #1: Double blind peer review processes are one legitimate, real-world use of anonymous, non-attributable communication. Well, sorta. It's anonymous, and if you're a reviewer, you can't tell that this article was written by the author who wrote that other article you loved or hated. But the author is eventually going to publish the article with an actual name on it.<br/><br/>Idea #2: I was wrong about Iranian dissidents needing anonymity. Dissidents actually need social currency to build a following for their cause, at least according to Daniel, who I'm pretty sure understands these things really well.<br/><br/>Idea #3: Hey, doesn't <a href="http://i-would-knife-fight-a-man.com/forum" rel="nofollow">Knife Fight</a> let you post as Name Withheld, thus implementing exactly what you're talking about here? No one knows who you are because anyone can post as Name Withheld. Well, the moderators know who you are and can enforce community standards. So what if people just have long conversations on Knife Fight without attribution? How's that working out?<br/><br/>Idea #4: In your scheme, are moderators also users of the forum? If so, they can tell who is who and thus enjoy identity privileges no one else has. If not, how can you tell they're not cheating and being users?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261416/#Comment_261416" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T08:09:11+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  8:09AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            #1) Didn't know that. So idea exchange can happen without identity.<br/>#2) Interesting. The "need" for anonymity wasn't really a thing for me with this notion; more just what it would enable/prevent in terms of discussions. But if we need a list of folks who MUST have anonymity, consider the woman avoiding a stalker or an ex (such a woman wrote a VERY sharp open letter to Google about the Buzz fiasco).<br/>#3) I dunno--anyone go to Knife Fight for debate, design, or play discussions?<br/>#4) I didn't think about that. It seems obvious, then, to say, "No, mods can't be posters." I can't tell if they cheat or not, presuming they are smart enough to get a new IP address when switching user IDs (otherwise, I'd see the identical registries and, yep, ban that mod). But, rreally, I saw the moderation working more with Reporting, so I wouldn't need many (maybe not more than one, assuming it doesn't become Douchebag Central, due to the anonymity).<br/><br/>* Someone reports.<br/>* I check that post for violations (and what will qualify, hmmm?)<br/>* I delete it and warn the poster.<br/>* Three strikes and you're out, unless the violation is particularly egregious (what are heinous crimes of language, I wonder?).<br/>-----<br/>I am looking into what it would take to host such a forum. The primary issue is that I don't want to pay for another domain name, and as such, I either need a hosted site OR it will end up at davidartman.com. I'd prefer not to have the latter--DA.com isn't purely game-design and -play related (not even by half).<br/><br/>An alternative might be a Google Group or similar, but I don't know how much those support anonymity (especially given that they are driven by a mailing list, not a member registry).<br/><br/>And on that note: Thank, again, Andy for hosting SG!

People like Iranian dissidents certainly want some degree of *anonymity*.  But they may want to be able to build credibility as "AyatollahAssahollah666" or whatever.<br/><br/>Second, there's an asymmetry in the situation.  People using the internet to pass information about what's going on in, say, China, need personal credibility because you're *not* just assessing their ideas.  My ideas about the quality of the Chinese political system might be just as good as a Chinese democracy activist's.  But the activist needs you to believe that s/he is presenting accurate information about events - which has a lot to do with you believing that she is well-placed to observe them, and that's tied to having a particular identity and a track record of being right/truthful, even if not to his or her real name.  So I'm not sure it's applicable here.  The best analogy would be something like wanting to know that when someone says, "I played Apocalypse World and it suxxored," that they're not just making stuff up.<br/><br/>That said, as a general point, I think it's easy to overestimate how well "ideas" can be divorced from things about the context and actual world.  A paper of mine went through blind review at a journal, presumably so the ideas could be judged on their own.  But in order to make the case for those ideas, I need to talk about things like what counterinsurgency warfare is like.  Sure, I cite sources - but is it really totally irrelevant to, say, your judgment of how well I assess those empirical sources to know that I've never served in combat myself?  I dunno - I think it might be relevant and something blind peer review would miss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261484/#Comment_261484" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T14:01:43+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  2:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I told you I was gonna drag you into this, you whiner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261490/#Comment_261490" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T14:35:45+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  2:35PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Daniel, it would seem that credibility is an issue, the loss of which, with pure non-attribution, would lead to difficulty in judging statements presented?<br/><br/>Again, I think that's true for many objective endeavors; but I do not believe that it is true for the largely subjective work that we do, both in design and through AP (play analysis). Furthermore, you very example of empirical sources actually helps problems of comprehension: if such sources are quoted, while posting some idea, then not only can they be reviewed but your use of them can be, too. And that will be non-biased--I won't need to know whether you've served in the armed forces, because I can read your attributed expert(s), decide on the degree to which I trust *them*, and then do rather basic logical processes to see if your use of their premises or conclusions is sound or applicable.<br/><br/>Yet, if all I ever see is, "I served three tours in Afghanistan," then I face only an Argument from Authority--you might have been a base cook, for all I *know*. But any assertions you make from experience--true OR false!--I can judge based on their applicability to the ideas being presented. In a sense, any "truth" one conveys through non-contextual presentation (of authority or of experience) has to stand on its own and, as such, I think would be far more powerful than one which, ultimately, relies on "trust me, I know!" to carry any weight.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm misinterpreting you?

Thanks to my new rule that everyone entering my home will wear identical featureless white masks, I'll never be able to retaliate!<br/><br/>David: A few things:<br/><br/>Yeah, the main part of the reason I clarified the comment of mine that Adam was paraphrasing was because I *don't* think the situation of a dissident is directly analogous; dissidents have different reasons for wanting  attributability.<br/><br/>That said, no that's not an Argument from Authority - that's reporting experiences, when/if they're relevant.  An Argument from Authority is something like, "Daniel Levine said it, and he flaunts his degree around, so it must be true."  "I was in Afghanistan and saw XYZ" is reporting an observation.  Trusting observation reports requires credibility of the person doing the reporting, or at least no reason to think that the person isn't credible (most of the time, when someone says something mundane happened to them, we just believe them).<br/><br/>Subjective/objective isn't the distinction you want.  If we were just talking about subjective things, then there'd be no question even of assessing ideas.  We'd just be having conversations that went "I love Burning Empires."  "Sweet, so do I."  "I don't, I prefer Heavenly Hash."  You seem to mean something more like abstract/empirical.<br/><br/>That said, a huge amount of discussion of games will not be totally, or often even mostly, on the "abstract" side of that divide.  Actual Play seems to be relevant from time to time.   Sure, you can assess every play report as a hypothetical - "If everyone really did start bleeding from their eyes when they played Mutant City Blues, then it probably is a poorly designed game," but that's... kinda limiting.<br/><br/>Yes, you can run down every source to check someone's use of it.  But jeez, who has the time?  Citations are there so that people can check if they want to know more or if they suspect your use is off.  If you start from the assumption that all citations must be verified, you're never going to get anywhere.  Human beings developed the practice of trusting people so that we could build on their knowledge instead of each of us having to start from scratch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261713/#Comment_261713" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T14:01:20+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  2:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm reading this thread and all I get is a memory of that nice Abalone forum LARP we had some time ago. Anyone remembers it?<br/><br/>It was a fun experiment, and even while it collapsed in the end, I learned several cool things from it.<br/><br/>One of them was the effect of anonymity. You had to post things in character, and even while you knew the people there were people you had seen at S-G, you didn't know who was who. So you based your interactions more in the roleplaying and characterization. And <b>then</b> people told whose character they were playing. And then I got to go all "Ohhhhhh" when matching my previous knowledge (or social currency, if you may) and the way I kept thinking about the <b>character</b>. And I do believe that previous knowledge would have affected my interactions with some of them.<br/><br/>Funny thing is that same anonymity might have had a severe impact on the forum's collapse.
