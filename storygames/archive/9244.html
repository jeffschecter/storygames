I'm not really talking about creating the actual details of the culture but merely the broader strokes of color invoked by a consistent naming scheme.<br/><br/>Like, I have this Sci-Fi culture that is primarily White, European, Western, whatever and it's the default culture the PC's come from but it is not where play will take place.  Nothing I can come up with is satisfying, it's either too cheesy in a Sci-Fi sort of way or completely boring.<br/><br/>Usually I pick a real-life culture/language to base a society off of and derive the name/language from this base.  For instance, I have a Nahuatl based Nomadic/Indian culture which will be called "Huac" which comes from the Nahuatl word for "star".  That is satisfying to me.<br/><br/>How do you come up with names and balance the exotic with cheese?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204476/#Comment_204476" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T11:19:19+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 11:19AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use the <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/names/" rel="nofollow">Story Games Names Project</a> myself.

Thus, a name like FragDown666 or Arthur@security.asgardco.luminous_system.tarsus4_planet.carnival_nation.freehold_city might just be fine ways to name someone - even yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
