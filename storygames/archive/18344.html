This raised the question of a chaperone.<br/><br/>Sophronia (the 9-inch clockwork fairy: )I make a marvelous chaperone. I don't need to sleep. What other chaperone can you say that about?<br/><br/>Victor: You can say it about any, but then you'd be Gregory.<br/><br/>Next came the question of whether the invisible flying carriage they traveled in to speed things up would or would not have horses.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Fine, I will bewitch the damned horses. (to the horses) You are by no means flying. Those horseshoes were removed for a Good Reason.<br/><br/>That reason was that fairy magic doesn't work when there's too much cold iron around.<br/><br/>Later, there was a discussion about families, not unusual given that one of the campaign Aspects is Family Can Be Complicated.<br/><br/>Reginald / Gregory: All of us have problematic families -- let's not go making comparisons.<br/><br/>Sophronia: My family is perfectly wonderful.<br/><br/>Reginald: So is mine, but that doesn't stop it from being problematic.<br/><br/>Later:<br/><br/>Sophronia: Your sense of responsibility will be the death of you.<br/><br/>Reginald: Quite possibly, but I hope it will be the salvation of many others.<br/><br/>And, Our Heroes found an ally in Sir Daniel.<br/><br/>Daniel: Are you freemasons?<br/><br/>Victor: No, but that's a good idea.<br/><br/>Regiald: We're Kerbereans. It's like Freemasons, but with less badges and more world threatening dangers.<br/><br/>Victor: And better coffee.<br/><br/>Sophronia (whose creator made the Kerberos Club Coffee Machine): Oh yes, we have excellent coffee!<br/><br/>And, we learned that this is perhaps not the best group of heroes to send on covert operations.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Do take care of Alice!<br/><br/>Alice: I don't see why I have a secret identity at all!

Every character faced Death at some point; one still lived, barely, at the end of the game.<br/><br/>It was an interesting session. Things definitely didn't go as planned. I set up a destroyer spacecraft as a dungeon, with 2 really tough bad guys and 1 lieutenant that was pretty rough on his own (statted as an Orc Breaker). I placed equipment around the "dungeon," and left some friction between the two main villains, hoping that would give the PCs an advantage, but they split and took on each villain separately, which resulted in total carnage. They did achieve their goals, though! The Pirate Dragon was not able to take his destroyer to Titan to try to overthrow the Solar Emperor, and the evil robot M10 was not able to take the Princess of Titan to Earth, as everyone perished when the PCs managed to send the destroyer plummeting to the surface of Tethys.<br/><br/>It left me wondering if I made this session too hard. I'm not sure; things could have gone really differently, I think, but I'm not sure. Anyway, we still had a blast! I feel like I finally got fronts and how to use them this session, which was cool. Previously, I had a hard time with Grim Portents, as I wrote them as things that would happen in the fiction that the characters would see. I never could use them, as the fiction wasn't ever set up to reflect them. This time, I made them things that could happen without the PCs present, and they were easy to use. Having one front be a ship in the process of falling apart made this super-easy: any time I had a hard move, I could destroy the ship a bit more. As you could guess, we got to the last Portent: "Boom."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413747/#Comment_413747" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-08T10:44:15+00:00" title="May  8, 2013 10:44AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BUT DID TOP HAT SURVIVE<br/><br/>WE NEED TO KNOW                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413750/#Comment_413750" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-08T11:05:19+00:00" title="May  8, 2013 11:05AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Top Hat is alive, as well as the White Ape Technician the party left him with, Bonesaw.

I was really happy with how readily the system lets you share the spotlight, and the way the pacing mechanism played out with the Fox's high Wonder...was fantastic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414036/#Comment_414036" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-14T05:21:38+00:00" title="May 14, 2013  5:21AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2013 5:22AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Fiasco with the Mayor last night.

PCs were the crew of the steamship known as <i>The Owl </i>(Captain, 1st Mate and pilot). The final scenes happened as The Owl landed on a platform outside the hidden fortress of the Pirate King deep within The Remnants. Captain Vance professed his love for the Lady Blackbird and asked her to stay, then turned away from her before she could answer him. Then as Lady Blackbird stood on the platform just outside the ship awaiting the Pirate King, a puzzled, emotional look on her face, Snargle the pilot ambled down to "talk sense to her". But still, Lady Blackbird stood between the unknown and her own past, undecided.<br/><br/>The final two "shots" of the game (camera shots like a movie) were<br/>1) The camera pulling back on Lady Blackbird with her bodyguard Naomi standing by her side as she looked between The Owl and the Pirate King and his retinue slowly walking the long walkway to her. <br/>2) Then, a shot of The Owl zipping up and away from the platform to head back into The Remnants, tracking the Owl as it flies right towards the camera and past it, the last picture is the empty platform: no Pirate King, no Lady Blackbird.

As a high elf of the golden halls, I was thoroughly incensed by this heresy, and was more than eager to eradicate this blight from the wood.

We did the Temple of Hera adventure from Ben Robbins (this <a href="http://www.agon-rpg.com/resources.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and it really helped me to learn the system. I'm a big fan of systems that reward me for playing hard as a GM in conflicts, and (despite my limited knowledge of the system to begin with) it felt very natural, and cool, to be able to hit the players with all my NPCs had. I just wish I'd realised the sorceress had a Gaze attack earlier...<br/><br/>They blew the Horn and caused the satyrs to flee, then had an anxious moment when they remembered Hera's instructions... we did a little flashback and I read the boxed text again from the adventure as they tried to remember her exact words.... and realised their quest was to slay the defilers, not just let them run off! An aced Athletics challenge later and they'd cornered the satyrs in a mountain pass, from whence they slew them mightily.<br/><br/>I still had lots of strife left at the end (probably my fault from being too timid with minions early on) so it made me think I should probably have some 'stock' NPCs ready - I could've easily added in a brutal satyr leader, or even Pan himself, as an additional opponent, but couldn't face statting him up on the fly.<br/><br/>Really cool game though - I've already put down to run it at Furnace (con in Sheffield, UK) in the Autumn - and it could well become a con/one-shot regular for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415071/#Comment_415071" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T19:20:16+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  7:20PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksPZxUi8gQ" rel="nofollow">We played Viewscream!</a><br/><br/>It was intense, and I would love to do it again.

Sophronia made a thunderstorm which was praised as part of the decorations, especially after she stopped and all the water vanished, doing no damage to hair or clothing. Sophronia has forbidden her fiance from trying to convince her creator / father to stay, standing firmly by Take Me As I Am for everyone, no matter how unhappy it may make her.<br/><br/>Reginald exchanged notes with the NPC Talos, a 20 foot tall iron golem who is Sophronia's cousin. Talos wants to help the Chartists. Reginald wants to make sure Talos understands that the Great Game of the World is not chess, but poker.<br/><br/>GM: You want to join him!<br/><br/>Player: No, I want him to join me!<br/><br/>GM: Semantics!<br/><br/>Player: I want us to subvert one another. <br/><br/>One player decided to be the translation track for the Talos-Sophronia conversation.<br/><br/>Sophronia: What have you been doing?<br/><br/>Talos: Playing chess and trying to learn things.<br/><br/>Translator: Manipulating the situation and spying.<br/><br/>Talos: Trying to make more friends than enemies.<br/><br/>Translator: Making enemies.<br/><br/>Later:<br/><br/>Talos: When you get married, there will be a truce during the wedding?<br/><br/>Sophronia: Of course there will be!
