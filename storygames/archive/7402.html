Missed Frederik's questions!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frederik J. Jensen</cite>So Matthijs, how did you get this going? How much does the pupils participate - what do they actually do? What are the role of the teachers?</blockquote>\nRune Andersen is the guy who invented the method. He's responsible for getting teachers and schools to try it out, and has achieved some very good results with different students. I started working for the company in... November? I'm in charge of developing the method - basically, simplifying it and streamlining it so teachers with no prior role-playing experience can use it with a minimum of preparation. I also write scenarios + manuals. <br/><br/>In role-playing terms, the pupils are mostly railroaded through a scenario with some simple choices, where they sometimes roll dice for their characters' actions. The main thing when it comes to learning, though, is that they gather Work Points (aka XP) for doing school work. The harder and more focused you work, the more points you score. The idea is that this motivates kids to work at their task, whether they're "smart" or "dumb". Kids who are used to handing in stuff as fast as they can, because everything's too easy for them, score points for working longer and challenging themselves. Kids who are used to failing at a subject every time score points for asking questions, trying to find solutions etc. Everyone works at their own level, which means <i>everyone can experience progress and mastery</i>.<br/><br/>Teachers are GMs and teachers. They run the scenarios, and observe and guide the work process when pupils are working. They're drilled to tell the students again and again: Use all available time. Involve everyone in your group. Focus on the task. <br/><br/>(There's also a lot of info and discussion on L\xe6relyst over at the <a href="http://educationalroleplaying.net/" rel="nofollow">educational role-playing</a> forum).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165573/#Comment_165573" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T04:56:16+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  4:56AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (The main difference between us and \xd8sterskov is that \xd8sterskov is a school run by experienced gamers - very cool and competent people, I must say.

We're aiming to have them translated, so we can show what we're doing to English-speaking schools. \n<blockquote>I'm curious, how did the gaming culture over there evolve?</blockquote>\nOy. Big subject. I have an article on Norwegian gaming publications (which will be the intro for the N\xf8rwegian Style book), but that's not exactly what you're asking for, is it? <br/><br/>I think that, in Norway as in many countries, there are several "gaming cultures". There's the mainstream consumer gamers, who like their White Wolf metaplots and use the Golden Rule as they see fit. They're all over, and they're having fun. I'm not sure it's very different from what you'll find at any con anywhere, really - a lot of different people who just like to roll dice and game. <br/><br/>Then there's the much smaller culture of game designers - a tiny crowd of 10-30 people. We're heavily influenced by our general culture, which is social democratic and (used to be) all about everyone sharing stuff and being equal, which kind of shows in our games. Norwegian designers are also often writers and/or journalists with a university degree (not unlike Denmark, I believe), which also influences things, I guess. <br/><br/>The influence of Tomas M\xf8rkrid on the current school of game designers can't be overestimated, I think. He designed games while the rest of us were still kids. At the same time, for a few years some of us were heavily into U. S. indie games, but right now, it seems like nobody over here is using dice much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165929/#Comment_165929" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T09:41:56+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  9:41AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One set of questions begets another set!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>We're heavily influenced by our general culture, which is social democratic and (used to be) all about everyone sharing stuff and being equal, which kind of shows in our games.</blockquote>\nThat's an interesting remark that I hadn't thought about before.

S. indie scene, it's hard not to notice that in the U. S., the division of narrative authority (who gets to talk) is often based on conflict, competition, and buying time with tokens or points, whereas in Norwegian games, it's often based on taking turns, waiting until the other party has finished their scene, or just left up to the players assuming they'll be civilized and let everyone participate. It's maybe a banal over-simplification, but it's not unsurprising if you assume that the U. S. culture is based on competitiveness and ideas of free markets, while the Norwegian one is based on everyone participating and everyone being treated as equals. (Which we don't do in real life, of course - but the ideal is still there).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I'm curious why you feel that the dice have largely been done away with?

Is this a reflection of your strong LARP culture bleeding into tabletop?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure exactly why. For my part, I know it's had to do with playing so many dice systems where task/conflict resolution is a speed bump, stopping the flow of the game while everyone calculates numbers and checks tables and rules. Very few systems are simple enough that their usefulness outweighs their clunkyness (Lacuna and IaWA are two exceptions). A lot of Norwegian games in recent years have used cards to establish scenes (Until we Sink, for example, and my never-quite-finished Will the Emperor Fall), and Itras By is also using cards to spice up/deconstruct the narrative flow and for conflict resolution. Not sure that LARP has anything to do with it directly - I'm not much of a LARPer myself - but perhaps players used to LARPing have a better toolkit for handling on-the-spot improvisation and resolution, since they're sometimes alone in the woods with no rules and have to keep the game going?\n<blockquote>And I'm presuming that L\xe6relyst doesn't use dice, correct?  Are there situations that need to be "judged" by the teachers?</blockquote>\nIn L\xe6relyst I've kind of come full circle. Since I'm free to do whatever I want with my games, and have done a lot of experimenting and weird stuff, I didn't have anything to prove or any huge chips on my shoulders when designing that game; I could just look at what teachers and kids needed. So it uses dice, because they're a fun and recognizable game element that everyone understands - both students and teachers. And expecting <i>every</i> kid to be creative at the spur of the moment, and <i>all</i> teachers to improvise and exercise judgement about the story, is unrealistic - much better to have a simple and unambiguous way of dealing with risk and conflict; especially one that's not open to negotiation - once the dice show you fail, well, you fail. That's it. Complaining to the teacher won't help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
