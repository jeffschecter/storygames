Mutually Assured Destruction routines\xe2\u20ac\u201da nightmare from the 1980\xe2\u20ac\u2122s\xe2\u20ac\u201dwere triggered after a terrorist attack.  Few survived; those who lived have to make a new world for themselves.<br/><br/>The game focuses on the definition of self in the midst of crisis.  Who do you want to be?  Will the others let you be that person?  Will being that person lead everyone to their doom?<br/><br/>See you at the beach!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
