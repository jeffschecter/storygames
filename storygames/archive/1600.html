<p>So I've been taking them for granted for a long time, and then I thought, <em>these are horrible things.</em></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, a character sheet is where we keep information that the other players do not need to know, interact with, or have authority over. (Yes, I don't consider the Polaris device a character sheet.)</p>
<p>Why do we have things that the other players don't need to know, interact with, or have authority over? How does that improve the gaming experience? Board games don't have character sheets. I think they are onto something.</p>

                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>Drawing an analogy to your design tendencies here.  You design, in part, to create structures so that you can do certain types of things without thinking about and remembering them all the time.  The mechanics take care of it (that is, they remind you to do it).  Character sheets <i>can</i> be used in a similar way.  They hold the information you are going to want to access later, but don't need to keep in your head all the time.  I take it that this is one of the things they do in <i>HeroQuest</i> for instance.<br/><br/>Of course character sheets could look way different than they do.  I take it that cards in most CCGs serve a similar purpose: they allow you to access information (special rules) when you need it, but not have to memorize it all.<br/><br/>Oh, also, I am currently reading you to be thinking that character sheets are necessarily personal/private or something like that.  Where is that idea coming from?<br/><br/>thomas                        </div>

                            Character sheets mainly contain the resources a player can bring to bear in the game.  And many games are way to complex to remember everything.                        </div>

                            My checkbook balance is pretty important too, but I still have to check it regularily.  it would be nice if everything important were memorable, but it's not a practical expectation.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that board games have entire swaths of design committed to how information is hidden, shared and distributed.  Some of that may be informative upon the use of character sheets, but the differences are also telling.<br/><br/>But all that's kind of an aside.  The heart of the question here is why players need things they have authority over (and the knowledge and responsibilities that come with it).<br/><br/>And the obvious answer is of course the don't need it.  Hippie games where everyone has equal knowledge and authority over all characters are entirely viable.<br/><br/>But if you decide that character identification is fun, and you're not obliged to, the utility in establishing ownership, identification and authority seems pretty clear cut.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Hmm...  Well, it definitely depends on the game, of course, but chances are, the information on my character sheet is something that other players are going to interact with.  If we're oh, say, about to go into battle with a baddie and we're figuring out our plan of attack, stuff like what abilities our characters have is going to come into play.  The other players don't usually have any control over what abilties my PC has, but whether my PC has fighting abilities or some kind of way cool fire magic is something they need to know and are going to interact with.  Frankly, I have a hard enough time remembering even small amounts of information if it's not written down in front of me, so the idea of having to remember all of the other PCs abilities as well without everyone having it written down kind of stresses me out. :)  OTOH, I've never played a game where the content of folks' character sheets was in any way closely guarded/not shared openly.  I guess I just assumed that character sheets were mainly just a tool for organizing information; I know that I often refer to mine when I'm trying to think up a novel way of resolving a conflict, because I can look at all of the different potential abilities or elements that I could bring into play.                        </div>

                            First of all, I am so glad that I saw the words <b>The Polaris Device</b>. I am glad to bear witness to the coolest term ever in roleplaying design.<br/><br/>In 2005, Ben Lehman created <b>THE POLARIS DEVICE</b>.<br/><br/>Sorry, back to the discussion-thing:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Or, to put a less draconian standard on our brains, if it's worth remembering, shouldn't it be worth remembering for everyone?</blockquote>
Imagine if everyone had instead of one piece of paper in front of them, three 11x17 sheets in front of them.<br/><br/>But I do agree on one thing: If you have some sort of hippie love mechanic like "Beliefs and Instincts" or "Contacts" or something that everyone else can use to help that player have a more awesome time, then there needs to be a Groups Sheet (a signle sheet for the middle of the table, or a second sheet which all players have) with all that stuff on it.<br/><br/>In fact, my bi-weekly group will be playing The Riddle of Steel in about a month or so. Around that time, I'm totally going to make a sheet which everyone attaches to their regular sheet which lists the Spiritual Attributes of the other characters.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Rob, your checkbook balance didn't have the opportunity to be <em>designed for</em> memorability. Otherwise though, right on.</p>
<p>Thomas, let's turn that assumption into a definition: 'A character sheet keeps personal records.' Other things, like the range strip or Polaris cosmos or whatever, is a some other kinda sheet.</p>

                            Without a character sheet you can't keep track of things that need to be written down about your dude, the 7 +/-2 problem  So you can either design around the hard limits of human information retention and retrieval, or you can record it somehow - a job for which paper serves admirably.  <br/><br/>Character sheets grow and change and grow ragged and stained over long term play as well, and become objects with character themselves.  That's fun and cool.  <br/><br/>Side note:  Dave "Supreme Commander" Younce dropped some knowledge on us at Nerdly in the form of $20 whiteboards that would make a compelling communal substitute for individual paper sheets.                        </div>

                            Imagine if, in addition to everyone having a piece of paper in front of them, there were little sheets of paper passed around the table from player to player telling them how to most effectively interact with the other characters in the game.<br/><br/>...you'd have spoils scrips from <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>.<br/><br/>Shreyas, I think this is a good topic and a good question to ask.  I think we're in the midst of revising the concept of the character sheet, finding new and different applications for it, and tossing out stuff that isn't worthwhile for our current purposes.  Questions like these help us do that.<br/><br/><em>Polaris</em>' sheet, <em>Mountain Witch's</em> sheet, the minutiae sheet from Shock:, even <em>Drowning and Falling's</em> sheet are all picking at assumptions and seeing what happens when the concept is taken apart and reconfigured.  There are tons of answers to your question, each tailored to individual games.  What are the potential uses for a repository of important information?  <em>Legion.</em> </div>

Andy, I'm planning on doing exactly that in my upcoming game.  The players characters are the protectors of a community.  The community itself will provide resources available to all players, kept on a separate sheet.                        </div>

                            Like others, for me the character sheet is all about remembering stuff. In simpler games, they're not needed. Like when I play PTA, the GM keeps track of everyone's screen presence, and that's it. We usually remember our skills/contacts, and fan mail is kept track of by tokens or whatever. (It's nice not having any paper in front of you.)<br/><br/>But interesting, for <i>In a Land Called</i> (which is still in the works), I think the group is going to have to keep a log to keep track of all the setting stuff they create. I think a significant amount of setting will be generated over time, but we'll have to see how easy it will be to remember stuff.                        </div>

                            Interestingly, the Amber rules that I'm working up have no paper character sheet.  Your character's status is entirely contained in the cards you're carrying, whether they're in your deck face up or face down, or in your pocket.  For those with Psyche less than chaos-level, I have little booklets printed up where people can keep track of which of their brothers they hate, and which brothers hate them.                        </div>

                            Rob nailed it guys, the character sheet is about responsibility. It's where you store the things you're responsible for knowing, managing, and recording. Without a way of managing who is responsible for what information, a game can quickly devolve into chaos. Can you imagine a game where one person is responsible for the record keeping? (actually, I think in Universalis, one person IS reponsible for record keeping - and they never get around to doing much playing). Or worse, have you seen what happens when nobody has the explicit job of keeping records? If your character has a beleif about mine, where does it get written? If you're playing Burning Wheel, it's on your character sheet. If we're playing Best Friends, it affects what's on my character sheet. When I play a crunchy game like Burning Wheel, I make it a priority to know how the stuff on my character sheet works. I may have no idea what your character's "Badass" trait does, but I'd better know what my "Cunning" trait means.                        </div>

                            Correct me if I'm wrong (and I know you will) but the main problem with character sheets seems to be that, while we want shared responsibility and shared access, we're just not, ah, able to see the paper across the table. All the games I've played where character information is looked on as shared property but managed by one person, we simply have to acknowledge there will be a certain amount of asking around.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you could work out a 3-D character sheet (stacks of chips on stats? Glass beads?) or one which would be easy to read from a distance (4 stats written in black marker pen?) then the questioning might do away, but in fact I don't mind it as long as it doesn't get too excessive.                        </div>

                            Character sheets blow.  By which I mean they are a tool for certain kinds of record keeping, but they are definitely overused out of habit and have become a crutch more often than a true tool. Designing games without character sheets is the bomb. But you could probably guess I'd say that (5K, Waiting/Tea, etc).                        </div>

                            I really only bother with character sheets when playing something with a ton of rules, like D&amp;D or Shadowrun.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time, my friends and I play games of our own creation (I hate the negative connotations of "freeform," espescially when our games have plenty of rules, if placed elsewhere). These games don't have character sheets at all.<br/>
<br/>
Now, several years into some of these games, some of us are finding that notes are helpful. These aren't sheets that track a character's game statistics; but reminders, self-made maps and the occasional note on character ideas (such as when someone comes up with a new idea for a character's background in the middle of a tense scene).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I pride myself on my memory. I have little trouble memorizing passages, stat blocks, facts, etc. But when it comes to -names!- Oh, how I hate remembering them. :)<br/>
<br/>
And so you'll see that most of my notes are simply a name, with perhaps a few words or a sentence of a description. "Alyssa - sister's friend, mage, blue eyes."<br/>
<br/>
So once again, they can be very helpful in some games, in which case I'll keep them. But I love not having to deal with them (one less thing to inhibit gaming on the go, which is popular with my friends and I).                        </div>

                            I don't understand the hostility to the character sheet.  Some (many, perhaps) are designed poorly, and others quite well.  But all of the anti-character sheet rhetoric smacks of "Don't put me in a <i>box</i>, man, I'm not a number, I'm a free man" rebellion-to-rebel.  Which was fine for me when I was, say, eighteen, but a similar number of years later I look back and go, hey, y'know what?  Those boxes are just perspectives.  Useful ones.  With all of the think outside the box vibe these days, more than anything I want to spend some time thinking inside it, and making it a better box.<br/>
<br/>
Take away my character sheets and you'll cheapen my play.  Guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
(Tell me that you're using the term "character sheet" in some way other than what is obvious to the common parlance of it and I'm getting all het up about what is not meant by the term, and I'll laugh, point you over at the zealotry threads, and continue to ignore said threads.)                        </div>

                            1001 Nights has this thing where you use your senses and clothing and stuff to make touchstones with your character. This is cool. <br><br>A character sheet is another way of doing that. Done right it is very cool. Done wrong it's a useless appendage. <br><br>So, are character sheets neccisary? Nope, not at all. <br/><br/>Does that mean character sheets are crap? The very idea is stupid beyond the normal definition of the word. The fact that we're even talking about it in those terms seems to be because of a lot of silly assumptions about what "character sheet" means that aren't actually what it means. The very need to redefine the "polaris device" is such an excercise in junk rhetoric that it nearly cripples my ability to take the rest of the post seriously. <br/><br/>Now, with that rant out of the way, one of the things Mo and I have been looking at doing for some of the games we're working on is having group character sheets, setting sheets, and things like that. It falls in line with things like the Shock minutae sheet and Adam's idea above that there be one big sheet on the table that everyone shares. The interesting thing is that some of these sheets are not character sheets and some are. Its just that when your character is in the spotlight your massive poster-sized sheet goes onto the table and everyone else's comes off. At that point the whole group focuses on your characters stuff, and everyone uses it and has authority over various parts of it. <br/><br/>So, I guess I'm with Josh -- it isn't about "Character sheets are crap" it is "Character sheets are just one more tool, just be sure you're using them to create the effect you want in the game you are making."                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I think your basic problem is that you've accepted one of the popular pathologies about how character sheets are handled (you don't look at other people's character sheets) as inherant to the idea of character sheets. It isn't.                        </div>

                            I think there are a lot of assumptions here.<br/><br/>Firstly, we can't look at each other's sheets, I don't think in my group people do much but mostly because it's quicker to ask someone what's there.    Anyway it's a false assumption.<br/><br/>Secondly, that there are no legitimate reasons to keep things secret.  Most games I play there aren't particularly, but in more conspiracy orientated games or certain other games there may be excellent reasons not to see each others sheets.  A game about trust for example, who and when, could potentially benefit from a lack of access to people's sheets.  Paranoia almost seems to demand it.  I had a great PC once who was a physician, save that he had no skill, he simply lied the whole time and referred his patients to assistants.  Part of the fun was the secret, the other players knew with time but it was more fun to have it a genuine secret to be genuinely learnt on that occasion (other occasions everyone knowing from the start might be more fun).<br/><br/>That the game has no resources that are better managed that way.  Many do.<br/><br/>I mean, if you want a game in which character information is pooled then the sheet is a poor tool for that, undoubtedly, but often that isn't a major consideration for a game.<br/><br/>Essentially, I think this thread is crippled to be blunt by unspoken assumptions, both about how sheets are used and about what kinds of games we are playing.  I think those assumptions are likely incorrect, and as such the topic is flawed.<br/><br/>Now, are character sheets always a good tool?  No, and I think there is real merit in discussing where they are and where not and how to make use of them.  Adam's shared sheet is an interesting concept, and for some games that might work very well if it's use was not too impractical.                        </div>

                            This is really interesting, so thanks for challenging the assumptions, Shreyas.  Some thoughts:<br/><br/>I think a character sheet can help put someone in the right head-space for play.  In The Roach you have to keep track of five things (plus a card), so I make it clear in the rules that a character sheet isn't strictly <em>necessary</em>.

<blockquote>All you sheet haters - talk to me about functional and fun games that depend on accessing more information than a person can reliably retain. Start with Dogs in the Vineyard.</blockquote>
Come on, Jason, that's unfair. Dogs was designed using a character sheet, so it's pointless to try and take the character sheet out of it. I could say "You could use index cards" and you'd just say "Ah! But the character sheet works better". Of course it does. That's how it was designed.<br/><br/>The problem, IMHO, is: why is the player character sheet the default? Sure, we accept you need to retain information. But why can't there be more shared character sheets, like BtI; or click-lock things, like Capes; or characters represented by hands of cards; or index cards; or by a Tarot spread; or by pieces on a board? Why are the vast majority of games designed around this one, very specifically designed tool?<br/><br/>Actually, I'll tell you why. It's because D&amp;D did it that way and game designers are too lazy, or blinkered, to find other ways of representing characters. Me included, of course.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Jared's right. Although I'll say more than that, now that I have time to write about it.<br/><br/>Contrary to Judson Lester's experience, I found *The Design of Everyday Things* to be very useful in my thinking about roleplaying games. So much so that I plan on writing some essays about an RPG design philosophy based on those concepts.<br/><br/>There were a couple of those concepts that seemed to have direct bearing on the discussion of character sheets. One is the difference between knowledge in the head and knowledge in the world. Knowledge in the head, for any particular task, is slower than  knowledge in the world, since you have to recall the specific relevant fact you want to use, but users with a lot of knowledge in the head on how to do these tasks can be more flexible and creative in their actions. Knowledge in the world, on the other hand, can enable users to perform necessary tasks with very little thought, if the interface to their tools/equipment is designed right.<br/><br/>That's what a character sheet is: an interface to the system. It can be a mnemonic device or a repository of secrets, but these are neither necessary nor primary. The character sheet tells you (or should tell you) how to play the game, what's important to know. If you see a list of +1/+2/+3 modifiers with names on your character sheet, the naturaldesire is to add those to something. If you see some kind of tracker made of checkboxes or circles, you know you will be marking them off, using up the resource they represent.<br/><br/>We've occasionally talked about the relevance of board and card game design to roleplaying games. The reason why board and card games are easier to play is because they have a lot more knowledge in the world, stuff printed on the board or on the cards. That's all a character sheet is, another way to put knowledge into the world. It's just that most character sheets aren't designed very well.<br/><br/>A couple good design examples: *My Life With Master* puts the victory conditions on the character sheet, so you know what you are playing towards. *Sorcerer* has the nice wound tracker along the side that you can use without erasing, plus it has the back of the sheet, which tells you and the GM what the focus of play will be.<br/><br/>Shared maps are really just character sheets, even if people are loathe to call them such, because of the connotations of "character sheet". I've got a game or two in the works that use shared maps. My task, as a designer, is to make the rules of play and the use of the shared map mesh in such a way that the map will tell the players what they can do, so that they don't have to look up rules in a book (although, perversely, I am also making the book an artifact of play, so certain things *will* be looked up.) I will also have traditional character sheets, but there's no rule about keeping character sheets secret. It's more like a set of resources that players can bring to bear on the activity taking place on the map.<br/><br/>If you have a game rule that you think can be better expressed as playing cards, poker chips, or something else, you should certainly do so. But don't discount character sheets; there's a hell of a lot of room for better design in this area. I find the whole concept of designing character sheets the way you would design a dashboard for a car or the interface for a computer game an exciting, inspiring idea.                        </div>

Honestly, I think there is a reason behind the character sheets: they're something you can include in the game.  There's a mindset that says "you have to give the players everything they need," the challenge of which is was the <i>raison detre</i> of Cheapass Games.  A character sheet is in the book, and you can Xerox it, which is somehow inside that boundary.  But it's a step that designers are still taking alone, and for each game, to say "oh, and you'll need these common household items to play this game."  Jason doesn't ask you to cut your own roach cards.  Maybe that's being blinkered...

John, we're all friends here.  Just call me "Judson."  And reading the rest of your post, I think we both took different things away from <cite>The Design of Everyday Things,</cite> although it's all in there.

<p>I wasn't being formal. I may have been confused, but I thought there were two Judsons. There are certainly a heck of a lot of Johns.</p>
<p>I just finished reading DoET, myself (although I began reading it about six years ago.) I plan on re-reading it, and writing about affordances in RPG design, proper feedback, and anything else that I can pull from it. And then, rewriting my earlier RPG designs to make better use of those insights. I've decided: that index cards and pennies in <em>Last Breath</em> and <em>Serpentine Thunder</em> was a mistake, I should use a shared map instead; that using the character sheet in <em>Court of 9 Chambers</em> as a place to build random event tables is pretty good, but the group tracking procedures need improvement; and that making the position of dice in <em>Depths of Kanthe</em> signicant is a great idea, but I need to push it more, really make the interface reflect the possible outcomes (i.e. put more knowledge of the game rules into knowledge in the world.)</p>

But, see, there is stuff about characters that feels proprietary in most games.<br/><br/>It's the Other Stuff that confuses me.  Why isn't there a "GM sheet" for their stuff, and a 'situation sheet' for everyone?                        </div>

Oh.  That's my fault.  A little while ago I changed my username from "judson" to "Judson Lester" in an attempt to be more friendly.  Or rather, to completely crush my usual instinct of separating myself from my online persona.  At least on Story Games, I don't want to do that.<br/><br/>Anyway, when I was reading DoET, it was with an eye towards interface design.  But it's application towards RPGs is worth exploring.  Keep in mind that in a game, you occasionally don't want to make everything obvious and simple.<br/><br/>But back to the point of the thread: the utility of character sheets.                        </div>

What I was trying to get at is that it <em>was</em> designed for use with a sheet, and the sheet very effectively supports play.  So saying "character sheets are teh devilz" is not productive.  They are an artifact of the retention/retrieval problem, and there are lots of other ways to address that.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite> They are an artifact of the retention/retrieval problem, and there are lots of other ways to address that.</blockquote>
I was talking with Dev and Ben recently about Primetime Adventures' approach to retention/retrieval, which is both unadulterated genius and maddening to me as a designer and player.<br/><br/>The metagame of PTA gets you in the mode of telling stories "like a TV show."  You figure out a premise, you choose main characters, you divy up screen presence, etc. On top of this, the game book provides a ton of suggestions about how TV shows are structured and what an episode might look like and similar things.<br/><br/>Then play begins.<br/><br/>And the system does very little to support or encourage players in telling stories in the style of serial TV drama. Instead, it relies mostly on the primordial understanding of <i>how television works</i> that's been indoctrinated into all of us by years of staring at the boob-tube. The game tells you that "this is a TV show" and players respond accordingly, producing play that feels like a TV show.<br/><br/>In setting things up this way, Matt avoided having extensive mechanics that structured episode plots or framed scenes or established pacing or set endgame (or episode ending) conditions or did any number of things that haven't quite made it into the gaming vocabulary yet (framing specific "camera shots," deciding which characters are in a given scene, managing subplots, etc). He cut through all that with the swift sword that is -- basically -- freeform. The players share an understanding of what play is supposed to look like and, sure enough, that's the kind of play that results.  Booyeah, the essence of freeform and a good example of a game being more of a <i>practice</i> than a specific set of rules.<br/><br/>The maddening part, for me, is trying to figure out what is actually going on in PTA play, since so much of it seems to be based on our collective understanding of television.  I totally want to develop techniques that help us structure scenes and sessions, but PTA does this largely by calling on us to rely on our instincts.  This is amazing, in that PTA could operate totally without character sheets and dice and a GM and still be completely effective, I think.  There is no retention/retrieval problem, because it asks you to use knowledge THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. You're not asked to memorize a bunch of rules or stats or new setting material. I wish more games would make similar moves to draw on our collective knowledge, aside from the traditional approach of relying on genre conventions.                        </div>

In traditional role playing games the GM has a lot of "GM sheets": the screen with lots of tables, the adventure module with the secret dungeon map and the master monster matrix, and even the battle map in today's D&amp;D (especially with Iron Heroes' concept of Combat Zones) can be seen as a "situation sheet".<br/><br/>N'est-ce pas?<br/><br/>Dirk                        </div>

 I think the primary reason we don't use boards is that they're feckin' annoying if you're going to play across more than one session. They're big unwieldy things to store for a week or more and you just know the cats gonna walk across it at some point, so you end up copying the details down onto paper so you can store the state.

                            In a game I was running for my five year old, I used a big science fair folding display board to hold the "Character sheets" - Basically big symbols for the characters with little icons representing thier "powers" - and the game map - which we drew in play - as well as some other record keeping.  I used re-usable tape, so we could pull the character sheets down when needed, but then everything stored neatly when we were done.<br/><br/>I added a small plastic "tackle box" to hold dice and stones and such; and then everything I needed for the game was quick and easy.<br/><br/>In retrospect, and reflecting on this thread, there was/is much to be said for the overall design I used.  It is much easier to work with than carrying an armload of books and clipboards and dice, etc. to run the Exalted game for the adults....                        </div>

<p>This is a question of appropriate design. If there's a format for quick storage state, perhaps using stickers or static cling sheets then the board is probably easier to manage and see than lots of individual sheets.</p>
<p>I find that I forget the stuff on everyone else's sheet, and it's my responsibility to be hitting that stuff.</p>

                            Since playing Shab-Al-Hiri Roach, I'm really really leaning towards the use of cards in lieu of character sheets. (The roach still uses character sheets of course, but that's the first time I've really played with cards in an RPG.) They're easy to store, have easily digested nuggets of information, and if designed in a certain way, can be easily understood from across the table without having to ask to look at a character sheet.                        </div>

                            Would there be less objection to the character sheet if, for instance, the stats were quite simple (as in a game like Dust Devils of Best Friends) and you could fit all of the players' stats onto each sheet? Divide the sheet into 6 and fill all the details in on each sheet so everyone has a copy. No equipment lists, of course. No space.<br/><br/>And I'd like to question the validity of writing your character sheet on a card and saying it isn't a character sheet anymore. A rose by any other name would just make you write smaller, but be functionally identical. And smell as sweet.                        </div>

                            Daniel, I had an idea for a game that would use a "group deck" from which you'd draw cards that defined your character for that session - the things for which he'd really shine and be successful at that week.  Everybody would be generally assumed to be good at everything, but the cards would be like random flags the GM could even tune week to week - somebody would be great at fixing stuff, somebody would be a great leader, and so forth - the fun would come from weird juxtaposition of roles, I think.  This strikes me as particularly suited for episodic play.                        </div>

                            I'm very much moving away from the idea of character sheets and towards the idea of "playmats," which involve physically putting tokens and such in designated areas. (I blame Tony.)<br/><br/>Before you poo-poo the idea, imagine it on green felt. Vegas baby!<br/><br/>Oh, the topic is <i>sell me on!</i>Um, okay...<br/><br/>The big circle full of stuff in Sorcerer/Polaris is a useful tool to make brainstorming about character more concrete and productive.<br/><br/>Oftentimes, there's a nice swath of blank space on which to doodle your character.<br/><br/>Sorry, I'm bitter since I played in the game that required <i>double-entry accounting</i> for all treasure and experience point gains and expenditures. Kinda causes me to sneer at the "responsibility" argument. In this case, the justification was, "What? Like the GM's gonna do all that for you?" Which neglects, "How is this tedious chore actually necessary to the fun?" For their creative agenda, perhaps. But not for mine.                        </div>

                            Jason, that's a great idea! You could even have the group make up the cards before the game begins, then randomly deal them out to each player, much like audience suggestions in an improv game.                        </div>

                            When I first started playing RPGs there were character sheets, but mostly no one used them. We made lists. Basically our character sheets were big lists of stuff we wanted to remember, that our characters had, that we needed, clues, notes, and doodles. I think that a character sheet became de riguer as desktop publishing came into vogue just because it is so easy. Now with Acrobat's advanced functionality the idea of the digital character sheet doing a lot of the work for you is a pretty liberating thing in as many ways as it is a limiting thing. In my own gaming metaphor, the character sheet is a mask for the player to wear. Many times in my own experience I can recall using the character sheet, or my list as it were, as a focus for centering myself and 'becoming' my character. Looking at your character picture, reviewing what they are carrying, and taking stock of the cryptic notes that you left for yourself. These things are important, to me anyway.                        </div>

Mortal Coil does the poker chips stats thing. It was one of the sexy things that made the game an easy sell.                        </div>

I just had a flashback and remembered that during our first AD&amp;D campaigns we didn't even use official character sheets!<br/><br/>It was <i>en vogue</i> to use a hand-scribbled personal version (on graph paper or similar). Neither of them were pieces of art but differently-coloured writings, doodles ("my sword looks like this"), and sketchy dungeon plans in the margins did lend a certain kind of <i>character</i> (pun intended) to the sheets that today's neatly fillid-in, sterile photoshopped and inDesignded record sheets lack.<br/>But then, there were those pioneers of the PC age who couldn't stand "imperfect", DIY sheets and used their creations of nine-needle-printed character sheets.<br/><br/>The strangest creation I saw (not in my own games, alas):<br/>A silk-screened polystyrene board (not unlike a clipboard), about 3 mm thick, laminated with an adhesive clear PVC foil, for use with overhead markers. A GM (a random encounter in a game store) made these for his whole game group (and it was mandatory that they use them).<br/><br/>Dirk                        </div>

<i>When I first started playing RPGs there were character sheets, but mostly no one used them.</i><br/><br/>That was probably true of my early D&amp;D play. But when I played RuneQuest, we made heavy use of the character sheets (especially John T. Sapienza's improved character sheets). The character sheet started to have useful game rules information on it (such as base percentages for skills, the hit location chart [with convenient locations to record hit points, armor, and damage per location], and perhaps a few other things). As the games became more complex, and we got into other players running people's PCs when they weren't there, it also became more important for character sheets to be standardized, especially when things became complex enough that the GM really did need to audit things occaisionally.<br/><br/>Of course I enjoy the strategic element that appears in these complex games, so I'm pretty well sold on some means of making that strategic element easy to track.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            I love office supplies, so I am constantly looking at them for neat new character sheet ideas.  For convention games I've often done small brochures with character statistics, story, and even pictures (if pregenerated.)  If nothing else, <b>a character sheet is a souvenir</b> of the adventure.  I was going through my dad's storeroom the other day and had some old character sheets that are (ahem!) <em>precious mementos of my gaming history</em>.  (Read, "Embarrassing examples of a six year old playing a good elf named `Rainbow Laughter,' or some such.")                        </div>

Some other games that took this approach:<br/><br/><b>Dragonstorm</b> (a CCRPG from 1996 - <a href="http://www.dragonstorm.com" rel="nofollow">here</a> can be found samples of the cards and the complete rules)<br/><b>Arcadia - The Wyld Hunt</b> and <b>Arcadia - King Ironheart's Madness</b> (the first two instalments of the Changeling CCG that could be salvaged as a pretty nifty introductory faerie tale RPG)<br/><b>Meikyu Kingdom</b> (mentioned in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1502" rel="nofollow">this thread about Japanese Madness</a>)<br/><br/>And I remember having seen (at least a year ago) a design diary of someone using the handle "Calinthera" (sp?) who worked on a design from a similar angle. (But that forum seems to have vanished.)<br/><br/>But Thomas Denmark's <b>Dungeoneer</b> is indeed the physically most stunning manifestation of a card-based RPG to date.<br/><br/>Dirk                        </div>
