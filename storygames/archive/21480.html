I\u2019m looking for somebody who\u2019ll do a professional quality job.<br/>I can\u2019t pay them money, though, so I\u2019m offering to work for them in return \u2013 I can do game-related work and/or translation work (possibly other work, too \u2013 just ask). A barter. I\u2019m asking on this forum because I expect there to be a higher ratio of people here who might value my services.<br/>Read on for the details in case you might be interested in the deal.\n<h1>My vision for a \u201clanding page\u201d</h1>\nI want a single main Internet \u201chub\u201d for people to contact me and see a list of my works.<br/>My Internet presence (as an individual, professional and as a creator of role-playing games) is scattered over a number of service providers \u2013 free or not free \u2013 such as Google Sites, Gmail, Patreon, OneBookshelf, LinkedIn, etc. This is a reality of modern life I have to accept. I\u2019m often tempted to add to that list but \u2013 unless I manually update each of the above to at least point at the new one and each other (headache inducing, ever a work in progress) \u2013 such an addition ends up further dispersing my presence. When I consider scratching something off the list or replacing one of the services (see my recent thread about Patreon) I grow anxious some people will be lost in the transition, made unable to contact me because of that one changed e-mail address or URL. Also, as someone who likes to make first contact with people in meatspace, I literally can\u2019t figure out what to print on my business card.<br/>I\u2019m thinking of getting my own domain name, then. There, people will find a simple but good-looking HTML page (clean and readable text, probably a single centerpiece picture or logo, simple layout that displays acceptably on any device and screen size, definitely no Javascript) listing basic contact info and links to any other sites and services I\u2019m using at the moment. Should I drop Patreon, resume blogging or change my email address, all I\u2019ll have to do is fix a single line in the HTML source and update the page \u2013 people I\u2019ve given my business card or who just remember my name will still know where to look for me.<br/>I said \u201ca page\u201d, but I write and work in two languages, thus I\u2019d actually like there to be two such pages \u2013 an Italian and an English one, linking to each other. Some contents might be more readable as a separate, linked page \u2013 such as a list of games, a change-log or the explanation of a long-term crowd-funding scheme: again, I\u2019d rather have two of each, in different languages, than complicate the layout.<br/>I said \u201cstatic\u201d, and I really value simplicity, but I guess a case could be made for feeds \u2013 as in the page showing snippets from the services it links to, the change-log outputting a feed to whoever might be interested, or a combination of the two \u2013 but then, perhaps not, in order to keep it quick and simple.<br/>I understand having my own domain name means paying a monthly or yearly bill for it. On the other hand, I\u2019m not worried about data storage space, as such a site needs very little in the first place and anything of meaningful size can be hosted off-site on some third party service. This is meant for indexing my stuff, not storing it.<br/>In principle, I believe all of the above is something I might teach myself how to do (I used to understand HTML, but that was in the 1990s! I expect the world has changed). However, since I only intend to do it once (plus basic upkeep) it really makes more sense for someone else to it for me \u2013 someone who already has the know-how and will find it trivial. I\u2019d rather spend my own time working at something I can already do well.<br/><br/>[continues]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470001/#Comment_470001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-14T23:18:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2018 11:18PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h1>What I\u2019m looking for</h1>\nI want somebody to:\n<ul><li>build/code and set up a website as I describe above. I\u2019ll provide the text and picture(s). Probably no more than half a dozen static HTML pages, all looking the same in terms of layout. I\u2019m hoping for clean, human-readable code.</li>\n<li>teach me how to upkeep it and alter/add/remove entries. Though no coder myself, I\u2019m in no way a desperate case, I think \u2013 as long as your HTML is reasonably plain, I should be able to work within the \u201cbox\u201d you provide. You\u2019ll also need to guide me, step by step, through the process of uploading a modified page/site.</li>\n<li>counsel me through the process of acquiring my own domain name, including perhaps recommending a cheap registrar/middleman company you\u2019ve already had a good experience with.</li></ul>\n<h1>What I can give back</h1>\nAs a wannabe \u201cartist\u201d, I am \u2013 have always been, will probably always be \u2013 in a tough spot with regards to money. I\u2019ve worked odd jobs, done freelance work on the side and am currently on unemployment benefits (that will expire in a couple months). I live in a failing economy where people are starved for jobs. My skills, expertise and web of relationships are my only real assets.<br/>My best skill-set concerns role-playing games and their design. While I can\u2019t say I\u2019m \u201csomebody\u201d in the field (in terms of AAA design credits or a successful self-publishing career) I know there are people who value my expertise. If you are in the process of designing a game, I can offer my assistance and consultancy, in-depth \u201cstudio critique\u201d of one or more drafts/prototypes, and perhaps playtesting \u2013 I do have access to a small but reliable group of friends who are quite experienced with a broad variety of story games, though I can\u2019t of course include other people\u2019s labor as a warranted part of the deal. While I\u2019m most passionate about role-playing games, I\u2019m quite knowledgeable about a wide range of other games (including but not limited to boardgames, card games and computer games).<br/>My other valuable skill-set comes from my professional experience as a translator. Should you need a text translated from English to Italian (my native language), I promise you the finest translation you might possibly get \u2013 more accurate and a better read than anything my competition can offer, and as carefully composed as to barely need proofreading. That goes for almost any kind of text \u2013 fiction, non-fiction, poetry, advertisement copy, tech manuals \u2013 short of legal prose (<i>that</i> I\u2019m not qualified for), and I\u2019m also adept at researching specialist topics for the purpose of translation. If needed I can do Italian-to-English, too, although I recommend a round of editing by a native writer (I\u2019m myself very experienced at doing such editing work on translations to Italian from any other language). I have translated audiovisuals as well.<br/>I\u2019ll produce testimonies for any and all the above skills if desired.\n<h1>Expectations of reciprocal standards</h1>\nFriendship is great! But, realistically, when volunteering any amount of work for friends or family we have to rate it as unpaid labor and downgrade our working standards accordingly \u2013 that\u2019s both reasonable and an automatism. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for in this case, though.<br/>I know that\u2019s demanding for a lot, but upon entering this agreement I\u2019m asking for the same standards of quality and to be given as much attention as a paying customer. In return, I promise to hold you in the same regard, and work as hard for you as if you\u2019d payed me in cash. If it helps cement the deal, I recommend you write down a notional bill for how much I\u2019d normally have to pay for your services, and I promise to return that much worth in labor, based on my historical pay rates. Alternatively, we can track work hours as an \u201cobjective\u201d measure of equal work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470003/#Comment_470003" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-15T00:43:01+00:00" title="February 15, 2018 12:43AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't help you myself, but I think this is a cool project, and I hope to see it succeed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470004/#Comment_470004" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-15T01:41:44+00:00" title="February 15, 2018  1:41AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2018 1:42AM by AsIf.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey <a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> - drop me a line.
