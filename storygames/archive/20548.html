In "ScenePlay" the group selects a template to follow while playing, but in practice may diverge from it as long as the key beats are hit somewhere in the proper act.  In "DayTrippers" the "vertical control" of the GM is a conscious mimicry of standard television four-act structure, and each session is designed to produce one "episode", ending with the PCs' return to Earth.<br/><br/>What are the implications?  Well, diehard storygamers report that they find such approaches overly rigid or GM-controlled, while diehard trad gamers find them overly vague or Player-controlled.  Somewhere in the middle, people find a mix of freedom and structure in it: basically we are working within a well-known narrative model and filling it with the emergent actions of the characters at the table, under the conscious facilitation of a strong GM.<br/><br/>It is a compromise, in a sense.  The key concern is the idea of the "one-shot", which was a strong design motivator for me in both cases.  Busy people, hard to get the same group together every time, etc.  This forces the designer/GM to consider models in which climax and denouement (narrative elements) are guaranteed to occur within a single session (real-world limitation).  TV episodes are a natural fit under such conditions.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451478/#Comment_451478" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T07:50:57+00:00" title="February 21, 2016  7:50AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2016 7:59AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think most GoT audiences want the <i>full</i> story to conform to a familiar arc in the end.  We're just enjoying the fact that an 8-year arc (or whatever) lends less predictability on the small scale of an episode or season.<br/><br/>The RPG parallel would be a long campaign that goes where it will before eventually arriving at a good stopping point.  I agree with Tod (AsIf) -- if you want a familiar arc in a <i>one-shot</i>, you <i>can't</i> be too hands-off about it.  A game that has some emergent features but is designed to address a particular set of issues is in-between, in my book -- 5 sessions of Sorcerer, or 10 sessions of Apocalypse World, don't feel over-scripted or minutely predictable, but they also don't have that totally emergent unpredictable directionality that sandboxy campaigns can achieve.<br/><br/>The thing that's most interesting to me is the idea of breaking the rules more fundamentally, of embracing narratives that aren't familiar on <i>any</i> scale.  <b>The RPG session as poem</b>, basically.  I don't think I've ever done this, because I've never been primed to, but I like the sound of it.  <br/><br/>I got addicted to the cartoon Adventure Time for a while specifically because of the episodes that abandoned the formula that a problem should be introduced early on and then resolved by the end.  The episodes where there maybe isn't really a problem, or there is but maybe nothing gets done about it, are among my favorites.  Stuff happens, the characters we're already invested in react to it, and then at some point we stop, and are left with new things to think about, for both the characters and the situations.<br/><br/>Kind of like that long RPG you keep coming back to every week and stopping whenever your 3 hours are up.<br/><br/>Hey, wait, I just remembered, the core Adventure Time show writers played D&amp;D together.<br/><br/>Uh... so... keep it up, non-story-gamers, your stories are my favorite?<br/><br/>"Whatever we get up to n 3 hours" isn't actually what I meant by "poem", though.  A unit of play that lacks an act structure but still functions as a unit of meaning would be sweet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451479/#Comment_451479" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T07:58:53+00:00" title="February 21, 2016  7:58AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent thoughts - what a fun thread!<br/><br/>I think it's always worth exploring how rules are broken and how that can lend unpredictability to storytelling.<br/><br/>If you consider films like "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento", you can see examples of storytelling which break expectations not (or not just!) by breaking the conventional arc of narrative, but by messing with the audience's perception of the story in presenting it in a different way.<br/><br/>Cortazar's novel "Hopscotch" is another good example: it's a novel where each chapter is numbered, but not in the right order. You have a choice when you start reading: you can open the cover and read straight through the book, or you can find the first chapter and then read <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, then <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, and so on - read them in the order they are numbered. You get a two different stories out of the same words in the same book.<br/><br/>I am often bored by media which doesn't break any rules at all - whether rules of narrative expectation (what happens when) or of dramatic delivery (what we see/read and when). Those are definitely two very interesting things to think about as a designer, I think.<br/><br/>Consider also, however, that very strong media, however exciting and novel, creates its own "rules" and expectations. (And you may find, like George Lucas, that you can create a new <i>thing</i> and have everyone tell that you didn't do it right because you <i>didn't follow the rules</i>...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine" title="Abstract_Machine"><img alt="Abstract_Machine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/129/nO5PORA7XV4QA.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine">Abstract_Machine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451480/#Comment_451480" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T08:12:36+00:00" title="February 21, 2016  8:12AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Yes, but\u2026</b><br/><br/>It sometimes seems to me that you have feint to narrative expectations in order to create the \u201cbuy-in\u201d that makes the narrative subversion meaningful to the viewers/players.<br/><br/>Cortazar\u2019s <i>Hopscotch</i>, for instance \u2013 in my opinion, a masterpiece \u2013 is one of very few 20th century novels considered successful in its narrative experimentation even by canonical (ie trad) literary critics.

"Less predictable" is exactly what sandboxy, trad-style RPG play leads to (when not railroaded, at least when not dungeon-crawly). Thus, could this be an argument for saying that sandboxy, trad-style RPGs tell "better" stories? By "better" I mean "more appealing to today's audiences", by virtue of being <i>less like</i> the stories we are used to. The mischievous implication of the OP, therefore, was that the whole idea of designing a "story game" so as to produce roleplay mimicking what happens on TV or in novels... could be self-defeating. <br/><br/>Having said that, of course, with the Forge in mind, I should acknowledge that my limited experience of playing a hack-of-a-hack-of the "play to find out what happens" game Apocalypse World left me with the impression that really it plays very much like a simplified trad RPG... yes, I had some strictly speaking metagamey choices to make (choose the "but" in your "yes, but" result), but they weren't particularly intrusive in the grand scheme of things, and really it felt very much like any old RPG. Its main virtue is simplicity. <br/><br/>I do not think that I am constantly reusing structure when I GM. At least I am not aware of doing so. Every new adventure is a new journey of discovery in scenario-prepping and in GMing. Then again once when, in a state of exhaustion and fatigue, I came up with a last-minute quickie scenario for the final session of a Con, I was accused in public feedback of pulling every tired trad trick in the book. This left me rather confused as I hadn't been aware of pulling any tricks at all. The scenario was a pretty basic one, and I may have defaulted to a very basic approach, but it was something I prepped double-quick when tired, so whaddya gonna expect.\n<blockquote>Something to look up could be Korean, Japanese, and Chinese movies.

Generally, mind you - there are always exceptions. Simply breaking the rules of storytelling doesn't make things more engaging.<br/><br/>I believe there's a "sweet spot" that's going to be a bit different for each person playing, based on their expectations and experiences. You need enough structure for familiarity and buy-in, and enough freedom and surprise for a sense of novelty and to bring 'the unexpected'.<br/><br/>An 8-yr-old kid playing an RPG for the first time will be *thrilled* and possibly <i>very</i> surprised if a typical, predictable story arc results. A long-time D&amp;D player looking for story development will often be blown away by a "traditional" conflict resolution-based Forge game from 2005. Rickard, however, finds that boring, because he's done it a bunch and he's looking for something else.<br/><br/>I think what a lot of my favourite games (and certainly AW) do well is that they focus on creating tools for the players to enact <i>change</i> in the story. Whether it's change in character, change in situations, or changes in the setting, transformation is what we measure time by, and that's extremely apparent in games which give us stories we like.<br/><br/>Dormer's comments may be applicable to television, where shows were once extremely formulaic, and now they are looking for ways to surprise the viewers.

As <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> mentions, an 8-year-old playing an RPG has a totally different experience of it than a grizzled veteran roleplayer does. Likewise it may be that to a 12-year-old many tired TV tropes (as adults might see them) seem fresh and exciting. Perhaps there is an age by which on average most members of society have "wised up" to most of the common TV tropes and the fun of them is spoilt for those individuals. Remember, though, that this is the audience's loss - if the audience is harder to please, the audience has less fun. The self-satisfaction some may take at being too "sophisticated" for certain forms of entertainment is more than matched by the resulting dissatisfaction that those who are "sophisticated" suffer with entertainment. At a more basic level, whilst I would not wish on anyone (and certainly not on myself) the brain injuries that would take away their memories of watching Friends, the fact of having those memories means I can derive only minimal enjoyment from watching a show that used to have me yearning for more.<br/><br/>Another interesting question is, if audiences <i>are</i> wising up, how has this happened now, if it didn't happen before? Is it just that we consume a lot more passive entertainment now than we used to? That may no longer be the trend, as more interactive forms of Internet-based and gaming-based entertainment (sadly, I do not mean tabletop RPGs) slowly catch up and even surpass TV/cinema as a form of entertainment. I hardly think it right to imagine that we are vastly more sophisticated on the whole than our forebears. Then again, perhaps the answer could be this:- that TV has become more and more formulaic, and since viewers have seen a more and more limited number of formulae while watching more and more TV (subject now though to the effect of the Internet and interactive entertainment), viewers have become very specialised at spotting <i>those particular formulae</i> at work.<br/><br/>Of course this is all rather speculative, without hard data.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451519/#Comment_451519" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T20:58:47+00:00" title="February 21, 2016  8:58PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was also going to bring up kishotenketsu, but, in a way, it's even more predictable; it's just a *different* formula. /.../<br/>Dormer's comments may be applicable to television, where shows were once extremely formulaic, and now they are looking for ways to surprise the viewers.

Just different formulas.<br/><br/>Even Game of Thrones is reusing the same formula, but within itself, using the same trope (killing off characters) over and over again. When does a used trope become familiar?<br/><br/>I don't know if this is too off topic, because I'm not buying the premise that roleplaying games have ever ending uncertainty, but an interesting subject came up last time at my game theory meeting.<br/><br/>A question came up about how to do if someone wanted to play their favorite TV series. A story/narrative comes in two layers, inner and outer. The outer is superficial stuff like genre, setting and stuff like that, but the inner layer is based around tropes and what they stand for. If someone wants to create the right feeling, they should look at the tropes of that series and mimic that. Even when stealing from something, all that needs to be done is to change the outer layer and keep the inner layers.<br/><br/>For example, now when killing off characters is a well-known trope in Game of Thrones, how can someone use that trope but dress it up in something else. What does the trope really stand for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451520/#Comment_451520" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T21:02:40+00:00" title="February 21, 2016  9:02PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Another interesting question is, if audiences <i>are</i> wising up, how has this happened now, if it didn't happen before?</blockquote>\nI think it was a podcast by Kevin Smith, where they talked about Daredeveil and the characters' story arcs.

The hallmark of commercial TV is the "turning point", where the situation changes and the audience asks, "Now what?"  Turning points are present in almost all narrative media of significant length, but in commercial TV you can basically cue them up before every commercial break.  <br/><br/>I think this kind of scripting culminated in "24".  24 has the most obvious and over-the-top sequence of "So NOW what?!" non-stop crises I've ever seen, scene after scene, episode after episode.  Over the course of many seasons, the show supported this frantic threat-offering by escalating how far they'd push it.  Just about every ad for the show focused on "this time there's treason!" or "this time there's torture!" or some version of "we're one-upping what we've done before!"<br/><br/>I have no idea if audiences are "wising up", but if they are, it might be because 24 and its imitators pushed the standard TV model as far as it could possibly go and now everyone's burned out on it.<br/><br/>Separately, I think Modern Family represents a new development in comedy arcs.  At some point, the show writers realized that the compelling nature of turning points and the fun of seeing the cast react to them really is the whole deal, and very little resolution is actually required.  Every episode ends with some cozy reconciliation of <i>one</i> crisis, but often the episode will have introduced 3 of them, and the audience is simply expected to not worry about what what happened with the other 2.  So the end result <i>feels</i> like a familiar arc, but two thirds of what happens in the middle is just jokes which don't contribute to that arc's plot.  When the 3 crises have anything to do with each other, it's often thematic rather than literal/causal/logistical, so I guess there's some "poetry" in that.<br/><br/>Some episodes of Louie go even farther, letting the jokes linger without <i>any</i> resolution.  I think that's more intermittent, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451522/#Comment_451522" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T22:15:37+00:00" title="February 21, 2016 10:15PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well if anyone wants to pay me to have commercial breaks in my RPG sessions I am totally up for it.
