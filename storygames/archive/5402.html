You also have to focus on the setting and background as well.<br/><br/>Frex, I totally agree with Clinton's posts above. However, if the setting is something where the players aren't encouraged to expressly work together, you could have one of those Sorcerer-style "All the PCs are stabbing each other in the FACE!!! ...in a fantasy game where they're all specialists at something or other".<br/><br/>Frex: In the console game Final Fantasy X, the background of the world was such that there were Holy Summoners, who wandered the world doing good and fighting evil monsters and corruption. Each Holy Summoner has a number of "Guardians" or companions that form a tight knit group. Thus, you have that camaraderie right from the start, with no one stealing rubies from the other, and everyone doing the Victory Dance when you defeat a sabotenda-/cactaur.<br/><br/>Sure, the leads in the game joined together to Save The World and all that, but the setting of the world already had this mechanism for heroes to join together, wander, and do good.<br/><br/>I can't think of anything quite applicable to the RPG World, save perhaps Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium. Right from the start, the game sets up the world of Cabals and Disciples: Every PC is a disciple, and 3-6 disciples form a cabal; and these cabals throw themselves at demons. And when they defeat the demons, the survivors do the Victory Dance.  In play, there is an ABSOLUTE feel of camaraderie and "we did it", with some "I RULE" (in the shit you do to defeat the demon), and that comes 70% from the game's setup and background, and maybe 30% from the fact that the rules set you up to be a member of a team, etc.<br/><br/>So maybe have the hippie rule or two, but also focus on some sort of game background that supports camaraderie and teamwork, and not interpersonal conflict and stabbing each other in the face.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121206/#Comment_121206" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T08:26:35+00:00" title="January 22, 2008  8:26AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Setting/situation point is a good one.<br/><br/>Crew of space or pirate ship, soldiers in beseiged outpost holding on for relief, explorers crossing hostile territory, landed aristocracy in time of threatened revolution and, of course, rag-tag group of civilians in midst of zombie breakout ~ any situation where collective necks are on line against a threat no one person can triumph over but which collectively can be successfuly met (if success isn't possible anyway, no reason not stab each other on the way down).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121209/#Comment_121209" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T08:35:56+00:00" title="January 22, 2008  8:35AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2008 8:38AM by Ry.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy &amp; Rob, you've given me an idea for a campaign dredging stuff up from ten years ago.

Niches, that create this sense.<br/><br/>This niches are often tied to "world effectiveness" in some way, but the real focus is often the group one.  Little Hakim the theif interacts with Joppa the archer in ways thus-and-so; Hakim's relationship to the group is "comic relief", and Joppa's relationship to the group is "taciturn mentor".<br/><br/>It strikes me that (and here, a few ripples in the ocean, but not too many), rewarding Hakim and Joppa for playing out that relationship, and having the reward itself help improve or fuel that in-world effectiveness might be a ticket to making it easy.

They are all somehow bits of a some kind of spirit dragon, that can only be brought into the world temporarily through their actions. They all have to work together for this to happen.<br/><br/>Presumably, there would be climactic points in the game where the only way to win would be to make the dragon spirit appear, manifest itself, or something similar.<br/><br/>The dragon gains power as the group gains power, and they are tied to each other--the dragon develops certain strengths and abilities as the characters do, and vice-versa. If one of the characters becomes capable of magic, or flight, the dragon gains that ability too.<br/><br/>So, the spirit creature has all the abilities of the characters. Outside the group, they are incomplete, though perhaps powerful, and can't handle all the game's challenges on their own. But, pooling their strengths together, they can bring on this dragon spirit, and, growing in strength together, overcome adversity.<br/><br/>(Also, isn't this sort of like what happens in "Power Rangers"? The individuals form together for some sort of giant battle robot? I really don't know anything about that show, as it really isn't my area of interest... except it sounded kind un-PC--the Black ranger is African American, the Yellow ranger is Asian, the Pink ranger is a girl, etc...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121244/#Comment_121244" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T10:48:58+00:00" title="January 22, 2008 10:48AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2008 10:49AM by Ry.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Also, isn't this sort of like what happens in "Power Rangers"?</blockquote>Yes, in the grand tradition of Voltron.<br/><br/>But yeah, that might make it too Saturday Morning Cartoons for my own player base (dyed in the wool weekend warriors).<br/><br/>Still, the mechanics you're talkinga bout make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121255/#Comment_121255" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T11:10:18+00:00" title="January 22, 2008 11:10AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yikes! :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121261/#Comment_121261" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T11:30:56+00:00" title="January 22, 2008 11:30AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm amenable to it being science-fiction heroes instead of fantasy ones.

Right from the start, the game sets up the world of Cabals and Disciples: Every PC is a disciple, and 3-6 disciples form a cabal; and these cabals throw themselves at demons. And when they defeat the demons, the survivors do the Victory Dance.  In play, there is an ABSOLUTE feel of camaraderie and "we did it", with some "I RULE" (in the shit you do to defeat the demon), and that comes 70% from the game's setup and background, and maybe 30% from the fact that the rules set you up to be a member of a team, etc.</blockquote>\nYou nailed it, Andy. Part of the inspiration for Dread was a disastrous D&amp;D 3E campaign, followed by a disastrous Rifts campaign, that I ran for some co-workers in 2000. Unlike my previous gaming groups, these guys completely lacked cohesion. There was no teamwork, no planning, no camaraderie, no banding together. They argued and fought and kept splitting up and making decisions that impeded other members of the group. Some of them claimed that the reason was that their characters had no reason to be friends -- so why act friendly?<br/><br/>I knew that they were off-base -- I've been playing D&amp;D for a long time, and this was the only group I'd ever seen act that way -- but I started thinking. Wouldn't it be cool if part of the mythology of your game was that you were part of a secret group? Your characters, like cops or soldiers, had this sort of grim, fatalistic brotherhood about them.
