I found managing the NPCs to be the trickiest part - especially keeping track of how close all the residents were to be killed, as they were promoted each week.<br/><br/>Here's the post where I start analysing the specific techniques I used to run it in a three hour slot.<br/><br/><a href="http://nzrag.com/bb/viewtopic.php?p=19621#19621" rel="nofollow">Here.</a> That thread also has comments from the other players, where we go into more details about some of the issues we had with the game.<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD:<br/><br/>We also had some problems justifying the use of the Leader and Pig mechanics. People were unwilling to use them - perhaps because this was such a short game, we didn't have the time to build up the tension and group bickering that would really motivate someone to become the Pig.<br/><br/>I found it extremely satisfying to keeping track of the extremely scarce resources that might help the players escape. Putting those into jeopardy through regular searches of the barracks worked pretty well as a source of tension.<br/><br/>Because I hadn't read the rules for a while before I ran it (this game was at Games on Demand), I forgot to put the Strain rules into play until we were about halfway through the session. They work really well, and started to amp up the desperation in the game.<br/><br/>There was some confusion over how (and why) to apply some of the rules for making skill rolls. After thinking about it, I reckon the most important decision that needs to be made right upfront is whether what the PC is attempting falls under the responsibility of the Leader of the group or whether it's an individual effort. <br/><br/>And a couple of times, I felt like it would be appropriate to have carry-over successes from a previous skill roll (\xe0 la Sorcerer). This struck me as especially relevant in the last scene of the game -- the escape attempt -- when the successes from a KNOW roll to break through the security fence could then have been applied to an ATHLETICS roll to resist the fence's effect.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah ... and we got a lot of black comedy out of the game. It's very bleak fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224853/#Comment_224853" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T10:29:12+00:00" title="August 15, 2009 10:29AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks alot Steve!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224881/#Comment_224881" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T17:32:53+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  5:32PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, what would you think about imposing dice limits?<br/>Something like the Pool, where the players would have a set number of dice, and when used that's it!  <br/>No more dice!<br/>I've also been thinking about using something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice)" rel="nofollow">Pig</a>.<br/>I think it's got some untapped potential...the roll again &amp; risk.<br/>It'd add a neat psychological layer to an already grisly premise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
