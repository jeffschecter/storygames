Almost 17,000 customers paid $0.01 for the game, which was the largest bar in the sales histogram (below). Closely behind, almost 16,000 purchases were between $1.00 and $1.99. A couple of spikes in the long tail occurred in the $5.00-$5.99 and $10.00-$10.99 brackets.<br/><br/>[...]Some other interesting observations included an average contribution increase over time as the sale went on. Also somewhat fascinating to note was that regular price sales through Steam (Steam) actually also rose 40% from the week before.</blockquote>\nThoughts?

I could not find development cost numbers in a cursory search (i.e. number of devs, over time, which could provide a vague estimate of cost to produce).<br/><br/>It might be a hot model for "shelving" a game, like some indie folks have done. Offer it up that product you just can't stand receiving revenue on ANY more, ONE more time, pay-what-you-want, digital distribution only (or maybe even POD PWYW, but you have to pay at least cost for the print). Go out with a bang.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25715" rel="nofollow">A little more info at Gamasutra</a><br/><br/>It would seem that the time constraint contributed a lot, though, according to the interviewee. He doesn't seem to believe it would work as a singular revenue model (i.e. released as PWYW). Then again... suppose one released as PWYW, but only release (say) 30,000 copies per time frame? It SEEMS a tad like an Auction Model, but there's no "out bidding," just a frenzy to be online and able to buy when the time frame opens up. Basically, the whole release as a sort of "Pre-Order," with PWYW hopefully driving pulses of income.<br/><br/>Hmmm.... I wish I could experiment with this some, actually. What ways would it differ from DonationWare? Something about the up-front urgency, I reckon--folks have to pay SOMETHING to get the download (even just 1\xa2--and PayPal LOVES 'em for it, I'm sure!), and they only have a small time frame, where as DonationWare can cause income to crop up even a decade later (as a buddy of mine has found with a simple applet-tool-thingie he made for Windows 98 and gave away under DonationWare).<br/><br/>Thanks for the heads-up, Daniel (shouldn't you be working on Do? <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/> ).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238398/#Comment_238398" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T12:40:35+00:00" title="October 20, 2009 12:40PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Thanks for the heads-up, Daniel (shouldn't you be working on Do? <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/> ).</blockquote>\nHow does <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docID=0ATba7Uiit9gpZGN0Njc2YzhfMTYxY2I4YmhtZ24&amp;revision=_latest" rel="nofollow">50,000 words</a> suit ya? :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238404/#Comment_238404" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T13:23:20+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  1:23PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I wonder where $100,000 (the approximate total of the above) lands with respect to reasonable / unreasonable for this sort of game.</blockquote>\nThey use the term "huge success" which would match Radiohead's and Amanda Palmer's anecdotes about "pay what you like" models. If it were a $50 game, that would be pretty poor for a large studio, and not very reasonable for a launch, but is reasonable for a year old title. I'm not sure what their regular price is ($20?) but $100,000 over the course of a week for a two person studio on a year old game is pretty solid in the "reasonable" territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238434/#Comment_238434" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T14:32:50+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  2:32PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the regular price is $10.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238449/#Comment_238449" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T15:17:20+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  3:17PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 3:25PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regular price on Steam (and according to other articles about this sale) is $20.

But like Nielsen and Arbitron, you have to pay to access the data, but the data is out there for everyone (who pays to access the data) to see, and that's been pretty common for the past century or two. So, I can tell you that sales of 57k for a week are pretty amazing, especially for a year old game. But I can't tell you how that compares to other specific titles without breaking someones rules (that, and I've been out of conventional video games for a year, so my data is at least a year old anyway).  But it is cool they are putting out this info publicly, especially as it relates to the possibility of other people doing their own small projects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238793/#Comment_238793" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T16:09:35+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  4:09PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>My favourite phrasing, and what I would use in the same situation would be "pay what you can enjoy paying."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238822/#Comment_238822" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T20:44:33+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  8:44PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2009 8:48PM by jenskot.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Their 80-90% pirate rate seems crazy at first but matching a lot of what I've seen in music.

Even if someone buys something for 1 cent, that\u2019s still valuable. You get a chance to show them that you have something valuable. They may only pay 1 cent, but time is also valuable. If they spend 1 hour playing your game, that\u2019s saying something. Maybe it\u2019s a way to prove that you can make great games and you win someone over for a future game that would have never considered playing to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, paypal takes a minimum 2.9% + $0.30 fee. And there are delivery, technical, maintenance, and customer service costs. Lets say those are just $0.10. If someone bought the game for $0.01, then the seller actually loses about $0.40 per sale. All those $0.01 sales cost them over $6,000.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich can be looked at as a marketing expense. Or is a cost to be measured against other forms of marketing and compare which have higher returns. Or compare it against selling the game for less.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at the sales chart, they\u2019ve sold around 57,076 games. Earning $126,466 before expenses. At their normal sales price of $20, they would have had to sell around 6,323 copies to make the same amount of money. Less if you consider the money they lost on selling games for $0.01. Possibly 10 times less.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don\u2019t know how many games they were selling normally. Maybe even with marketing they wouldn\u2019t have sold 6,000 copies. And this is all short term thinking, if many of those almost 17,000 people who bought the game for $0.01 are playing it, that could be huge in the long term. But if many people are downloading and not playing. Then it is less useful. Maybe having a connection to these people, being able to reach them later on is worth it alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne danger we found is that these techniques can also have long term pitfalls. The perceived value of their product can go down because people get it for less.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s likely a balancing act. Different people want to pay different amounts at different times. If you always communicate the value of something, and offer sales after the product has been out for a while and play with the sale amount, you can generate more interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the experiment, I want to see more. I\u2019d like to see the experiment done where there is a range you can pay, another time where there is just a minimum, another time you can pay what you want except you cover the transaction (paypal, service) fees, and another time where you pay what you want but get bonus content for different amounts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238835/#Comment_238835" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T04:46:05+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  4:46AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might be a nice addition to use with a webcomic model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238863/#Comment_238863" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T08:09:42+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  8:09AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Maybe even with marketing they wouldn\u2019t have sold 6,000 copies</blockquote>\nIn one week, a year after release, for an indie title?

Time and labor mainly - but also the cost of your computer and software. Since we seldom pay ourselves though and have already bought the computer the upfront cost is small. Making products on speculation though is a bigger chunk of change. POD means people largely don't have to do that. If one was using POD and the pay-what-you-want was over the production and shipping costs then that would make sense. The author has not more labor in it than already expended. <br><br>In my case this isn't so because I'm manufacturing/handcrafting my own books and board games. I need the cost of materials and a good return on my time or my motivation to labor is really low. I need more than a penny or a dollar. I want at least $10 for my hour of labor. I can make them only as I sell them so I don't need the up front costs up front. <br><br>Is the pay-what-you-want model really about profit more than cost? It only makes sense to me if it is that way. Once you start factoring in labor and what is worth people's time, prices have to be higher because there are real costs to spending time making games. I know my wife would not put up with me doing it for less than it would cost to take her out to eat now and again.<br><br>I'm looking forward to a time when I can make my game and rely on micro transactions.

And I think in that particular case the indie folks have a distinct advantage, because they can claim that creator status and cultivate the kind of relationship with their fans where they can get paid for their work.  It's why Radiohead and Amanda Palmer can get money directly from their fans even though the music industry is collapsing: they stand up and say "Hey, we want you to love this music, and we also want to be able to pay our bills and make more music; if you love it and you want us to do more, pay what you think that's worth or what you can afford."  The equation is different for that: the fans aren't buying an object, they're buying in with the artist.  And if you pirate their music anyway, well, at least you're listening...they won't give you shit about it, they'll just hope that maybe at some point in the future you'll come to a concert, buy a shirt, or think about clicking a paypal donation button and giving them your beer money, because they're cool to you and you'll feel obligated to be cool to them.<br><br>(It's also why the record companies <i>can't</i> get money directly from fans, because all they can sell is the object.  No one seems to think "If you stop buying CDs, all these people in the CD-pressing plant and the art department and especially our marketing department will need to find new jobs, oh god think of all the marketing people" is a compelling argument for getting money out of people, which is why record companies and the RIAA are just suing the fuck out of people to try and curb piracy.  There's no relationship there, there will never be a relationship there, and no one will ever think the marketing department is cool.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239373/#Comment_239373" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T05:22:31+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  5:22AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am I the only one who think that people that payed 0.01$ are assholes?

If you're going to go all "pay what you will", then it'll be good form at least to not call people assholes when they do, in fact, pay what they would. Nothing prevents the publisher using this model from asking for "pay anything over $5" if they're only going to call anybody paying under that an asshole. At least that way you don't have an invisible line of propriety for potential customers to navigate.<br><br>And yes, George is not the publisher here. But even then I think it's between the publisher deciding to sell for $0.01 and people willing to pay that - and I certainly don't think that anybody is an asshole for paying the asking price for an item. If the publisher had the aforementioned invisible line of assholitude all lined up, then he'd be the asshole, actually, claiming to be selling something for $0.01 only to turn right around and berate his customers for not reading his mind and realizing that he wanted more. I might even suggest that a third party coming in with his judgment of the transaction might be a bit assholish, considering how he's calling others assholes for taking a merchant up on his legal and (presumably) honestly presented offer.<br/><br/>I don't have a horse in this particular race, but if I ever end up using this publishing model for some reason, something along those lines will be my answer to well-meaning busybodies trying to pressure others to overpay in my campaign. I'd want to silent them quickly and definitely, you see, before they actually discourage somebody from participating because now they have this idea that they'll have to pay a certain, secret amount of money to get to be in the good guy club.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239430/#Comment_239430" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T09:18:03+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  9:18AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I strongly suspect that, at least in the music business, they're not really making their money on micropayments. There are other ways to monetize an audience; the creative content exists solely to capture eyeballs and build brand loyalty.<br/><br/>Creatives find this incredibly fucking weird -- but, perhaps, no weirder than the fact that paid subscriptions to magazines are a tiny fraction of their cash flow, with the vast majority being made via advertising and other clever schemes. Hence the reason it's trivially easy to land a free subscription to nearly anything. The difference with a magazine is that it's a lot of content by a lot of creators, editorial oversight, reputability, distribution. For music, they've got schwag, licensing agreements, ticket sales, etc.<br/><br/>What I'd love to learn more about is how startup bands get enough traction to go the pay-what-you-want route. Presumably their main cash flow is performances at first, then a tiny bit of branded schwag sold AT those performance, then a widespread distro deal that adds a 0 or two or five to the end of whatever they were making before by virtue of a much broader audience. That's just totally guesswork though.

You can't really be an asshole for doing what you were specifically invited to do.<br/><br/>I wonder, though, if some transparency in the "pay what you want" sale would have helped.  If people had known, for example, what Paypal's minimum cut of the transaction was and what percentage they were taking beyond that (perhaps with a handy "You pay X, the developers get Y" calculator app on the donation page), would the penny-spenders have kicked in more money?  I know I like to know where my money's going when I buy something, and I feel better if I think it's going to people I want to support rather than getting gobbled up by middlemen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239699/#Comment_239699" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T03:05:33+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  3:05AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2DBoy posted <a href="http://2dboy.com/2009/10/26/pay-what-you-want-birthday-sale-wrap-up/" rel="nofollow">Pay-What-You-Want Birthday Sale Wrap-up</a>, with more figures from the end of the second week of their sale.<br/><br/>Apparently the average amount paid went up in the second week.

Now, before folks just say, "well, that's MSRP," consider other "pay at least" businesses, i.e. almost anything involving an opportunity to tip. Pay MSRP at a bar for each drink and see how long you wait for your third or fourth; conversely, tip in the 25%-30% range and see if you even HAVE to wait for a refill. Back when I got haircuts, I routinely tipped something around $5 (on $10 wet cut--not a stylist, folks!), and I feel that I eventually enjoyed shorter waits and Oz took more time to make sure he dealt with the weird cowlicks on my crown.<br/><br/>But that starts to sound more like the "premium" model: everyone gets FOO for the MSRP, but you get a little extra something if you bump up to the "premium" price. And this is basically what the free MMOs do--I've just gone back to D&amp;D Online... and there's a fair chance they'll siphon another $15 or so out of me, if I decide I really MUST play a monk to level 20. And even if only 5-10% of us do that, consider how that compares to the income for a title that was basically in decline (server merges, etc). And we also (BONUS!) have a major publisher who's going to test-drive the notion of new, premium content--not much different from the speculative production we must do to develop and release a game as PDF. If they can "sell modules"--even better, sell them to all six players in them at a time!--then that's a strong data point for some of last week's ideas about periodic content drops to drive sales of other, related (or orthogonal) for-profit products (merch, the main game system, etc).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
