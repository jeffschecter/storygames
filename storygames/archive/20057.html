It's one I'm very keen to attend, as a sizeable chunk of my storygaming/Nordic larping homies will be there, including many luminaries from that scene. Trouble is, I'm very short of funds atm, so I'm thinking of producing a set of custom dice to finance my trip. The dice will be manufactured in the indyhippo company colours, to whit grey with pink spots (there's a reason for that particular colour scheme which I won't go into here, unless folks ask), and I\u2019ll probably sell them in sets of 20 for \xa35. Does that sound reasonable? I\u2019ll need to sell around 60 sets of 20 dice, which seems quite ambitious, but I\u2019m hoping it will be achievable.<br/><br/>Can folks signal interest here so I can get a sense of likely numbers, and whether it\u2019s doing at all?<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Leo                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443521/#Comment_443521" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-01T20:25:34+00:00" title="March  1, 2015  8:25PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does [it] sound reasonable?</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443582/#Comment_443582" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T00:20:01+00:00" title="March  3, 2015 12:20AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe people have enough dice already?<br/><br/>By the way, I'd gladly help you out if I could (as usual, I exhausted whatever little money I had paying for my own trip to Knudepunkt). Maybe some segments of the roleplaying world (including me, in principle, weren't I currently broke) would be more inclined to just help fund your journey than to buy even more dice?

And I'm even less of a known figure than Avery. So I doubt that would work. <br/><br/>As to folks having enough dice already, you should see some of the tables I play at groaning under the weight of several tons of moulded plastic as players empty their dice bags on them at the start of the session.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, if I can't go I can't go, but it won't be for want of trying. Anyway, thanks for your input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443626/#Comment_443626" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T21:14:06+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  9:14PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>'Why should I pay for her\xa0holiday?'</blockquote>\nEh, I know.
