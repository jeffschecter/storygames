It was a surprise when our GM didn't show up, but an even bigger one when the creator of the game revealed himself at the table to step in to run it! We had a good time, all the while eating ice cream that Carl Rigney brought for everyone.<br/><br/>After that, I was on the waiting list to play Grey Ranks (Macklin was running it) but everyone showed up for that one. So the staff was kind enough to let my friend and I play Pandemic on one of the unused table. He was super excited about his just-bought copy and had been talking about the game for weeks. It wasn't my first minicon, but it was his and for the 10AM slot, he played <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i>. He said he had a really great time, and their game involved time travel, cthulhuesque weirdness, and gods...? I'm not sure, but afterwards we were talking about how that story could only have been told with that game, and not with any other media.<br/><br/>For the 8PM slot, I ran <i>Serial Homicide Unit</i>. I had four people besides myself, granted that 3 of them were friends who came to play with me. This was my second time with the game, and this time, I only facilitated it, as having 5 civilians would have pushed us for time. They ended up catching the serial killer, but not before 2 of the "former olympians" had been slain. Germany, infidelity, meth lab explosions, mob-backed gyms, and eating disorders were all there. At times it felt like what I'd imagine a game of Fiasco to be like. It was a blast, and I was only helping with the rules and being the audience!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265595/#Comment_265595" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T10:04:27+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:04AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'd love to learn how it is organized and run.

Game sign ups are done by email on a first come first served basis.  The store has a great play area they use for the con.  They real magic behind the Endgame minicons seems to be the community of gamers the store has built up.  I drive up from L.A. and it's absolutely worth the trip, nut just because I get to play in some great games, but but I get to hang out with a great group of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265599/#Comment_265599" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T10:26:34+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:26AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to add to the nice sum-up that Will gave, EndGame's setup does seem pretty simple. But Chris Hanrahan has (mastered?) this over the course of 4+ years and probably 15+ minicons. Some of these things may be difficult for many game stores because of size, location, or whatnot:<br/><br/>-They have a place to play that can support up to 8-9 games at once (although the noise gets challenging above 7 games) and maybe 30-50 players at once.<br/>-They charge each player $3 per game to play. This is given back to the GMs in the form of $5 in store credit for each game they run, plus free snacks and drinks while they are GMing.<br/>-Despite Carl's best efforts at bribing us with good ice cream, they don't have to deal with meals as they give one hour lunch and dinner breaks and there are places w/i walking distance.<br/>-They encourage indie and story based games, which I think makes it a destination for people like Will and Paul who came up from LA (thanks guys!). And not just for the gamers in a 30-mile radius.<br/>-And yeah, it's a good group of gamers and GMs. Many of whom come back again and again. I've probably GMd games at half the minicons and never had a bad experience running anything. There's little to no drama (that is apparent to the customers) around getting players or getting into a game. If a GM doesn't show up or someone needs a game, the staff walks around asking which GMs can take extra players. But there's a lot of planning and emailing back and forth that the staff does to set these up.<br/><br/>I like that Chris H. comes up and talks to everyone before each of the slots starts. He thanks everyone for coming out, calls out any special guests and pimps any new games that local folks are bringing out. And I hope he sells a crapton on product on those days. I do know that he got something like nine pre-orders for Dresden Files and I heard he moved 3-4 copies of Fiasco that day.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's a totally different vibe from a (similar sized) con like GPNW which has become very designer and experimental focused. John Harper can write a game and bring it to GPNW to get playtested six different times because he's not trying to sell it. As a store owner, obviously Chris H. needs to sell games to stay in business and so we play games that are in print at the minicons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265665/#Comment_265665" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T14:43:49+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  2:43PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 2:47PM by ccreitz.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>He said he had a really great time, and their game involved time travel, cthulhuesque weirdness, and gods...?

Previously, I'd only seen the Lovecraft-flavored setting for <i>Penny</i> yield cultists and victims, but by the time everyone's second scene rolled around, that was straight out the window, and it turned out that we were gods/monsters, except for Morgan's magical time traveler. It's the kind of traumatic revelation that might cost you your memory, one supposes.<br/><br/>At the beginning, we had a chat about the issues that tend to come up in <i>Penny</i>, taking a little time in particular to discuss whether we wanted to try and limit the gonzometer to the green part on the left of the dial. The consensus was that we were cool with pinning the needle if that was where the fiction took us. Just to be safe, when I was being asked for guidance, I offered relatively tame alternatives so that if anyone felt like things were getting out of hand, there would be an outlet. Needless to say, that meant I went last with the fewest coins possible, which did not bother me one little bit. I chose the themed playset more or less to give us permission to go over the top, and, indeed, that's what ended up happening. We were in therapy with Cthulhu and that was pretty sweet!<br/><br/>I do have to say that over the years, protagonists in my Cthulhu games have done a lot of great things to push back the darkness for one more day. On Saturday, I got a taste of that (no pun intended) when I got one story out of the kitchen where the human(?)-flesh nachos were otherwise waiting to be eaten. Never have I been prouder of my contribution to the cosmic struggle, futile though I know it to be.<br/><br/>Thanks to Morgan, Brady, and Jeremy for a really enjoyable game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265716/#Comment_265716" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T23:35:19+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 11:35PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I couldn't make this last minicon but I'll say this - the regional cons (DunDraCon, KhublaCon, et al) may be big events, but I get more quality game time at the Endgame minicons than I ever do at the bigger cons. Plus the community of gamers that attend the minicons is top notch. Chris H. has utilized the assets he has well and is able to do these 3 or 4 times a year now. <br/><br/>It's all part of the reason why Endgame rocks so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Penn42" title="Penn42"><img alt="Penn42" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Penn42">Penn42</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265776/#Comment_265776" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T10:10:01+00:00" title="April  6, 2010 10:10AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the love everyone.<br/><br/>To speak directly to Jason's question, from my perspective, this was pretty much the most successful MiniCon we have had yet. We fired off 21 individual games over the three time slots, and pretty much found the spot where we are at capacity for these things. We took 12 pre-orders for The Dresden Files RPG (both volumes) and moved a ton of other games as well. We had a fantastic crew of GMs, and a wonderful group of players. Everyone seemed happy. <br/><br/>Mr. B pretty much laid it all out pretty well up above. We have been doing this long enough where I have the process pretty nailed down. With that said, it gets fairly time intensive. I have spent some time looking for automated tools to speed it up some, but so far, nothing has been as flexible as just doing it myself. It's a very hands on process to collect all the games, then get all the players attached to them. it becomes even more labor intensive when we lose a GM, or players want to swap games. If there are any stores, or venues that want to replicate what we do, I would be happy to help...with the warning that you will just need to spend some time in front of your computer, and stay on the ball. The real key is to be flexible as the event happens.<br/><br/>Anywho, glad to see everyone had fun, and I am looking forward to the Good Omens MiniCon on 7/17!<br/><br/>Chris H.<br/>EndGame                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266264/#Comment_266264" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T02:48:03+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  2:48AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2010 2:50AM by Carl.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The quarterly <a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com/" rel="nofollow">Endgame</a> minicons are always a good time.  Bennett covered most of the organizational details above.  21 games were run in total, with typically 3-6 players each.<br/><br/>I had a great time running <em>Don't Rest Your Head</em> "Minority Book Report" in the morning slot, in which the PCs went into the Library of No Returns in the Mad City, found The Book That Lists All Deaths, did a little editing, and returned it to its proper owner.  In the process one PC gave up her feelings for her parents, and one PC returned the daughter of another PC who had given her up 15 years ago.<br/><br/>In the afternoon slot 4 of us played <em>Fiasco</em> for the first time, me teaching, using the LUCKY STRIKE playset posted two days previously, set in a WW II replacement depot camp in France in November 1944.  It turns out that hiding the black market drugs next to the stolen cognac in the ammo dump is not as good a plan as it seemed at the time.  My junkie from Kansas and the pimping thieving head nurse got happy endings (separately); the smart and brave privates came to bad ends. It was a lot of fun!<br/><br/>Evil Hat and Endgame arranged that people pre-ordering both books of the Dresden Files RPG got a CD with a preview PDF on it, and Chris was showing off the shiny new game on his shiny new iPad.<br/><br/>Mike Montesa was busy at Wondercon but Chris H made sure to mention to all 3 timeslots that his game "Wierd War II" for Savage Worlds had been nominated for an Origins Award.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://www.jenisicecreams.com/" rel="nofollow">Jeni's Ice Cream</a> isn't a regular feature, it was just because the minicon was held on Kristin's birthday (of <a href="http://www.thismoderndeath.com/" rel="nofollow">This Modern Death podcast</a>). There were also cookies, and a storewide singing of "Happy Birthday".  Three times.<br/><br/>I had a great time, and I'm already looking forward to the Good Omens Minicon on 7/17.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
