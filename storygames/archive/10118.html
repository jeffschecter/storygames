So we're re-launching.<br/><br/>What I'd love to do is hand out some free copies of the print edition at GenCon. Unfortunately, I can't be there. So instead we're giving away the PDF until the end of GenCon. Anyone who gets the PDF can get the print edition for $11 (nearly \xa38) off the normal price. This offer's only on over GenCon, in place of me being there.<br/><br/>I've done my best to get some proper support online, as opposed to how the original release happened. <a href="http://www.zeropointinformation.com/aeternal/" rel="nofollow">My site</a> has an introductory character pack and introductory adventure, and links to both the <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13585.phtml" rel="nofollow">two</a> <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13578.phtml" rel="nofollow">reviews</a> on RPG.net and a <a href="http://www.zeropointinformation.com/aeternal/reviews.html" rel="nofollow">collection of things people have said</a> about the game. I've been opening up the design process over on <a href="http://www.mobunited.com/mobunitedmedia/tag/aeternal-legends/" rel="nofollow">mobunited.com</a>, in preparation for the release of the game's second supplement.<br/><br/>I've learned a lot from the first launch and what came after. What I'm currently having a hard time getting straight is what level of online support people want/expect when getting into a new game. So I put it to you: what would you like to see, and what do you expect?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
