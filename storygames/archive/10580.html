In the end, no one will find you wrong for doing so, certainly not the people you bought the PDF from).<br/><br/>However, as most of us agree, this law is stupid and you can break it with a clear moral conscience. Do it while carrying a copy of Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". You asked for morality, and not the law: I say that it's morally fine.<br/><br/>Here's some interesting questions/concerns that I have:<br/><br/>1) Question: You are clearly allowed (by author/publisher) to replicate materials like character sheets "for personal use". They won't have a problem with you printing a copy at Lulu and shipping a copy to yourself. But how about buying one copy of a PDF, and printing out 4 copies at Lulu/other for the members of your gaming group? Law aside (no interest in this discussion), what do you think of the moral implication of that action? Just curious (because it's something I waffle on as well)<br/><br/>2) Vignette: My friend published a gorgeous full-color RPG, and also sells an inexpensive PDF version. He sometimes gets complaints (? actually, more like suggestions) from users saying "it's hard to print out the pages because of all the ink used, can you make a less-colored/less-print-intensive version?", to which his reply is "...how about just buying the [damn] book instead?"* I laughed at this response, because it's totally true. <br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* He offers a discount to people who buy the PDF then later want the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234687/#Comment_234687" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T09:06:54+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  9:06AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I didn't know you could send a PDF to Lulu you didn't buy <i>from </i>Lulu and have it printed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bevedog" title="bevedog"><img alt="bevedog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stevelawson.name/icons/steve-in-3D-32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bevedog">bevedog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234688/#Comment_234688" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T09:08:06+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  9:08AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>As JD mentioned, it's currently "against the laaaaw" (say in your best Sylvester Stallone "Judge Dredd" voice), which is why the printer (Lulu, local, etc; I've seen this at local printers as well) require you to sign (digitally) that you own the rights to replicate the document.</blockquote>\nI think there is no possible way in which JD is right about this.

I mean, if that's the case, buy the print product, y'know?  I do think sometimes people buy cheaper PDFs when they don't want to commit to a game in print yet.  Like, okay, I can pay $10 for this just to see how it is.  But sometimes you subsequently really like something and find it way easier to have a print copy on hand in play.  For example, I think I still only have an electronic copy of Dogs in the Vineyard, which seems a bit ludicrous considering how much I've run / played the game.  But I would never consider printing and binding Dogs, rather than buying a print version from Vincent, just to save a few bucks.

This all assumes, of course, that it's not a free PDF, in which case you can usually do all that... but not SELL copies to your friends, only give away or sell at cost of printing. Seems pretty straight-forward to me; what's your source of wafflage? The notion that "well, we COULD all play with one book, but it's EASIER if everyone gets a copy" logic (which I find unsound off the bat: the ease of use is a convenience for which you pay when you buy four copies for your friends)?<br/><br/>That said, let's dial it up another notch: you take the PDF and GIMP and make "cheat sheets" to print out for your friends to use as reference... and which, basically, have all the book's contents that one might need after one reading (i.e. the game is easy to recall procedurally, you just need occasional look-ups of stats or values). That will have the same net effect as printing out copies for everyone, but at a fraction of the cost and waste (of paper that is never referenced; e.g. fictional examples). In order to "do right" by the game maker, you'd have to "do wrong" by the trees of the world.

I wag my finger at you.</blockquote>\nWhy? Generally speaking, the reason the PDF is cheaper is that you're paying the author for content and layout <i>only</i>, while assuming the monetary burden of printing yourself... <b>Not </b>because the author is selling the PDFs at a loss, or giving them away as a preview of the print book.<br/><br/>If an author/publisher releases a PDF of a book as an <i>option </i>for potential buyers, customers are supposed to choose whichever option is best for them - usually going for the <i>overall </i>cheaper option. If lived in the USA, or otherwise I had a shop close to me where they carry the RPGs I want, or if shipping was fast and free, I'd be happy to buy printed books. Instead, I buy the PDFs and print me, which probably costs me a little more than a US customer would pay for a print book (after you account for ink, paper, power, and time spent binding the pages together), but less than buying a physical book and having it shipped from overseas. Sure, I also end up with a less attractive item in my hands (and not very durable, so you have to account for printing a replacement copy at times), <b>but </b>I can satiate my thirst for reading the content almost immediately as opposite to waiting one month ore more (plus the very concrete possibility of having a damaged book delivered, or having to pay an extra for the Italian customs, or the package actually getting lost).<br/>If I could just walk to a shop in my neighborhood and get a print copy of IaWA or Grey Ranks for 20 bucks, instead of downloading the same for 10 bucks and printing it myself, I'd happily go with the former.<br/><br/>The case in question, where the PDF sells for $5 and the book for $50, is weird. The numbers seem to indicate that the author extimated the cover price of the book as being 1/10 content, 9/10 physical item. Maybe the book has superb production values, thus by just printing out the PDF you get an inferior product?

I think John Wick was smart on this one. He has a fat game that he's selling for $50-ish. So he hooks people in by giving you the total package in a PDF for $5. It totally hooked me in. Then he can possibly get more sales on the book from people who like the game they see in the PDF and say, "I only spent $5 on it. I'll just get the book, too."

I wag my finger at you.</blockquote>As somebody who regularly does this, a few reasons:<br/><br/>1. I'm Austrian, so if I'm ordering indie books shipping fees regularly rape my wallet. I don't mind paying for pretty books but I prefer my wallet unraped.<br/>2. There is a psychological difference between a book I printed/bound myself and a book that was printed professionally. There is the enjoyable DIY aspect, which feels nice. There is the fact that it looks kinda cheap and bad, which is good because it helps me get over my "OMGBOOKSMUSTBEKEPTWELLANDNEVERBEDEFACED" reflex, allowing me to use it in ways I wouldn't use a "propper book". (Write in it, lend it to people with tendency to spill things on it).<br/>3. Books I printed out are replacable. If there is a coke-at-the-table accident, I can just throw it away in the worst case and print out a new one. With a printed book I'd probably have to pay the price for two books, with shipping and all, to replace one copy.<br/>4. With a book I print out, I can be the EDITOR. I can only print out selected pages, reorder them, ignore stupid chapters and so on. This is not possible, barring bookbinding experience and some heart-breaking book-killing, to do with a "propper book".<br/><br/>I still buy real books from the publisher, when I see them at the FLGS. Sometimes, I even order them. Even so, I often also get the pdf version so I can print a "working copy". Books printed by the publisher and books printed by myself are not interchangable or equal, they do different things and have different advantages. Assuming that somebody wants to print out the book only because they REALLY want to proper book for cheaper is ... weird, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234839/#Comment_234839" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T07:23:31+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  7:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>1) Question: You are clearly allowed (by author/publisher) to replicate materials like character sheets "for personal use".

If the designer never intended for it to be printed, why would he put in such an easy to print size (8.5 x 11). I purchased a copy of Mechaton (Vincent Baker's Lego war game) and printed it out, then punched 3 holes in each page and put it in a 3-ring binder. I don't recall if he even offers a bound copy of the game, but that is besides the point. Is what I did morally dubious? I had no intention of buying a book version because I find it easier to store PDFs than books (plus as an English grad student, I have plenty of books).<br/><br/>Even if there is a printed version and a PDF version of something, ask yourself why this need for the printed version? Easier to read? You like owning books of your games? If I sold a PDF to someone, I'd tell them to print it and bind it however they want (without breaking copyright laws). Once you pay for the PDF, have fun with it. Our transaction is over so why should I tell you what to do with the product? If someone bought my PDF to then bound 1000 copies and sell it, then we have problems because now you are violating my rights as the creator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235886/#Comment_235886" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T09:48:25+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  9:48AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't mind if people print the PDF of my game(s).

Of course, this is now the digital era and digital printers don't need to rip files or create printing plates in order to print something. Our printer can tackle CYMK and RGB files equally well. But the evolution of the PDF, with its embedded fonts and all, remains a neutral and "standard" way to transmit a file for printing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEqually important, the majority of publishers selling content on PDF have some expectation that the items will be printed by the end user. This is especially true of games, where charts, important rules or whole books will be printed for reference in game use. Plus lets not forget PDF game tiles, 3d card stock build-it-yourself kits, strategy bard and wargame maps and counters, PDF card games, etc. PDF is a file format intended for print and the majority of PDF game releases are intended for print. Heck, some publishers even bundle ink friendly versions of their PDFs specifically to save their customers money in printing the items.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, it is copyright protected material. The owner, by industry standard, has an implied right to print their own PDF for their own personal use. This is no way extends their right to distribute said goods to any 3rd party. So printing it and giving it to your friends becomes a no no.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it gets stickier with regards to rights of transfer of physical goods. Something you typically always have the right to do. So technically, if you bought a PDF, you have a right to use it. If you give your legally purchased PDF to a friend, it would be considered duplication and distribution, which you don't have a right to do, unless perhaps if in giving it to them, you deleted all copies of the thing yourself. That _MIGHT_ still be ok under traditional rights of transfer, but I am unaware of any case precident clarifying that issue. Likewise, if you print your PDF, then give it to someone else, so long as you delete the PDF itself and don't keep any printed copies to boot, then that in theory is ok too under your right of transfer. In theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the issue of having a third party printer print it. In you have the right to print it, you have a right to have a 3rd party print it for you. This, of course, runs into the issue of distribution. You must obviously give a copy of the file to said 3rd party in order for them to print it. Additionally, that third party, having no rights to the copyright also has no rights to make any alterations or ammendments to it and can only print those portions you tell them to. Ala, you can tell them to print only certain pages, only the front cover, print it in color or B&amp;W, but you can't ask them to edit the text, change or alter any graphics, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we do print and bind PDFs as a professional service here in our store, this is how we approach it.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) You must show evidence of proper ownership or right to duplicate. This can be you being the owner of the copyright, you showing us proof of purchase, etc. For proof of purchase, we require any of a reciept, each page being properly watermarked by the seller and that matching the name of the would be print customer giving us the PDF, or showing proof of the PDF being freely distributed by the appropriate rights holder. On a couple occasions we've had folks come in and tell us they got permission from the publisher directly to duplicate and even make alternations to the original PDF and before we could do the job, we have e-mailed or called the publisher to get confirmation of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) You will sign a document declaring both your right to duplicate and clarify its intended usage. Right to duplicate does not equal right to sell and/or distribute. And even though if they have the right to duplicate it, we should be clear to print it, we want no part of printing it if they plan to then go on ti illegally sell or distribute it.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Once we have the PDF, we check the first few pages to make sure the PDF did not come with some sort of restrictive license. i,e, declaring that the purchaser/owner of the PDF does not have duplication rights, can only duplicate it on saturdays, can only duplicate it in a domicile you own and only at a rate of one printed page per week, etc. Theory says, the owner of the copyright can clarify what duplication and/or distribution rights the purchaser of the PDF has and can apply any limits they so wish, excepting the usual (age, race, gender, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Once printed, we delete the file. Obviously in order to print it, we must have access to it. This is the one real grey area, since them giving it to us could in theory be considered distribution. But if it is simply for us to perform a service for duplication that they have a right to have done, then the distributed copy is deleted, then the arguement is that is was not distributed (since there was no intent to transfer ownership). This too is an area where there seems to be no case precident yet. We have proceeded on the principle that a right to duplicate and a right to have that duplication outsourced is no right at all if technical limitations make it so the 3rd party can not access the document necessary to provide that service and within that conflict, if reasonable action is taken to protect the IP holder in the doing of the service for which the owner has a right to utilize, then that should prove acceptable under the law. Logic doesn't always win court cases, but when encountered by a zone undefined by law, its a good place to plant yourself on the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so that all being said. Any publisher here that doesn't want the customers who purchase their PDFs to have a right to duplicate, to be on the safe side, on the copyright page of that document, I would clarify any restriction on the right to duplicate that the customer will have. I would make sure that such a restriction is legal and I would make sure that said restriction is made known to the purchaser before they purchase. That would be the "safe" place to be on the issue, should you want to implement any kind of restrictive use license on your PDFs. At least until such a time any "defaults" are clarified under the law, you have a right to remove any potential ambiguity on rights to your IPs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

The fact that my PDF reader software has "Print" built into the file menu seems to contradict that, doesn't it?  I've certainly seen software that doesn't have a "Print" option built in, so it seems like printing is an explicit function of PDF reader software to me.<br/><br/>My group is getting ready to play <i>Spirit of the Century</i> with one copy of the book and sharing the PDF around.  I'm 99% sure I remember hearing an interview on some Podcast (possibly even the official Evil Hat podcast, the name of which escapes me for the moment) where Fred Hicks said that such a situation would be cool with him.  Certainly, I hope that, if we like the game and keep playing it, more of our group will buy the book.  I think that's the ideal way for PDFs to work.  Sharing one book between a group of, say, six gamers, is lame, but expecting a group to buy six copies of a book every time they start a new game is kinda lame, too, IMO.  The PDF seems to solve this problem nicely.  If the group is ethical, though, and they continue to play the game, I think, more, if not all, should buy the book, or at least pay for their own PDFs.  Does that make sense?
