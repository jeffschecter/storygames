Unfortunately, the game's mechanical presentation is mired in, well, GURPS. My forays into indie-gaming have convinced me that I needn't suffer through an hours-long process of character creation just to have a decent sense of character, so I'm on the hunt for something portable/hackable that could scratch my Transhuman Space itch.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record: I am looking for a way to play a Science Fiction roleplay game focused on the transformation and redefinition of humanity and the colonization of the solar system. I've played Shock: to great effect, but I found the play-style too sweeping in outcomes and aggressively focused on themes. I haven't read it, but I have a sense that Microscope would hit a similar "too epic for my purposes" spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for a close, character-driven drama set against a backdrop of - and in dialogue with - a gritty, sometimes mundane, and always unforgiving universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if anyone has any ideas (or just wants to say, "hey, yeah Transhuman Space was way cool!"), Please do!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Zach<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.-wooo first post!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332097/#Comment_332097" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T12:53:55+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 12:53PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fucking loved Transhuman Space.<br/><br/>Shock and Microscope are about world-building more than playing in an established world, so it might not fit your groove for THS.<br/><br/>I played a Fate game of it once, and you could probably do it with Diaspora.

It's very flexible and gets you focused on the character drama in a very nice way. Eero Tuovinen's booklet (Solar System) is really, really good.<br/><br/>If it's more of a dark, gritty, tragic rendering, I have designed a game called "Land of Nodd". You won't find too much discussion of the game anywhere, but I'm working on updating the text and could send you a copy. I think it handles this kind of thing really well: exploring a mysterious larger world from a limited perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan" title="Zachary_Donovan"><img alt="Zachary_Donovan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan">Zachary_Donovan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332106/#Comment_332106" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T13:24:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  1:24PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Nathan<br/>\n<br/>\nIn no particular order:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I would like a positive feedback loop between the mechanical implementation of conflict resolution and character representation, and the themes and fiction of the game. GURPS is a generic system, and thus does not have tools (of which I am aware) for fostering/encouraging/inspiring thematically appropriate play.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) GURPS anticipates that a GM will prep "an adventure." To quote from the copy of GURPS LITE included in the back of Transhuman Space, specifically the section on running the game:<br/>\n<br/>\n"The GM shoud determine a way to motivate and involve the PCs (e.g., a rich or interesting person hires them to solve a problem). Make notes (or diagrams) to help describe events or locations that adventurers may encounter, create a few interesting NPCs the PCs may interact with, and devise challenges or obstacles that require wit, negotiation, skill use or combat to overcome!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the entirety of the advice on game-mastering GURPS.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I am less than interested in making sure that every single detail of a character or situation is established in advance. My style of play runs to the improvisational.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) I don't have any beef with GURPS per se, I just find it a little uninspiring.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Ryan<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll investigate Smallville and Primetime Adventures - is Smallville intended for episodic play? Not that I've made my mind up either way, just gathering information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332110/#Comment_332110" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T13:36:54+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  1:36PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zachary, what do you want your story(ies) to be about?<br/>Answer that question, then find a game that does that best.<br/>There's a bunch of games that probably fit the bill, some would need alot of adjusting(Smallville I'm lookin' at you!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332113/#Comment_332113" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T13:53:11+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  1:53PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several years back I ran a great THS game in Earth orbit using the Heroquest rules.

However, I don't think the game is geared towards fighting/combat necessarily.  The space battle mini-game rewards fast ships and fleeing.  Damage can be horrific whether to your ship or person.  <br/><br/>Judd ran a Diaspora game where his players were basically running the East India Trading Company in space.  <br/><br/>Our game was basically the Holy Roman Empire in space, with a new world being discovered that held ancient relics of an advanced civilization.  The players smuggled the cargo by running blockades and seeking falsified security clearance.  Lot of seedy locations and brokering of deals.    <br/><br/>There's definitely combat in Diaspora, but I would say there's about as much combat as in Burning Wheel or The Mountain Witch.  It depends what you want to do with it.  By the same token, our PTA series had just as many bloody shootouts per session as our Diaspora campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332124/#Comment_332124" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T14:52:57+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  2:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2011 2:54PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zachary,<br/><br/>My game does a very specific thing, which you may like or not like!<br/><br/>Here's what I say in the text:\n<blockquote><br/><i>Land of Nodd</i> is a pen-and-paper roleplaying game in which players take on the roles of characters pursuing independent plotlines. As the game progresses, these plotlines reveal unexpected connections and converge to form a larger overall narrative. Stories told through the <i>Land of Nodd</i> tend to be twisted and mysterious, full of conspiracies and strange coincidences.<br/><br/>Its design was inspired by novels and films like <i>Cryptonomicon</i>, <i>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</i>, <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, or the fantasy novels of Steven Erikson.

To me, the "verb" isn't "transcend" or "evolve" or "adapt". It's "impose". <br/><br/>Transhumanism is essentially the culmination of humanity's attempts to dominate nature. When you live in a world where you (and everyone else) can alter your body easily (or move between bodies, or into computers, or whatever), you've <i>already succeeded</i> at "transcend" and "evolve". The important thing becomes how and where you can impose your will. On environments. On culture. On other people. On thought itself. When everyone can alter reality to suit their mood, the contest is to see who can best impose their vision.<br/><br/>Anyway, a question for the original poster: what do you think of the <i>setting</i> of <a href="http://www.eclipsephase.com/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse Phase</a>? I'm guessing you won't like the mechanics, but how does the setting succeed or fail for what you are trying to do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332255/#Comment_332255" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T10:35:05+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 10:35AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zachary Donovan</cite>I've played Shock: to great effect, but I found the play-style too sweeping in outcomes and aggressively focused on themes.</blockquote>\nZachary,<br/><br/>I know you've already addressed <i>Shock:</i>, but may I recommend <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/shockhuman-contact/" rel="nofollow"><i>Shock: Human Contact</i></a>?

What's the scoop?</blockquote>\nHeh, looks like you got plenty of info, but I'll give you a short summary.<br/><br/>Traveller is a generic system that's made to play Space Opera type games. So it's real easy to take it and add systems on to it (beliefs and instincts, change the setting around, add social conflict that makes more sense) or just use it as it is. It's 2d6 + your stats to succeed on a roll. I like Traveller for our Halo game. It's really simple to use, and because of that we can easily change it to fit our setting (which might be good for you because the setting you're talking about isn't one that's represented specifically in any of these games).<br/><br/>I would also back up the suggestions of Freemarket (cause its awesome, although it probably won't fit your setting needs it'll fit your character development and drama needs) and Shock: Human contact from what I've read about it seems to fit your exploring cold space theme, and Dispora I've heard has an excellent "solar system" generator that helps you create planets and threats and species that live there and really flesh them out for cool in game play, though it seems to be really heavy on Fate rules like Dresden. Maybe you can pick and choose the parts you like and piece them together!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
