<p>So, I've mentioned twice now my thoughts on a medical drama RPG that assembles situations out of two halves, Click and Lock-style:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>what if you combine "medical condition" and "personal situation" halves to create a conflict for a Medical Center/St. Elsewhere-style game?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>(see <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2242&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> for source.)</p>
<p>Here's a fuller explanation, and a call for help: I'm seeing medical drama situations as being built out of two components: a medical condition, which is highly generic, and a personal complication. I'm talking in terms of tropes repeated in multiple medical dramas, rather than completely accurate medical conditions, so this basic structure could be applied to a broad range of settings, from <em>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</em> through the Korean War (<em>MASH</em>) to a hypothetical Space Doctor drama. Examples of medical condition tropes would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>outbreak</strong>: several people contract a threatening illness; in addition to treatment, doctors need to discover the source.</li>
<li><strong>emergency</strong>: threatening illness or injury, but complete recovery is expected, if treated in time.</li>
<li><strong>fatal condition</strong>: no recovery possible, but doctors can help patient cope with pain or grief.</li>
<li><strong>stigma</strong>: complications if untreated, may or may not be chronic, but merely having condition affects a patient's social situation.</li>
<li><strong>loss of function</strong>: treatment eliminates any health threat, but patient must cope with loss.</li>
<li><strong>chronic condition</strong>: fatal only if untreated, but patient may have trouble coping even if able to return to a normal life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of personal complication tropes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>phobia</strong>: someone won't enter hospital or otherwise receive/assist treatment because of fear.</li>
<li><strong>taboo</strong>: someone objects on religious or ideological grounds to a procedure.</li>
<li><strong>prejudice</strong>: someone won't receive or assist treatment because of irrational dislike.</li>
<li><strong>alienation</strong>: someone can't cope because they feel cut off from emotional support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, each of these tropes needs to be fleshed out with two to four features, like "needs emotional support" for "fatal condition", which would be blocked by something in a personal complication (example: father and son won't talk, even though father is dying.) The idea is that you can mix and match the two halves to create a complete situation, which the doctors (PCs) would try to resolve. The situation can be further complicated during play, either by more medical conditions (patient with stigma attempts suicide, patient with chronic disease skips regular treatment and needs emergency treatment) or by further personal complications (doctor tries to convince son to talk to dying father, but son is prejudiced against doctor.)</p>
<p>So what I'm looking for is: more tropes! I'm racking my brains for other tropes that actually get used in medical dramas. Can anyone think of any other abstract medical conditions or personal complications that occasionally show up?</p>

                            ER just wrapped up a plotline where a patient came into the ER, was misdiagnosed, had a stroke, lost the use of his right arm, lost his job as a result, the stress broke up his family, and then he abducted and attempted to murder the doctor who was in charge during the original incident.

<p>Misdiagnosis and Munchausen's Syndrome, as well as malingering, are definitely possibilities I would want to show up in play; thanks for mentioning these, Daniel and Jason. They do pose a problem, though. When you start a new game (or reboot after resolving a medical issue,) you generate your initial medical condition/personal complication pair. Misdiagnosis and Munchausen's both require an initial diagnosis to be treated seriously, then discovered to be false, so they're more of a plot twist. The problem is implementing this. Using Quintin's Medical Mystery suggestion on the personal complication side might be a solution, but stands out as not quite the same as a real personal complication; I tried to phrase the complications in a way so that they could describe conflicts between two arbitrary participants (patient and doctor, patient and relative, relative and doctor, doctor and doctor.)</p>
<p>This might be resolvable by rephrasing it as "Disputed: someone won't receive or assist treatment because they disagree with symptoms or diagnosis". That allows for ego battles between doctors, stubborn parents who refuse to accept that their child is sick, patients who refuse to accept that they are cured (malingering,) and Rich's suggestion of pushing for a more experimental treatment. "Funding" would work the same way, except it has to do with financial disagreements (the homeless person needing a zillion-dollar treatment, patients losing their job and thus can't afford care for a chronic illness.) We can also have Legal complications: doctor wants to save patient, state wants to execute him... or family members sue for legal right to make medical decisions.</p>
<p>Looking at that list of relationships I wrote above (patient and doctor, patient and relative, relative and doctor, doctor and doctor,) and factoring in the condemned prisoner and homeless patient tropes, I see a need for "society" as another possible partner in conflict. Oh, and "administration"; how can we forget that? I'm beginning to see the complications as listing key words for possible opposition pairs. I'm almost tempted to "depersonalize" personal complications and broaden it to include resources, to handle scarcity issues, but I think I may handle scarce resources another way.</p>
<p>It's beginning to look like I may be able to abstract some keywords from the medical conditions, in a similar manner. Like: chronic, terminal, contagious, critical, depressive. I think these will provide the "hooks" that complications would attach to. But I'll have to think about it.</p>

                            Patient splits staff -- one part of the team wants to do one thing, one another. It could be because the condition is baffling and controversial, or maybe the patient's personality is just that way. <br/><br/>Here's a brief typology of "hateful patients" from a famous article in the New England Journal of Medicine:<br/>"The insatiable dependence of "hateful patients" leads to behaviors that group them into four stereotypes: dependent clingers, entitled demanders, manipulative help-rejecters and self-destructive deniers."<br/><br/>(Abstract at <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/298/16/883" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/298/16/883</a> )<br/><br/>Another thing worth mentioning in the medical setting is the concept of "frequent fliers" -- in any specialty, there are folks with regular problems who get regular treatment and get on with their lives.  Then there are patients who are seen over and over and over again -- maybe because they don't get better with the usual treatment, or they sabotage their own treatment, or they have a terrible home situation that makes them sick again, or they just like the attention, or they're just unlucky. Inevitably, the frequent fliers take up a disproportionate amount of time and resources.  <br/><br/>In gaming terms, maybe they're a sort of disadvantage that keeps coming back until you resolve it or buy it off?                        </div>
