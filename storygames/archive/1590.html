                    East of the Sun, West of the Moon.<br/><br/>No, not the Norwegian folktale, or the movie of Max von Sydow telling it, or the play adapted from it, or the book which contains it and is illustrated by Kay Nielsen. Not the SF book by John Ringo either, or the jazz song, or the album by A-Ha. My new work-in-concept.<br/><br/>Maybe I need a new working title, one that hasn't been used quite so much. Anyway:<br/><br/>ESWM is a work of creative nonfiction which sets out to explore and ultimately collapse the opposition between "solar" and "lunar" ways of approaching life. "Solar" and "lunar" are organizing symbols meaning (approximately and with lots and lots of disclaimers):<br/><br/>Solar: Rational, Western, modern, "masculine", sensory, conscious, concrete, left-brained, thinking, verbal, rules-based.<br/>Lunar: Mystical, Eastern, pre- or postmodern, "feminine", intuitive, unconscious, abstract, right-brained, feeling, visio-spacial, ritual-based.<br/><br/>(I use the scare quotes to indicate that "masculine" and "feminine" as stereotypes are even more inaccurate to actual masculinity and femininity than the other terms are to the domains they point to.)<br/><br/>My plan is to start the book with the left page of each opening holding a "solar" (rational, verbal) explanation of my thesis and the right page containing art/ritual/poetry/stories/imagery reflecting on the left page. As the book goes on the two aspects first come into two columns on the same page, then start alternating, then blend together into something approximately with the feel of an illuminated/illustrated (or even graphic-novel) version of Annie Dillard's <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i>. (If you're not familiar with it, she introduces scientific facts and plays with them in a poetic-prose way that eventually coalesces with the human themes she's exploring.) The typefaces, initially distinct, morph into a single typeface. <br/><br/>(I'm looking for a talented layout person/artist to collaborate with, by the way â€“ co-author credit and joint ownership of the result.)<br/><br/>Anyway, the relevance, if you were wondering, is that I want to embed a game in the book and am soliciting ideas for what that might look like. Off-the-wall suggestions are welcomed, indeed encouraged.<br/><br/>I think this is the scariest idea I've ever had.                </div>

                            Um, in what sense do you mean "Western" and "Eastern"? Because this seems clearly related to the idea of "yang" and "yin" in Asian cosmology and I can't think of a single East Asian people who describe themselves as being particularly "yin." Generally speaking, the state is "yang" and private life is "yin." Western powers traditionally characterized non-Western peoples as effiminate and mystical, but this was defintitely imposed and not a part of Asian self image.                        </div>

                            Pretty much part of my point really. I meant to say that the lists are stereotypes rather than realities.                        </div>

                            The game should follow the premise. Your character should be seen as one way at the start and unfold into the other through play.                        </div>
