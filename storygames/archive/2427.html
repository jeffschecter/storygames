                    Hey everybody. Help me pick this apart. I'm sure it's clunky, can you help me smooth the edges and make it more user friendly?<br/><br/><b>Doom Keys</b><br/>Doom Keys are kind of a fusion of Conspiracy of Shadowsâ€™ Doom counter and The Shadow of Yesterdayâ€™s Keys. It is intended for use in the The Shadow of Yesterday. Iâ€™m trying to make a system wherein players not used to letting characters go through their own description can decide to risk character death for reward.<br/><br/>Doom Keys cost nothing to purchase and do not count against you in terms of the rule that states that you canâ€™t increase the same kind of thing twice in a row (i.e., normally you canâ€™t buy two Keys in a row).<br/><br/>When you purchase a Doom Key, it will have an object in the game world. This object is usually filled by an NPC or an NPC Organization. This NPC or Organization will now pursue your character (is now revealed to have been pursuing your character) and will seek some level of harm against you. You will also gain a new Pool called Doom. This is determined by the current level of your Doom, as represented by the threat level of your new antagonist. When you purchase your Doom Key, your Doom level will start at 1.<br/><br/>For example, a player is playing Montana Smith, a famous parapsychologist and adventurer. Montanaâ€™s player decided that a chance meeting with Nazis would make for a great story and adversary and picks up a Doom Key for free:<br/><br/><b>Doom of the Nazis</b><br/>The Nazis pursue Montana Smith, and wish him, and any who aid or befriend him, harm. Nazis may now announce that they intend to kill Montana Smith.<br/>Gain 1 XP every time the Nazis hurt you.<br/>Gain 2 XP every time the Nazis strike a minor blow against you (kill your hirelings, disrupt your life, destroy your property, bring your reputation into question).<br/>Gain 5 XP every time the Nazis strike a major blow against you (abduct your friends, torture you, permanently injure you, destroy your reputation).<br/>Buyoff: Give up your Doom Pool to the Nazis.<br/><br/>The player also gets a Doom Pool ranked at 1. The player can use the Pool like any other Pool, but in addition to other Pool usages (e.g. a player could spend a point of Vigor and a point of Doom on a roll). The description of the results should either involve the object of the Doom Key or the roll should be against the object of the Key.<br/><br/>At any time thereafter, the Pool may be increased normally. Unlike other Pools, it has a maximum size of 6. As you increase the Pool, so should the description of the NPC or Organization increasing their efforts against you. At every odd level size of the Pool (1, 3, 5), the NPC or Organization gains a weapon with deals +1 harm to you (either by addition or separation â€“ three +1 harm weapons, a +2 weapon and a +1 weapon, or a +3 weapon).<br/><br/><b>Giving up your Doom Pool</b><br/>So, youâ€™re either ready to destroy your enemy forever or die trying. Have the GM frame a scenario where your character and any other characters that need to be involved are confronting the object of your Doom. Announce that you are giving up your Doom Pool. The GM now has this Pool to use in the conflict. The stakes are set for you: Does the NPC get the harm/revenge that they want, or do you force them to give it up? Win or lose, your Key is now bought off along with the normal 10 XP.                </div>

                            Hey Mark, in what way is this better than a straight-up Key of Doom, where you earn experience by furthering your inevitable demise?  As a player I'd jump at this, because it represents a free Key I would have gladly paid for anyway.                        </div>

                            Montana Smith is riding on a motorcycle attempting to escape from a small contingent of Nazis sent to clear the roadway before the Furher will proceed from one large town to another via motorcade. Having been discovered, Montana decides to high tail it.<br/><br/>The player rolls his Driving ability ranked at Competent (based on Instinct). He rolls + 0 - and gets a +1. The GM rolls for the Nazis, which are ranked at Adept. They roll 0 0 0, giving them a +2. The player spends a point of Instinct. Because he is fighting his Doom, he can also spend a point of his Doom pool. He has a total of  two bonus dice. He rolls and gets a + and 0, giving him + + 0, meaning a total of +3, a Marginal success.<br/><br/>Does that work?                        </div>

                            Jason: A Key of Doom doesn't give you this distinct line of Character Death versus non Character Death. Maybe you're saying that purchasing the Key of Doom means that as well? If I get rid of the free part, does that make it sound better?<br/><br/>I guess the idea is that I wanted to force the Key to not only be a flag (Hey! I like this enemy! I'm prepared to die against this enemy!) but also a guideline for how powerful to make the enemy by watching the player build their Doom Pool. I also wanted to make it very simple to determine when a player was willing to put their character on the line.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't hit on was how to refresh the Doom Pool. The simple answer would be to have a scene with the NPC or a member of the Organization that enriched our sense of the Doom that might befall the character, but I just can't seem to word it right.                        </div>

Hmm, maybe I'm not being simple enough. I need a method of encouraging players to risk their characters' possible deaths (to give them the excitement that they've asked for), but not force it on everyone. This method should reward them for risking themselves and give clear guidelines as to when their character is to die.<br/><br/>Maybe just have them take a Key of Doom and make death a possibility only with that opponent (using the normal Harm track and stakes guidelines) would work.                        </div>

                            Honestly, this sounds more and more like a social contract/at-table issue.  Do your players have a hard time telling you what they want?  Do you guys have a hard time discussion acceptable boundaries and stuff?  My first thought would be to push for conflicts in which they actively wanted to take big risks, which lead to big excitement.                        </div>

They have had a tough time in the past, yes. We've played games where death was too random for some, not a real risk for others, and not desired at all by the rest. I just can't figure out a way, with TSOY, that is, to have death on the line without it being voluntary or mediated by the GM.<br/><br/>I want something that is up-front and declarative. I want something that will reward players more for risking themselves, because without the risk for the reward, the possibility of death doesn't satiate them.<br/><br/>I will have an honest talk with them and see if it can't be done without altering the rules.                        </div>
