One of my personal targets is to do something positive and tangible for the indie/story games community/movement/scene/whatever, as I've got so much out of it over the last couple of years. <br/><br/>But what? I'm not a games designer - at least I don't have an idea for a new game - and I don't want to produce something for the sake of ticking a box. I've also rejected ideas such as moving into distribution (one of my pet peeves as a UK-based Kickstarterholic) as that would be too involved and I'm not sure I'd be willing to make that commitment without having done a lot more research first.<br/><br/>As someone whose first job was in comics retail, and who had friends who set up their own (failed) games shop, I've always had an interest in the "dollars and sense" side of the hobby, and it is in this area that I think I could have the most positive impact. My local games shop, Leisure Games, is actually very good at supporting independent games, but I'm aware that it is a bit of an exception and even then it took me years of visiting the shop before I even knew an indie scene even existed.<br/><br/>A couple of things have struck me:<br/><br/>1) Large parts of the independent publishing community has developed entirely without retail support and doesn't feel it really needs support. If you're happy with the sales you get via your website (or aren't even looking to make a return on it at all), why bother with things like wholesale discounts?<br/>2) Most retailers don't even know where to start in terms of supporting indie games even if they want to.<br/><br/>From what I've seen, the indie scene is quite switched on to the idea of organising at conventions, but I haven't seen much evidence of an interest in trying to reach out to retailers. I think that's a shame because at conventions you are predominantly reaching out to trad gamers for the most part (not that I have anything against trad gamers; just that it is a dwindling audience), whereas at the retail level there is potentially a much wider audience.<br/><br/>So my idea is this: what if someone produced an accessible guide to the indie scene which retailers could sell and which was designed to inform consumers and retailers alike what games were out there and what they do?<br/><br/>What I have in mind is something not dissimilar to the <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgissue/46879/the-good-games-guide-issue-1" rel="nofollow">Good Games Guide</a> which Games Workshop published in 1985 (before they got gobbled up by Citadel Miniatures), something which, as a young gamer, I found invaluable in terms of giving me an idea of the breadth of games that were out there. It was a mixture of articles introducing people to the hobby, separated into subject areas, a handful of scenarios and similar materials for the more established gamer, and a classified section. It had about 60 A4 black and white pages (with a full colour insert that was essentially a GW catalogue) and cost \xa31.25 (\xa33.21/$5.04/\u20ac3.81 in today's money), although I seem to recall they gave it away free quite a lot.<br/><br/>It strikes me that a publication like that would have several uses. For the retailer who already stocks indie games, it would serve as a way to introduce consumers to what they have in stock. For the retailer who doesn't stock them, it would both function as a way to introduce them to the scene and as a standalone product in its own right. I would want it to have appeal to the open minded trad gamer, indie gamer and newbie alike, and have something for each of them.<br/><br/>My current thinking would be to produce a guide along these lines in time for the UK Games Expo in May 2014. It would probably be produced by a predominantly UK-based team, be somewhat UK-centric and my focus would be on UK retailers, but let's face it it wouldn't be doing its job if it didn't also reflect on mainland Europe and North America. It would be backed up by a website (or piggy-back off another website) with additional material, links, etc. Off the top of my head, it would include features such as:<br/><br/>- What are story games? A general introduction.<br/>- The five games you must have<br/>- Whose story is it anyway? (introducing ideas about GM'd/GMless/GMful games)<br/>- Horror stories<br/>- Romance games<br/>- Community playing games<br/>- Redefining fantasy - a guide to indie dungeon crawlers, etc.<br/>- Inclusivity (how to tackle something like gender without being tokenistic is something I'd need advice on)<br/>- The odd article on techniques (maybe a jargon buster)<br/>- The odd exclusive Fiasco playset/Monsterhearts skin/*World playbook (possibly more of these on the supporting website)<br/>- A guide to self-publishing and getting your game into retail (possibly something for the supporting website rather than the guide itself)<br/>- A classifieds section (too old fashioned?)<br/><br/>So, what do you think? If it is a dumb idea, I'd rather know now than waste any time on it. Some questions:<br/><br/>1) Could such a product work? If I'm misunderstanding something here, please correct me.<br/>2) Is it trying to do too much? Should I be thinking about something with a narrower appeal?<br/>3) Do such things already exist? Please point me to them.<br/>4) What should such a publication include?<br/>5) If this is a stupid idea, what else could I be doing?<br/><br/>Thanks for your time!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421250/#Comment_421250" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T09:56:01+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  9:56AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider looking to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hobby-Games-The-100-Best/dp/1932442960" rel="nofollow">Hobby Games: The 100 Best</a> as inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421254/#Comment_421254" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T11:04:13+00:00" title="September  9, 2013 11:04AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say it's such a good idea, I'm totally stealing it and doing the same for my comic book line here in Peru.

Rely heavily on cooperation and input from the big, prominent and ambitious indies (basically anybody who publishes regularly and attempts to achieve a significant positive cash flow), and have them participate in paying for what amounts to an ambitious marketing project. (It is obviously tricky to get an indie publisher to pay for anything - they rarely have margins for it, so it'd necessarily be a really thin slice of the budget that they could cover.) Put a prominent date on it ("Story Games in 2014") to imply a presence in time. Distribute en masse for free.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that while a guide like this would be culturally gratifying as a project, I don't think that it would be a commercially viable venture in itself; the customer interest in buying a book about buying a book would be quite thin, and thus a guide like this would best serve if it were a free, somewhat exclusive thing that was successfully pushed at retailers and alpha customers (people who are in the right places such as conventions and central stores) in a time-limited fashion; I'd envision a project like this to involve a print run in the hundreds (or low thousands at the most, if you got somebody to deal with American distribution for it), which you'd get rid of over a single year's convention circuit. Revise and republish next year, if you still feel like it at that time.<br/><br/>While I think that a book like this would be worthwhile as a cultural enterprise, the funding is tricky, especially if you share my belief in this not being viable as something people would pay for. Crowdfunding seems like the best bet, as you could get indie publishers to put up the funding rewards (pdfs of their games or whatever), and this is clearly a community interest project that should attract at least a little bit of interest from anybody who feels themselves part of the community, such as it is.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421276/#Comment_421276" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T14:01:46+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  2:01PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2013 2:02PM by mease19.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, I think a story games version of Hobby Games: The 100 Best, with story game designers writing essays about a game the love that they didn't design, would go over really well.  It'd become a reference book with critical commentary about games, a window into the designers' personalities and thought processes, and a guide to finding the best of what's around right now.  In 5 years, I think a sequel would be equally well received.  It could also find a wider market among teachers and board and video game designers who are looking for what they can learn from RPGs.

I saw that there was a lot going on, but that it was buried in forums, G+ and disparate websites. A central guide to story games would be awesome. I'd start with a website to gather the information and then work from there into a hard format guide, but that's the way I approach things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421288/#Comment_421288" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T16:39:54+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  4:39PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with retailers is that they enjoy giving out free stuff as well as anybody, so as long as your guide is not an outright anti-retail creed, I'd expect most retailers to be willing to distribute it to their customers. (I could be wrong, I don't have that much experience with how people around the world run their retail stores.) After all, you'd presumably provide clear and concise instructions for retailers on how to stock these games in that very same booklet, giving them a fair chance to become the local primary source for these types of games (at least insofar as brick-and-mortar stores can achieve that these days). Sure, the lazy retailer won't go for it, for the lazy retailer hates change, and from his viewpoint it's just a pain in the ass to learn to work with a different distribution scheme merely to offer new shit to their customers, when they're already giving him money for the old shit. I don't think that this lazy retailer should be your concern, he's not in your target audience anyway; the retailers you're interested in getting on board are the ones that are willing to invest in new products and services, as those are the ones that are likely to be willing to stock new games (and your guide) in the first place.<br/><br/>A Free RPG Day giveaway makes sense in that it's an established way for free stuff to enter the retail channel. On the other hand, it doesn't do anything about the product being anti-retail; a retailer won't take it - heck, the FRPGD staff probably won't take it - if it's perceived as being hostile to the very idea of traditional distribution.<br/><br/>If traditional retail is a concern for your plan, then it could be a good idea to combine this guide with a bit of distribution planning: develop a back-end for retail orders of various games with their publishers, and provide clear instructions for retailers who are interested in stocking these games in the guide itself; ideally a single phone number or website or whatever where they can enter their orders all in one place, instead of having to deal with publishers individually. (This level of achievement should be big enough to bring a significant number of publishers out of the woodwork to help you with the project, by the way - many of us are basically interested in any plot that might bring us retail attention without unreasonable expenses and risks.) Basically, make it a distribution catalog.<br/><br/>Of course the above is quite a bit of work - as much work as writing the guide itself, roughly. Thus it's likely smart to weight things carefully: do you really need the retail channel for your vision in the first place? My own take would be that a for-pay guide would be a very marginal product, and therefore a free electronic thing with a free paper version for the convention circuit would work best in terms of outreach. If you think that there is commercial potential in selling the guide (as in, there are people out there who'd be willing to buy it instead of e.g. buying a new game), then perhaps you could make it work as an ordinary product in the retail channel as well. I can't see it attracting much attention like that, though.<br/><br/>(In case you're wondering why I'm lukewarm on the commercial possibilities of a games guide like this, it's because I've never seen those become heavy sellers. It's a necessary genre of literature, and we've had two or three beginner's guides to roleplaying games authored and published in Finland over the last few decades, but I haven't gotten the impression that they'd have sold much. It's the kind of book that a library will order for their collection, but not one that a gaming enthusiast will pay real money for. Besides, with the Internet in the state it is, we opted to develop our Finnish equivalent of this idea as a website; that's where people who are real beginners in roleplaying will find the information they need.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421290/#Comment_421290" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T17:34:16+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  5:34PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2013 5:38PM by catty_big.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James I think it's a fantastic idea. There are a lot of different suggestions being bandied about, speaking to what it should contain, whether or not it should be free or carried by retailers etc. etc. You obviously need to decide on all that yourself after there's been a bit more of a build-up of traffic, but FWIF here's my 2p:<br/><br/>\u2022\tIt should be on reasonably good quality gloss paper.<br/>\u2022\tIt should an annual round-up of what's hot and happening in the world of small press indie RPGs. <br/>\u2022\tIt shouldn't become- or look like- the usual suspects bigging up each other's games.<br/>\u2022\tIt should contain short (ten line paragraph) reviews, slightly longer op ed pieces and a list of all the small press games that have been published during the previous year, plus a look ahead to what's scheduled to be coming out in the year to come.<br/>\u2022\tIn order to make it free, a small number of ads could be carried, but heavily vetted for relevance, forex Leisure Games. <br/>\u2022\tIt should be available in both print and pdf format.<br/>\u2022\tIt should be available on an Internet pod site such as DriveTHRU RPG.<br/> <br/>To give you an idea of what it could look like, following are two examples of online magazines with similar aspirations: <br/><a href="http://www.gamesgazette.co.uk/gg/main.php" rel="nofollow">Games Gazette</a><br/><a>Flagship</a><br/><br/>Finally, I\u2019d be more than willing to contribute for free, with either articles and/or copywriting or whatever <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>.\uf04a<br/><br/>Good luck, and keep us posted!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421319/#Comment_421319" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-10T07:38:51+00:00" title="September 10, 2013  7:38AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone, the feedback has been much more positive than I was expecting. I sort of assumed someone would pipe up with an example of someone crashing and burning trying to do this in the past!<br/><br/>Having slept on it, I'm warming to the Free RPG Day idea. I think that gives it a focus and would be an easier way to get into shops. I'm trying to decide whether simply distribute it to coincide with that day or whether to make it a fullblown Free RPG Day product, which would mean having to meet the following <a href="http://www.freerpgday.com/publishers.htm" rel="nofollow">restrictions</a>:<br/><br/>\u2022 Inclusion of the Free RPG Day logo on the front or back of the product.<br/>\u2022 No MSRP anywhere on the product (or a MSRP of $0.00 can be listed).<br/>\u2022 If an independent RPG, the product should include quickstart rules at minimum, with a STRONG recommendation to include an <br/>adventure and pre-generated characters to create a complete demo package for the consumer and retailer --- whereby 50% of the <br/>product will include never-before-seen material.<br/>\u2022 100% never-before-seen material if purely an adventure module.<br/>\u2022 Minimum page count of 16 pages (with or without cover, though we recommend a 10pt C1S color cover).<br/>\u2022 Print and/or PDF versions of the product will NOT be disseminated anywhere else until MONDAY, JULY 1ST, 2013.<br/><br/>That would rule out a soft launch at a con, but the advantage would be that the distribution would be done by someone else.<br/><br/>I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> that there are issues regarding distribution to unpack as well. I might start a separate thread on that.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/catty_big">@catty_big</a>: I broadly agree with you, but what do you mean by the "usual suspects"? Because I'd very much want it to feature the "big" indie games (if that isn't a contradiction in terms) that people might have heard of, not simply to flatter the designers but because I see them as gateways to open people up to other games. So yeah, I'd want it to heavily feature the well established games and for it to feature story games which are based on popular genres like Dungeon Crawling (not my personal favourite) - because even they are tiny compared to a game like Pathfinder. Equally, it will have failed in my view if it gave the impression there were just a handful of story games out there or that you needn't bother with the rest.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/NathanBlack">@NathanBlack</a>: thanks, and I've been following Story Game World. I've been using my own <a href="http://proj-awe.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">tumblr</a> account as a bit of a scrapbook, and plan to increase its output over the next couple of months.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421461/#Comment_421461" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-13T09:07:05+00:00" title="September 13, 2013  9:07AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, thanks for the feedback (both here and on the <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=16119&amp;p=172032" rel="nofollow">Indiemeet forum</a>). My thinking has evolved somewhat in that I think that maybe launching into a publication of the scale I was initially thinking of might be too big an ask. As an alternative, I'm considering writing and coordinating the production of a series of leaflets introducing games which can be handed out at cons or in shops, and backing those up with a website, which will have more of an article rather than news site.<br/><br/>Basically, my thinking is that if I can't do that then there's no point in trying something more ambitious, whereas if it was a success I could think about raising my horizons. It also means being in the position of having something more tangible more quickly and, for example, being in a position to field test the materials in time for Dragonmeet (to address one of <a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> W's concerns).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
