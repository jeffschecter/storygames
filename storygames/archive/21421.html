The relationship between AW's voluntarily suffering harm through seize by force and Eowyn's player-driven risk management has lead me down twisting paths to a peculiar thought.<br/><br/>Instead of rolling the dice to accomplish something, what if players only rolled to avoid bad things happening? The expansion of the "saving throw" to encompass other areas of gameplay could provide an interesting mechanic. Save vs. poverty! Save vs. time loss! Save vs. angering the gods! That's a tad glib, but I take it you understand my meaning.<br/><br/>Short form: a player says he wants to do X, and the GM says, "Sure, but you're going to risk Y," where Y is a hard move. X automatically occurs, but Y is up in the air. Player then rolls to see how badly Y hurts him.<br/><br/>As a more concrete example, let us say that the Duke Boys wish to give the ol' one-two to Boss Hogg so maybe he'll ease up on them. Normally, this would play out as seize by force (depending on situation), and you'd roll +hard, then you'd roll +harm suffered. What if we cut out the middleman and said, "If you want to do that, you're going to risk suffering harm."<br/><br/>(This might lead to some negotiation between players and GM on how to mitigate the risk taken. For example, the player might know that Boss Hogg has a mighty big gun and that the player character is liable to suffer serious injury in the process, so he tells the GM he wants to relieve Boss Hogg of his gun, get the drop on him, etc.)<br/><br/>Beyond rolling the dice to determine the consequences (saving vs. the hard move), the success of the action is assured. Yes, you can punch Boss Hogg in the face, and yes, he'll lighten up for a time, but the harm roll is what really matters, so make your saving throw and see how much it stings.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468828/#Comment_468828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T20:40:38+00:00" title="January 11, 2018  8:40PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2018 8:41PM by DeReel.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why make a saving throw, then, when you could negotiate the consequences so they'd be tailor-made for the situation at hand ?

We had some conversations about this some years ago. <br/><br/>A few observations:<br/><br/>1. The Otherkind approach, Eowyn's resolution, and AW's "moves" - all related concepts - are tricky in this sense.<br/><br/>They *look* like mechanics which tell you if you succeed, but, REALLY, they're about whether you suffer the danger. <br/><br/>So, the dynamic you're describing is already in there (with varying odds of actual failure, which is highest in AW and lowest in Otherkind dice). It's the most common outcome of all those mechanics!<br/><br/>2. Taking the character'a success off the table - just assuming it's guaranteed - is definitely an option. <br/><br/>I've seen people play AW diceless: just assume every roll is a 7-9. It can work!<br/><br/>I thought about doing that in Eowyn. You'll notice that the phrasing of "challenge" allows this possibility - you can easily say, "defeating this guy is not in question. Clearly, you're determined enough to kill him. Rather, we're curious about: can you avoid his poison dagger?" I do that sometimes when I play.<br/><br/>3. What it does do is change the nature of the conversation at the table in subtle ways.<br/><br/>I find that I generally prefer interactions where the player must overtly indicate their goal or aim.<br/><br/>Why? It makes for more player-driven games. Sure, most of the time it's the same whether we assume success or roll for it. But sometimes you get those moments where you didn't realize you were slightly off until the player is forced to verbalize their aims.<br/><br/>Here's an illustration:<br/><br/>"Ok, so your goal here is clearly to kill him. Let's roll!"<br/><br/>Option A. This is overt and so, on a success, that's what happens.<br/><br/>Option B. This is unstated. So we roll abd then we play out the enemy dying. <br/><br/>Same, right?<br/><br/>But! Once in a while it turns out that the player was attacking the opponent with his sword, but asking "what I said your goal" reveals more.<br/><br/>Player: "Wait a minute! You know what? Sure, i'm probably gonna kill him in the process, but what I really want is to humiliate him in front of the Queen!"<br/><br/>Under Option B, sometimes you play it out and the enemy is dead, and we never got to learn or figure out what the player really wanted. (And because we didn't have the conversation, sometimes the player didn't learn that either!)<br/><br/>It's subtle, but, over time, the effect is noticeable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468838/#Comment_468838" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T21:43:23+00:00" title="January 11, 2018  9:43PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not really following your point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> Paul;  How does this shift in perspective come from "roll for consequences" and not just from the fact that you are ASKING the player what their goal is?

Some people skip it, instead. If it's not required by the rules, skipping it becomes much easier, and you might find yourself doing it more often.<br/><br/>For an extreme case, consider a hardened D&amp;D fanatic trying to GM the game. He would almost certainly skip that step if it wasn't overtly indicated!<br/><br/>Second, it indicates to the player how much power they have in the situation, and puts emphasis on it.<br/><br/>For instance, if I have had lots of experiences with mediocre GMs, I might hold back or try to give a "safe" answer when the GM asks, "Ok, but what are you hoping to achieve?"<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, an important die roll/choice depends on that, I'm more likely to sit back and give it some serious thought. ("This is going to cost me one of my die choices? I'd better make this good/take advantage of the opportunity.")<br/><br/>Like I said, it's subtle, but I see it as having a small impact on the game.<br/><br/>You're right that it's a minor difference, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468841/#Comment_468841" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T22:00:36+00:00" title="January 11, 2018 10:00PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2018 10:00PM by Airk.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still not connecting with this.

But otherwise the two procedures are almost identical.)<br/><br/>I think we're agreeing!<br/><br/>ValyrianSteelKatana, you may want to do a search for "Danger Rolls", by Levi Kornelsen.

It's a reaction to a Pathfinder game I'm playing in with all the early 2000s design baggage that entails. Normally, I'm fine with the standard task resolution of traditional RPGs, but the d20 system's foibles (and follies) have been a bit of a sticking point.\n<blockquote>With AW moves the PC acts, and that action triggers the move, while with a save roll the PC's action triggers no mechanic by itself, it's the GM that decides there's some danger to roll for. </blockquote>\nUnless, of course, there are mechanics layered over the saving throw system that indicate situations when a saving throw is needed. For instance:<br/><br/>SEIZE BY FORCE<br/>When you seize something by force or secure your hold on something, there is an exchange of harm. Choose three of the following, <b>then roll the suffer harm move</b>:<br/><br/>\u25cf you take definite hold of it<br/>\u25cf you suffer little harm<br/>\u25cf you inflict terrible harm<br/>\u25cf you impress, dismay, or frighten your enemy<br/><br/>SEDUCE OR MANIPULATE<br/>When you try to seduce, manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, or lie to someone, tell them what you want them to do and give them a reason. For NPCs: they\u2019ll go along with you, unless or until some fact or action betrays the reason you gave them, but you're <b>acting under fire </b>to avoid being ensnared in their own schemes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468866/#Comment_468866" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-12T18:02:16+00:00" title="January 12, 2018  6:02PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that definitely works.<br/><br/>If you look at Apocalypse World, you'll find that there are already quite a few moves that work like that.<br/><br/>There are also a few games (Gun Thief, Undying) which use "moves" but never have you roll at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468867/#Comment_468867" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-12T19:03:21+00:00" title="January 12, 2018  7:03PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, yeah, in that case, I totally agree with Paul, I was just confused.<br/><br/>Also, yes, Levi's stuff is SUPER CLEVER in a lot of ways and I'm glad to see it discussed a little more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468883/#Comment_468883" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-13T04:33:41+00:00" title="January 13, 2018  4:33AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2018 4:35AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worth noting:<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, the <i>GM</i> does something that leads <i>directly</i> to the save roll ("saving throw").

For instance: stealth. Say the players are sneaking around a military base. They're holed up in a hiding space, but need to make a break through the open. At any time, a guard could walk around the corner, but they wouldn't know that until its too late. How would you negotiate this? The players can read the GM by seeing how severe the risk is:<br/><br/>Scenario A: The GM knows there's a guard coming around the corner. Thus, they say the risk is high.<br/>Scenario B: The GM knows there isn't a guard coming around the corner. Thus, they say the risk is low.<br/>Scenario C: The GM lets the dice decide if there's a guard. Thus, they say the risk <i>could be</i> high.<br/><br/>There could be ways around these pitfalls, but there'll always be a big burden on the GM. If the GM slips up, they might accidentally reveal hidden information. You might have been waiting to see if there's a patrol, but now that you know someone's coming, waiting looks like cheating. You may need to "play stupid" because the GM slipped up.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>...<br/><br/>I find that I generally prefer interactions where the player must overtly indicate their goal or aim.<br/><br/>Why? It makes for more player-driven games. Sure, most of the time it's the same whether we assume success or roll for it. But sometimes you get those moments where you didn't realize you were slightly off until the player is forced to verbalize their aims.<br/><br/>...</p></div></blockquote>\nFunny. I agree, but for an entirely different reason. I've found clearly verbalizing your goals keeps consequences and risks consistent across GMs.<br/><br/>For instance, say a player is trying to sneak into a fortress. They come up with a plan to climb a wall. The intended goal is to sneak into the fortress, and the method is by climbing a wall. So if the player fails, they might make a lot of noise as they're climbing. But if the player only says "I want to climb this wall", then the GM might think "oh, then if they fail, they fall off the wall". Now there's two different scenarios that can come from the same action, one of which (falling) is potentially more severe than the other (getting spotted). And when the same action can have two different consequences, the player has to analyze their GM. "If I roll low, will I fall off the wall, or will I get spotted? I think I can manage if I get spotted, but I don't think I can survive the fall. What will the GM do?" Not exactly a roleplaying mindset.<br/><br/>But let's say the rules make the players verbalize their goals. Assuming the dice resolution mechanics are clear, the player knows exactly what they risk at all times, regardless of who the GM is. The GM and players are on the same wavelength; both know what the players are trying to accomplish, and so everyone knows the risks. Thus, no one needs to analyze each other's personalities, and so everyone can roleplay.<br/><br/>There's still the problem of hidden player knowledge. If one of the players is planning a betrayal, then stating their goals out loud might be a bad idea. Then again, in an age of virtual tabletops and private messages, that problem might solve itself. And there's always notecards, though the act of passing cards in and of itself is suspicious, not to mention slow. You'd need to find a way to get information across the table without tipping everyone off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468902/#Comment_468902" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-13T20:54:36+00:00" title="January 13, 2018  8:54PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hmm.

Character progression becomes about minimizing risks and maximizing rewards. Everything the players may wish to do becomes more controlled and less costly to them.

You could pretend no one knows, but you've been biased. Even if the game turns out exactly the same, there's still that lingering doubt. Did you act that way because you read the script? How do you know?<br/><br/>Keep in mind, you aren't just second guessing yourself. Everyone else at the table is judging you, too. Say the players are sneaking into a warehouse. There's the guard around the corner. Everyone at the table knows it, but the characters don't. Everyone walks into the open <i>except</i> for one person, who stays behind to tie their shoe. Now, did they stay behind because their shoe was loose, or did they stay behind because they knew they'd get caught? If the characters are acting on information they couldn't possibly know, then the whole narrative becomes compromised. Are things happening because that's how they would happen, or are they happening because the players want them to? In such a situation, I'd be obligated to take the least favorable course of action for my character, or else the table might suspect I'm not roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468916/#Comment_468916" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-14T22:17:54+00:00" title="January 14, 2018 10:17PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2018 10:40PM by DeReel.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't disregard information.
