The archaeologist discovers a journal written by the long dead person while investigating the ruins of the city. The player playing the dead person writes about their life, detailing places while leading up to whatever caused the cataclysm. The archaeologist writes about how the place looks now. I think the idea was that either one could introduce elements that the other would then talk about in their own time. Like the future person might talk about a colliseum with a huge pit in the middle of it, and the past person would then maybe explain how that pit got there, that kind of thing.<br/><br/>The mechanics: I can remember something about white and black stones. I think they were used to say who owed who something (like if the past person is supposed to follow up on something the future person introduced), and also to figure out how far from endgame they were (like after a certain number of stones were used, the cataclysm arrives).<br/><br/>That's all I remember. I'm pretty sure it's a half-baked game sitting somewhere on the net. I'm pretty sure I found the link for it somewhere on story-games, sometime in the past. Any help finding this game would be cool.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125984/#Comment_125984" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T11:41:56+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 11:41AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wyrd something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126349/#Comment_126349" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T20:25:55+00:00" title="February 13, 2008  8:25PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds familiar, but a google search with various combinations of words has turned up nothing.<br/><br/>Well, it turned up Wyrd is Bond plenty of times, but that wasn't what I was looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126677/#Comment_126677" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T16:01:50+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  4:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2008 4:04PM by NickWedig.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a <a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/uru/rj/essay-more-forum-games.html" rel="nofollow">freeform epistolary game made along the lines of Myst</a> by Andrew Plotkin.
