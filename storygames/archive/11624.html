How they influence games and what kind of addition they can give to it. Few examples below but my real quest (as those knowing me might know) is the link between interactive arts and some roleplaying (art larp and some forms of rpg included but not excluding any forms). I've run table top games where major influence to the game has been bodily interaction between players and or gm and players, as well as games where players had their eyes blindfolded to give more influence to soundscape. There are plenty of different tools, techniques, technologies and methods to interact between people, how to use those methods in games and arts are a big question that should be focused on much more then it is at the moment. You can find new forms to play in and what's more interesting to me, from playing in them you can find new forms to create art in/at. Of course the big issue is that the form or technique it self can't be in the focus but it must be used as a tool or otherwise it becomes form before function that wont give to the game/art piece.<br/><br/>So what kind of interaction methods have you been using? Either in games or in arts. And more importantly what forms you have thought of. What technologies are there that are interesting and might create a new form of roleplaying and sharing stories? How could they be used? What it would give to the roleplaying community and games them selfs? And what kind of art might come out of the process if any.<br/><br/>As a background I'm currently organizing "Human|Culture: Theme year of interactive arts" and applications from artists have been so wild that I have found completely new forms of interaction to me and ways to get people to interact with art. And as a gamer I thought how to use these in games.
