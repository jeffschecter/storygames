I'm hoping you can all help me fill out my RPG with a GM (or GMful, GM-like, GMish) collection; I like games in which players contribute largely to the story...games in which most tasks and authorities are distributed more-or-less equally amongst players, but (this time) that have a GM, or are GMfull or GMish in some way. I'm looking for RPGs that aren't too crunchy, somewhere around PbtA games or less. I'm looking for Indie RPGs pretty much exclusively. Also, I like games that are unique, that have novel premises, themes, and unique genres.<br/>Any suggestions would be super appreciated.

Grim and tragic, but with a shimmer of hope.<br/>While maybe not as well-known as <i>Polaris</i>, it's another seminal Forge game, strongly influencing a lot of this community's current favorite games. It includes such (then quite innovative) mechanics as formalized scene-framing with a variety of scene types, multiple PCs per player, shared character pools, stats and HPs for relationships and literally using your feelings for other characters as the weapons you wield in combat. Conflict resolution is via (one of the best existing implementations of) <i>Otherkind</i> dice. In fact, having last played this game not very long ago, I feel most of its mechanics are still unsurpassed in quality of implementation (I mean, for each of them, no other games trying to do the same exact thing slightly differently have managed to do it better). I'm especially fond of its scene-judging process (how the mechanical consequences of a non-conflict scene are decided on), which is something I keep copying shamelessly in most in-progress designs of mine and I'm a bit surprised not a lot of other designers do.<br/>While there are a whole lot of reasons to describe it as the hippiest of storytelling games, and in fact most tasks and authorities are distributed more-or-less equally amongst players (including, for example, the task of describing the nightmare alien monsters in action, which is choral and cooperative), there <i>is</i> a separate GM role in <i>Bliss Stage</i> - which I understand is the main requisite to fit in your "RPG" category, isn't it?

I'm under the impression that the coolest thing about these two games is a set of "trust" mechanics straight out of <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, but where TMW is laser focused on those and plays out as a long one-shot, CC &amp; HW are more... diluted. However, my very limited experience is based on just a short CC demo plus owning a copy of HW but not really enjoying it enough as a read to ever get to read it cover to cover (these days I like short, compact, to the point game texts which launch immediately into how-to instructions... HW has a lot of - arguably interesting - setting information interspersed with rules, which makes it tedious for me to actually parse the rules, but that's just me): in other words, I'm well aware I might be mistaken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460888/#Comment_460888" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T00:09:13+00:00" title="March  4, 2017 12:09AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may also want to take a look at other PbtA games that are not on your list.

A seminal game.<br/><br/>In <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, all have equal weight in establishing the starting situation, but then there's a "GM" who frames scenes (based on the established situation and a strict "precipitate conflict" agenda) and plays several named "NPCs" while each other player only plays one character. The other difference between NPCs and PCs being, PCs have a chance of being recurring characters (but still aren't warranted to). Who the GM is varies from session to session.<br/><br/>In <i>On Mighty Thews</i>, when you take action and succeed (with a dice roll) you get to author parts of the current scene, backstory, NPC action or details that haven't yet been established, taking over what would otherwise be the GM's duties. It's a swords and sorcery game and its sorcery system works <i>exclusively</i> by retroactively establishing actionable facts this way (otherwise there's no "spellcasting" per se).<br/><br/>In <i>Anima Prime</i>, the GM's distinct task is to play the opposition in conflict scenes. In non-conflict scenes, though, their contribution is equal to anybody else's. There's absolutely no pre-established "plot" or backstory: story is moved forward cooperatively - interspersed with conflict scenes (usually battles) which are instead decided with lots of dice-rolling.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I last played <i>Ganakagok</i>, but I remember the game is very structured, with formally defined scenes, acts and arcs. If the game had been designed a couple years later, I believe it wouldn't sport a GM role - but it does. The GM mostly provides opposition, a certain amount of direction and coordination as well, but is strictly limited by the mechanics in what they can do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460892/#Comment_460892" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T02:14:11+00:00" title="March  4, 2017  2:14AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>DayTrippers has a GM, right, <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>?

"Fairy tale medieval Europe" where Latin and Hebrew are magical languages and a lot of familiar cultures are represented.  I mean, I guess most classical fantasy is built out of real-world parts, but Fortune's Fool has a bit less distance from its sources than most.  It is definitely a "we are an adventuring party" game...  So I dunno, it depends on what aspects of D&amp;D/fantasy you're burned out on!
