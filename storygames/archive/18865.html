It's pitched as Reservoir Dogs meets H.P. Lovecraft and it was run to great acclaim at Wyrdcon recently. <br/><br/>They are playing it on Oct.12 from 9:00 pm to 1:00am at Pacific Theatre in Vancouver. If you are interested, send me a message and I'll put you in touch with the organizer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
