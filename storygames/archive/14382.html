Basically, imagine a game built around the discussion trees in Mass Effect, with some tactical turn-based combat to punctuate the relationship-building; that's Bliss Stage LIOW in a nutshell.<br/><br/><br/>I was, and, and always will be a huge fan of the tabletop game, and it's a dream come true to be working on this project.  Please, ask me your questions about it here, and please pledge!  Your support will make this game not only possible but rockin'.  (PSI rockin' come to that.)<br/><br/>I was wondering what all of you would like to see in that game, or what questions you might have about Bliss Stage and the BS Visual Novel. I am not Ben Lehman, so my answers about the tabletop game are pretty much anti-canon, but I'm a damn fine Bliss Stage GM and player with a lot of practical experience in running the damn thing.<br/><br/>In particular, we're going to include some expanded tactical rules for the tabletop game (to impliment in the computer game), and I want to know what you all would like to see in those rules. How to balance and calibrate different weapons, in particular: I want a good way of having the special effects of weapons reflect the relationship it draws on without either screwing the player or forcing them to make dumb or wildly ooc decisions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326780/#Comment_326780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-28T14:01:05+00:00" title="May 28, 2011  2:01PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you say that adapting the tabletop game's mechanical landscape has been a priority in making this computer game?

I picked a VN format for this game because a visual novel was the most appropriate way of doing it.  Including anything other than the roll-and-assign turn based combat seemed to me the definition of missing the point; I'm just adding positioning and Int 5 activated special abilities to the mix; and those abilities are pretty solidly tied to the fiction and character relationships.  Anna's odd mix of friends-with-benefits and mentorship translates to the ability to snipe, for example: Derek's (over)protective streak powers up to a forcefield that protects allies as well as Joshua, and so on.  <br/><br/>My main concern with introducing the weapon activated abilities to tabletop is finding a way to make them organically spring from the IC relationships without people, say, doing durptardedly stupid things IC just to get armor piercing or shields.<br/><br/>As for Trust and Intimacy scenes, yes and no on differentiation.  The majority of scenes can go either way, depending on how you play it.  Hell, there are (implied) sex scenes that don't bump you to Int 5 because it's clear from the context that it's trust building or Trauma Relief instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
