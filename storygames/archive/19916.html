I'm looking for a list or suggestions of RPG reviewers.  I'm looking for reviewers that have skill and style and are entertaining to read.  <br/><br/>I'm putting together a team of writers and looking for someone to cover RPGs.  This would be a paid gig but I would require someone reliable who could contribute regularly (1 review a week minimum).

A thorough critique based on extended play would be invaluable for readers who are already interested but want the full scoop; a quick summary of one or two noteworthy features would be great for readers just looking to familiarize themselves with the array of games out there.  I'd be interested to see which review-reading needs are already well-served by other channels and which aren't.<br/><br/>As for feasibility, it's hard for me to imagine your boardgame criteria -- 4-5 recent plays per review -- working out for RPGs.  However, if we have a Fiasco review based on 4-5 plays over the past two years, an AW review based on a mini-campaign from last year, and a Dungeon World review from a one-shot last week, I could see that working.  <br/><br/>Personally, of the games I've played, 50% were one-shots, 25% were campaigns, and 25% were in-between.  I'd guess that this is fairly typical of the "play a ton of different games" roleplayer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440937/#Comment_440937" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-16T14:55:16+00:00" title="December 16, 2014  2:55PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob Carnel regularly reviews new and experimental indie rpgs<br/><a href="http://thee-rapture.carnel.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thee-rapture.carnel.org</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440959/#Comment_440959" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-18T14:37:54+00:00" title="December 18, 2014  2:37PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback guys.<br/><br/>David - the 4-5 plays per review wasn't a requirement.  I was just explaining what I personally do for my reviews.  I would think a review of a one-shot based off a single play would be valid for something like The Mountain Witch.  <br/><br/>I'm still working through the details on the site/team and holding off at the moment on reaching out to any RPG reviewers.  Still researching a couple of things.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440984/#Comment_440984" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-21T00:24:12+00:00" title="December 21, 2014 12:24AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think i can handle the job; in fact i'd love to do it.
