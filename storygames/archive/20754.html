So, I've had an idea rattling around that I've been wondering how to implement. Thought I'd throw it out here, see if people have a better take on it.<br/><br/><b>Game Pitch:</b> Players are a Hive-mind Alien creature on a foreign exchange program to Earth. Take turns playing the Alien, while the others are the humans. Try to explain culturally foreign concepts to the humans, who have no real touch-stone for understanding it.<br/><br/>I have no good idea how this could be implemented. What I wanted to explore with this was the feeling of alienation and isolation. Straddling the line between two cultures, but not necessarily having the proper tools to bring them to a common ground.<br/><br/>One possible implementation:\n<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li> Each player writes 1 definition-type statement on a note card: "Reading your neighbor's color." "Inverting your probiscus."  Do this twice.</li><li> Each player writes two words and gives them a kind of... context or color. [Kaer] - A social faux pas. [Z'klavn] - A bureaucratic process.</li><li> Pass the definitive statements to the right. The player then attaches one word to each notecard, without looking at the definition.</li><li>Drop 'em all into a box. Take turns being the alien, draw up two notecards. Combine those "roots" to form the actual phrase. Decide what it means. Try and explain the concept to the other humans.</li></ul>\nHow the rest of it gets adjudicated is still being toyed with. Hell, even that up there is just a first pass on this.  What I'm wondering is: what other ways can a game utilize imperfect communication to get this concept across? I'm struggling with how to make the whole notion of imperfect communication the crux of a medium that relies on effective communication.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455825/#Comment_455825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T04:29:28+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  4:29AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2016 4:29AM by David_Berg.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a glorious hybrid of Sign in Stranger with two contest games I wrote.

"Here's what it looks like, here's what's coming out of it, here's the noise it's making," etc., but never, "Here's how it works, here's what it's for, here's what they want you to do with it."  The characters don't speak the same language as their alien hosts, so that's the other communication barrier -- you can never just ask what a thing is, or does, or what the aliens want.  The aliens aren't particularly likely to even be able to engage in any sort of gestural communication with humans, as they could be, like, floating cubes or something.<br/><br/>So, for the possible implementation you just offered, I'd do that, but with this one change:<blockquote>Try and <del>explain</del> <i>convey</i> the concept to the other humans <i>without speech</i>.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455828/#Comment_455828" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T14:36:05+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  2:36PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2016 2:36PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure if I'm fully understanding your implementation Luzelli, but David's idea is great and sounds like it would add a lot of fun to the game :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455857/#Comment_455857" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T21:11:17+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  9:11PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2016 9:12PM by Luzelli.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I took this out for a little test run today. Here's the words we made and how it played out. Hopefully this clarifies the process I put up earlier.<br/><br/><b>Word Roots:</b><br/>Palipla - A cleaning procedure.<br/>Signified by: Phasing between two dimensions in a rhythmic pattern.<br/><br/>Betamee - A patronizing dance.<br/>Signified by: Passing photons between your teammates.<br/><br/>Florbit - An expressive form of art.<br/>Signified by: Protruding your tentacles out of your pockets thrice.<br/><br/>Grraahn- A rebellious activity.<br/>Signified by: Throwing the 7th leg.<br/><br/>Right, so those are the weird culturally significant activities me and my friend came up with. I came up with the words Florbit and Grraahn, and gave them their "definition" (i.e. "a rebellious activity"). He then tacked on what kind of cultural activity they were attached to. The rebellious activity of Grraahn became tied to the act of throwing the 7th leg at your target.<br/><br/><b>Alien Phrases:</b><br/>Then, we mixed em up and came up with two phrases based on these four root words. <br/><br/>The phrase I had was Florbetamee - A patronizing form of the dance style known as Florbit. Requires a teammate to catch and pass the betamee back and forth, thereby showing your superiority.<br/><br/>He choose to describe the alien engaging in a public Grraahn Palipla as a form of protest. The school wouldn't allow the alien to hit the showers after soccer practice until the rest of the humans cleared out.<br/><br/><b>Playing it out:</b><br/>I had a sketch of how the procedure of things would go down after the root words were made and phrases were determined. It's basically a modified Fiasco.\n<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>When you're the alien, set-up the scene to your advantage to help explain this alien activity.</li><li>When you're the human, award the alien a red or white die to bring the scene to an end. Red if you didn't understand the concept. White if you think you did.  Summarize your understanding of the concept (in word or deed).</li><li>The alien will award the human doing the summarizing a red or white die depending on how well they understood the concept.</li><li>At the end, everyone rolls and those results are used to generate an epilogue "My report on the Human's of Planet Earth."  The alien recounts their experience on earth and makes a determination/conclusion about the human species.</li></ul>\n<b>Conclusion:</b><br/>All in all, it was fun but crazy. Truly don't know if I have something to work with here or not. We tried a round of conveying concepts without speech. That really weirded him out. He dropped it pretty instantly, and just went with using actions and context to drive the conveyance. We also informally came up with the rule that you can't use the words on the note-card to explain the concept. So, you couldn't use the words clean for Palipla, etc.  Dunno... it was all weird, but fun. Definitely needs a lot of work. Not the least being, explaining how these words are generated and what each aspect is supposed to be. Took me forever to realize the bottom parts were supposed to be more like actions that the culture does to signify the word.<br/><br/>I think if I changed the structure of phrase generation, I could also make the whole convey without speech bit make more sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455867/#Comment_455867" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-28T16:57:30+00:00" title="August 28, 2016  4:57PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the procedure you're using to generate fun alien mores.<br/><br/>It sounds like you need to nail down the procedure of play now: what do we do with these things once we've determined them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455892/#Comment_455892" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-29T20:07:48+00:00" title="August 29, 2016  8:07PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2016 8:08PM by Luzelli.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It sounds like you need to nail down the procedure of play now: what do we do with these things once we've determined them?</blockquote>\nYeah, this is pretty much where my struggle with this whole idea has been. I'll drop some real-talk so you can see why I thought of doing this, and maybe someone will have a cool idea for how to get this feeling across.<br/><br/>My brother and I grew up as the only brown kids in our entire school, among a sea of white people in 90s Idaho. Not that they were bad or racist or any of that kinda crazy shit... I was just literally the first non-white person any of them had ever seen. On top of that, being Indian, I was also somehow a designated representative of the entire continent of Asia, polytheism, the struggle of all types of colored people, and there was some Arabic stuff thrown in as well. Again, this wasn't people being malicious, it was just straight up ignorance. As an adjusted adult, I totally know how to handle this now. I know how to not take it personal, all that stuff. But at the time, I was just a kid. The upshot of this experience was it felt arbitrarily alienating. Apparently, I was different, I just didn't get why. At school I was the representative of the Other to pretty much everyone around me. At home, I was the representative of the Other to my parents (a little easier there cause I had a brother to help with that). The result is, I don't actually see myself as a product of either culture or environment, and learned to blaze my own trail. <br/><br/>This is the kind of journey I want to capture with the game. If I put it into game terms, I was explaining alien culture to my classmates. When I got older, I learned to make a judgement about my own place within this structure (the alien reflecting on their time with the humans). Had things gone differently, maybe I would have concluded that I'm a part of it. Had they gone another way, I could have maybe even more strongly identified with one culture over another. And those are the kinds of options I want the end point of the game to have. <br/><br/>If I set the game directly analogous to my own experience, it can be intensely awkward or just fall flat. Hence I decided to make it an explicit alien integrating into other humans. Give it some distance, let it be silly (but expectedly so), and then let people see what it's like to be an unofficial cultural ambassador. I don't think my experience is unique to me, it happens all the time; being the first Other that a group of insulated people have met is a fairly common experience. It's just that kind of experience that I'm trying to encapsulate and make a fun space to explore. Ya know, without it getting too real in any particular way.<br/><br/>Ok, so, bleeding heart bullshit aside <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>, any thoughts on how I can translate that concept more strongly with a better procedure?  This is part of the reason why I wanted the alien and human players to share a language: theoretically we have the tools to communicate, but our worlds are so different it can still get lost. It's also why I went with "attempt to explain" rather than "convey with action." Though I still actually prefer David's suggestion, cause I think it would make for more interesting play experience.<br/><br/>Breaking that whole analogy down, I see the necessary procedural elements as:\n<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Struggle to convey a culture using a shared lexicon (whatever that is defined as).</li><li>Bring the others to an understanding of what you mean.</li><li>Find out if their understanding maps with what you were trying to get across (and be disheartened or bolstered or in some way affected by that experience).</li><li>Determine your own place in the structure of both worlds; one way or another, you're changed by the experience, and it's up to the players to determine where it puts the alien.</li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455900/#Comment_455900" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T04:25:04+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  4:25AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post.

I would be 200% more interested in this if it made it possible to take a strong stance and decide one way or another - if this process was the point of the game. There's something quite powerful there!<br/><br/>One random idea:<br/><br/>What if, instead of one person trying to convey something alien to everyone else, it was about one person trying to fit in, trying to understand an utterly alien culture or process? You have to participate in it (an entirely alien process, in an entirely alien group) without being told what it is or how it works, only receiving feedback when (say) you get things wrong.<br/><br/>Not sure if that suits the game, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
