That's, like, ridiculous, dudes.<br/><br/>For those not yet in the know, THE BLACK SPOT is a storytelling game in which players act out the kinds of terrifying tales told in horror films like those of Sam Raimi, George A. Romero and Wes Craven. The ultimate fate of every player's character is determined via draws from a special deck of cards. Most of the rest of what happens in each story is left up to the players' imaginations. An average session of the game takes about 1 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>Lovingly,<br/>Mark                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
