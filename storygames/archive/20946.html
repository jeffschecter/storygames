It's a somewhat important term for rpg historiography, as at one time "adventure games" that were not roleplaying games, such as <i>Talisman</i> or <i>Heroquest</i>, were major elements in the hobby game market.<br/><br/>I started writing a detailed explanation about how I use this terminology, how others use the terminology, and how the answer depends on the definition of the terms, but then I realized that you have particular definitions in mind:<br/><br/><b>Story game</b>, according to Ben's post, is a roleplaying game where the players can affect play via means other than the capabilities of their characters. <b>Adventure game</b> is the opposite of that to him, it seems to me, but I understand that you just mean traditional RPGS by the term rather than Ben's analytical definition.<br/><br/>If that's really your operating definition for what the concept "story game" means (I can't say I'd be too fond of that, myself), then the answer is pretty simple: the only difference is that traditionally rpgs have featured only relatively minor ways for the non-GM players to influence events outside their player character. This is the difference by definition.<br/><br/>Note that it's not a black and white thing; few rpgs are <i>completely</i> devoid of "narrative control" features. For example, in many games that one would consider traditional, the GM has to ask permission from a player before doing certain things to their character. In <i>Champions</i>, one of the fundamental cornerstones of the tradition, players have explicit control over e.g. how the NPC supporting cast of their superhero PC is treated in the game, via labeling them as various types of resources and flaws for their character. For example, a NPC that is <i>not</i> labeled as a dependent (a type of flaw indicating that the superhero can be hooked into adventures by threatening that character) for your character is not a legitimate target for a kidnapping plot. Seems to me that <i>Champions</i> is both a traditional RPG and a story game.<br/><br/>Admittedly the answer to your question that I come up with is quite tautological: the difference between RPGs that have narrative control and those that do not is that the former has narrative control, while the latter kind does not. Some games have a little bit, so up to you to decide which box they fall into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459669/#Comment_459669" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T01:35:39+00:00" title="January 28, 2017  1:35AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have not often heard that use of "adventure game", although it makes some sense to me (with Eero's caveat). There are also many GMed/non-story-game games which don't feature mechanics to influence events other than by the means of the character (e.g. LARPs, Braunsteins, fighting games, etc).<br/><br/>To answer your larger question, though, I'd have to understand what you mean by Contemporary RPGs. There's a major gamut from D&amp;D5E to Apocalypse World to Microscope or Nordic LARP... and they all have different traditions and design features. What do you mean by 'Contemporary RPGs'? Are they, as Eero suggests, merely anything which doesn't fit the definition of "not a story game" (according to Ben)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459672/#Comment_459672" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T02:21:37+00:00" title="January 28, 2017  2:21AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2017 2:31AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><b>Story game</b>, according to Ben's post, is a roleplaying game where the players can affect play via means other than the capabilities of their characters. <b>Adventure game</b> is the opposite of that to him, it seems to me, but I understand that you just mean traditional RPGS by the term rather than Ben's analytical definition.</blockquote>\nRight, so by Adventure Game I mean exactly what Ben means. A role-playing game in which you control just your character and advocate for them via their capabilities, like the games in the 80s and 90s, or like D&amp;D 5E or games that still use that model (to me this is the same as a traditional RPG). When I say contemporary games I'm talking about games that have been innovative the last decade or two, so indie RPGs would probably be a better way to put it.  I'm asking what's the difference between adventure games and indie games? In a lot of indie games they've added mechanics that lead players contribute to the story in ways other than just controlling their character; for example, in ways, to some degree like a Story Game; which as you say, is on the opposite side of the spectrum. <b>So what I'm asking is, are there other innovations in indie games other than bringing in these story game elements,  and what specifically these innovations are?</b> This is the problem when people use terms differently; I'm using the terms how Ben defines them.

I kind of personally define a Story Game like this: <br/>a RPG is Story Game to the extent that the players have direct input collectively into what the story is about. <br/>Of course, there's a bit more to my definition; it might go something like this: <br/>A RPG is a Story Game to the degree to which the players tell a story together collaboratively, with no one having too much more control or authority than another; as opposed to, having the main goal be playing from the perspective of a single character, typically advocating for this character, and affecting the story mostly from the actions and speech of this character (i.e. "my character says this..."; my character does this...".  <br/>That's pretty much how I see it. Of course,  definition of these terms is slippery, and most of us use them in a way that is useful to us...it would be nice if we had shared definitions, so that there would be less misunderstanding\u2026but, of course, everyone has disparate opinions and are attached their own definitions...

Also, based on asking for peoples favorite RPG's and Story Games on this site,  and the games that they listed, it seems this is the way most story gamers loosely defined the terms.

It's just that these things <i>weren't acknowledged at a systemic level</i>.

Here's a short version:<br/><br/>Depending on how you look at it, task resolution and conflict resolution are either an unnecessary separation between two things which are occasionally indistinguishable and meld one into the other, or two fundamentally separate processes which are completely different at root. Like I said, tons of debate has been had on this topic over the years.<br/><br/>The old-fashioned view of RPG mechanics (I'll refer to this as "dice" from now on) is that we engage them to see how well a character carries out a certain task in the imagined space. If my character is swinging a sword, the "dice" determine how well she executes that sword swing. Then we all imagine it appropriately. Typically, some combination of rules and GM judgement then tells us what the effects are.<br/><br/>This is, roughly, task resolution. As you can see, it gives us a fictional constraint ("the character has swung her sword very poorly/with utmost skill") but otherwise tells us little about what happens next. When combined with other rules - like hit points and damage, for instance - we can get some reliable information from these "dice" (e.g. "your enemy is now dead", "the door is now open", etc), but otherwise it's just helping us describe what a given character's actions look like in our imagination.<br/><br/>Looking at dice as enabling "conflict resolution", however, is quite different. The idea here is that we establish a conflict of interests (usually in the fictional space), with two parties in opposition, who have different intentions and different desires. The dice then tell us which party predominates and overcomes their opposition. Once the opposition is overcome, this party achieves their <i>intent</i>. (Some people liked referring to conflict resolution as <i>intent resolution</i>, as they felt this was clearer.)<br/><br/>When I say "overt" conflict resolution, I mean that all of the above is clearly expressed as part of play. The most obvious form of this appears in any game with "conflict stakes". For instance, you might say, "If I win the roll, I get away with the diamonds. If you win the roll, I give in and agree to join the Empire." We have clearly identified what's at stake and what the dice mean. There's little room for disagreement after the dice have been rolled.<br/><br/>One easy way to turn task resolution into conflict resolution is to say, "Hey, why are you doing that? What do you hope to achieve?", and then have a success manifest that result. A lot of people who play "traditional RPGs" do this, but many also do not. This is an example of the two concepts overlapping.<br/><br/>Quite notably, you'll see that task resolution does not lend itself well to other situations. For example, what if I, Paul, disagree with you, Jeff, about the game we're playing? A "Rope Use" check isn't going to help us. We need other tools. Conflict resolution, however, can be used to settle disagreements between players, factions, immaterial forces, and other questions, which means that suddenly designers could use their existing mechanics to create new ways of relating to each other at the table. This opens up the scope of game design dramatically.<br/><br/>For example, My Life with Master really popularized another innovation: the formal ENDGAME. Most RPGs did not have a formal endgame; however, in My Life with Master, the outcomes of character actions and scene outcomes all contribute to funneling the game towards one of several predetermined endings. Hopefully, it's easy to see how this kind of design can't really come into being without the idea of conflict resolution.<br/><br/>So, here are three basic innovations you can look at (the third, I believe, doesn't require explanation for you):<br/><br/>1. Conflict Resolution<br/>2. Formal Endgame<br/>3. Scene Framing<br/><br/>(Hopefully I don't have to mention that conflict resolution isn't strictly an *improvement* on task resolution. They're just different tools. For example, task resolution may better for a game where you want to emphasize uncertainty, discovery, and a sense of "virtual reality". Its drawbacks, in that setting, contribute to the game rather than detracting from it.<br/><br/>There are also interesting hybrid models. For example, in <i>Apocalypse World</i>, the process of task resolution - the "dice" are linked to discrete character actions - is combined with explicit outcomes [in the lists to choose from] to create conflict resolution in many instances. In <i>The Pool</i>, the dice could be engaged as a form of task resolution [the game text isn't entirely clear on what the dice actually 'mean'], but the Monologue of Victory allows the player to always turn any successful roll into conflict resolution via their narration.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459761/#Comment_459761" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-30T20:19:23+00:00" title="January 30, 2017  8:19PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And then we decided we couldn't (always?) tell the difference between conflict resolution and task resolution, or define the difference.

I think there is a bit more wisdom about what is worth dedicating rules to and what isn't (don't see many polearm hit-modifiers these days), but many individual features that might be viewed as innovations seem to be community specific and never really spread to the larger body of RPGs.<br/><br/>One recurring fashion I am glad exists today--albeit that exists in a few different forms--is the notion of "selective randomization". That is, the idea that in a system that routinely uses random resolution, there are times that the system eschews randomization when the designer is aware that doing so would not be the best for the flow of the game. Frex:<br/><br/>- In D&amp;D 3e/D20, "taking 10" and "taking 20" when there is no consequence for failure and the PC has unlimited time to perform the task,<br/>- In Gumshoe, investigative abilities don't require rolls (or expenditure of resources) if the GM/designer recognizes that the ability would allow the game to progress.<br/>- In Burning Empires/Wheel, "say yes or roll the dice" hopes to only resort to randomization if the contest or conflict is interesting. (Less charitably, I see the rule as the designer fuming at bad GMing, but the upside is still there.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459781/#Comment_459781" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-31T19:36:46+00:00" title="January 31, 2017  7:36PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Say Yes or Roll the Dice is absolutely Luke fuming at bad GMing, largely his own.

(Lady Blackbird, Apocalypse World, "the Mountain Witch Trick")<br/><br/>* Explicit single-session games (often with a procedure for playing with no prep - e.g. Fiasco) <i>[Earlier in RPG history, games overwhelmingly assumed you'd be playing for an indefinite period of time, or, alternatively, purchasing a pre-written scenario - although these would also tend to be written with more than one session of play in mind.]<br/></i><br/>* "Rich" resolution, or nuanced outcomes. More and more games are including mechanics which do not simply offer "succeed/fail" as the possible outcomes, but various means of creating "mixed" outcomes, partial success, and so on. I'd say Vincent Baker has been responsible for a lot of innovation in this area, and Apocalypse World has made it particularly popular outside "indie" circles.<br/><br/>* Generally, a willingness to adopt a variety of tools into roleplaying design, from freeform techniques to boardgame-style design, has become more and more visible since the inception of the "indie" movement. Games aren't assumed to feature dice, stats, skills, a full-page character sheet, and an adventure created or bought by the GM anymore.<br/><br/>* Attempts at "pick up and play" games, or designs which can be played "right away". (Most older games assumed the presence of a GM who knew the rules and would explain them to the other players.) <i>[I think we still have a long way to go here, however.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459887/#Comment_459887" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-04T16:18:50+00:00" title="February  4, 2017  4:18PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite a lot of the design innovations Paul (and others) has been listing is also in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Otherkind</span> (Vincent Baker).

I don't know every game out there (not even close, really), but it does seem like a benchmark indie roleplaying game (rather than story game).  Or maybe it's something different.  Based on your two definitions, Jeff, it is a kind of hybrid: as, I see it, you're definitely playing a character and advocating from that position, but you have a huge amount of possible narrative control/creative input that extends well beyond character actions and speech and into the setting/world and narrative direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

(Very useful in some gaming environments.)<br/><br/>* The use of dramatic Premise for game design and play technique. (This is a shorthand for identifying dramatic questions which are then addressed by play; it's been used in a lot of game designs, but also in various bits of play advice and tools for addressing topics in adventure writing, character design, GM decisions, and so forth.)<br/><br/>* The notion of character "Flags", and using those to inform play and GM decisions. (Some very powerful tools and technology have emerged from this!)<br/><br/>* As somewhat of an example of that thinking, we have new game designs which merge character concerns, pre-set by the game, with player input. A perfect and famous example is Apocalypse World's "playbooks". They are at once character creation, character role "pregens", and yet also serve to define the fictional world, the nature of action that takes place within it, and what kind of concerns the players will be dealing with in play.<br/><br/>In other words, the idea that the presence of a character or character type informs what the game will be *about*, as opposed to a more traditional view of play where there is a "party of adventurers", an "adventure plot", and some way to get the former to engage in the latter (railroading, plot hooks, game rewards, etc).<br/><br/>* The idea of games engaging individual character storylines, as opposed to a group acting in concert, became more visible or more popular, with games dealing with individual storylines, many-players-one-character-play, players in opposition to one another, and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459996/#Comment_459996" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T19:15:17+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  7:15PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2017 3:51AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Jeff, I actually disagree with the notion that in traditional RPGs players other than the GM only contribute to the fiction through the characters they portray. Historically, there's always been shared world-building in RPGs as well as moment-to-moment contributions of all sorts, by all players, not all of them fitting within the narrow "play your character" box... It's just that these things <i>weren't acknowledged at a systemic level</i>. Whether they were acknowledged as a social level or were an invisible, immediately-edited-away-despite-listenened-to part of the conversation varied with local play cultures. Acknowledging these contributions at a systemic level was one of the big paradigm shifts in RPG design...<br/>This is number 1 reason I'm not in love with your RPG/Story Game divide, BTW: I believe such a distinction to be mostly illusory. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nSure, how much input a player has regarding in-game, non-character focused, story/world-building is highly dependent upon your local play culture...and there may be instances where players contribute more to the story than just from their character's actions and perspective...but to say the distinction is mostly illusory is just something I can't agree with. To me there is a big difference between the two types of games (i.e. SG/RPG (using my definitions))...yes, these differences exist on a continuum and there are a lot of games with mixed elements...yes, there are a lot of games and elements of games that these terms don't describe (for example, GMfull)...but collaborative games in which all players coauthor what happens in all aspects of the story full-cloth (like Fiasco and Follow) are very different from single GM Adventure RPGs (like D&amp;D) where the GM is largely responsible for the story and the players mostly contribute  from the perspective of their characters...maybe the players, as you say, contribute more than that to a greater or lesser extent, but there are real, fundamental differences IMO...I can go into why I think so, if you are interested in talking more about the subject <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> this is definitely not to say one type of game is better than another or that they're both not role-playing games just there different ...and I may very well be completely misunderstanding what you're  actually saying and missed the point completely <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460004/#Comment_460004" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T20:45:10+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  8:45PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, historically, there were a lot of games on the one end of a sort of spectrum, and the Forge came along and a bunch of people invented a lot of games on the other end of that spectrum. Sure, there were always games that used some of the techniques the Forge clarified (very little was <i>invented</i> at the Forge; more stuff was, I think, discovered, distilled, clarified, and isolated).<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way--probably because Forge people frequented Story Games--the term "story game" started to mean "Forge game" even though I'm pretty sure it was originally used to mean "all those games, even D&amp;D, even Dogs in the Vineyard," to avoid a lot of the "what is an RPG?" arguments.<br/><br/>After 2005, you started seeing a lot of games that sat in the middle more. Indie folks, now mollified with games that solved particular problems they had with gaming in general, went back and revisited the old classics. When the OSR picked up, a bunch of Forge types revisited old D&amp;D texts and played a lot of OSR stuff. Mike Mearls dabbled in Forge stuff and he got the peanut butter in the chocolate, too, and you saw some of that in D&amp;D 4E and his own projects before that.<br/><br/>Now the "traditional" vs. "indie" vs. "story game" divide isn't so clean and it really doesn't matter much anymore.

I think that collaborative storytelling games are different from GM/PC dynamic games...although they are both role-playing games of course, and both awesome :-)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460019/#Comment_460019" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T12:19:38+00:00" title="February  7, 2017 12:19PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2017 12:22PM by Rafu.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, no...

Again, the terms are only used for convenience and I'm basically just looking at games that are toward one pole or another and more less fit the terminology. \n<blockquote><br/>This is why I always use the term "story game" in the original spirit it was intended: as an umbrella term for games of the imagination, as a way to explain that you like both D&amp;D and Fiasco.<br/></blockquote>\nI get this, but the reason I use the Story Game term the way I do is because it is a catchy term, and an easy way to distinguish the different type of games for my group-- being that they play an Indie RPG one week and a Story Game the next week. I could call my group "Indie RPGs and Collaborative Storytelling Games," but it's not as concise and doesn't have the same ring; of course, maybe something like 'collaborative storytelling games'  would be a better term to use on Story-Games.com ... what term would you use for Fiasco and Follow type games, if you thought a term would be useful for you?\n<blockquote><br/>I can say this, though:<br/><br/>It seems to me that the "other" end of spectrum is a very real thing.

Are you saying that a Story Game can be totally pure in this sense; in other words, be completely on one side of the spectrum. Or are you saying, that it is better for Story Games not to have one embody a character and make decisions from their perspective? Or are you saying something else?\n<blockquote><br/>Is there any reason to believe that the "other end" of the spectrum (pure storytelling) is similarly ambiguous?<br/></blockquote>\nAre you saying that whereas a RPG can never be wholly about playing only as a character,  a Story Game  on the other hand could be wholly  about storytelling. \n<blockquote><br/><br/>I really think all of us basically agree but we're just not understanding that from our communications for some reason. <br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460073/#Comment_460073" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T04:33:54+00:00" title="February  9, 2017  4:33AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In terms of terminology, I personally like to call them all "story games".<br/><br/>Some story games are RPGs.

For example, many larps don't have scene framing - the players just stay in-character and in-scene for the entire event. (Some games utilize the "cage" device for this - such as a larp where everyone is locked inside a particular room.) <br/><br/>I was in a spontaneous freeform larp at my first Knutepunkt where we collectively created characters who were children in a scout expedition, and we played out a game that was just them walking and talking and playing in the snow. It was done as an example of collective creating and organizing, so it isn't the norm - but it was still fun.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460104/#Comment_460104" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T23:28:09+00:00" title="February  9, 2017 11:28PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I question the use of "narrative control". Some posters tend to break things up into control through in-character action (associated with "traditional"), and control through out-of-character mechanics (associated with "story games" or "indie games"). <br/><br/>However, I have to say - that my freeform, GMless, mechanicless collectively-organized larp at Knutepunkt was very very far from a traditional RPG, while also having the least out-of-character control. <br/><br/>A tabletop game I particularly like is Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks, which is traditional in the sense of mechanics through in-character action, but non-traditional in terms of situation.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
