He advertised for players in local game shops and clubs. The event lasted for over a year and was divided into a small set of adventures. You signed up and submitted a preference list for the adventure slot you wanted, being provided with the game system to be used and an exceedingly basic summary (pitch, basically) of what the adventure would be about. My dim memory provides this list of game systems used:<br/>- Teenagers From Outer Space<br/>- Chivalry and Sorcery<br/>- Call of Cthulhu<br/>- Justice Incorporated<br/>- Champions<br/>- Classic Traveller<br/>- Aftermath<br/>- Space Opera<br/><br/>There were a few others, I believe. The campaign inhabited the same setting and each adventure was loosely connected to the events of previous ones: there was an over-arcing story to the whole thing. I played in the Call of Cthulhu and Aftermath adventures, although I really wanted to be in the Chivalry and Sorcery and Space Opera ones.<br/><br/>The GM who mounted the whole thing did it specifically to (a) widen his circle of gaming acquaintances, (b) try out game systems he'd wanted to play but hadn't yet, and (c) act as a sort of general promotion of the hobby (i.e. demonstrate to the community that there were more games to play than just D&amp;D).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kfitzpatrick" title="kfitzpatrick"><img alt="kfitzpatrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kfitzpatrick">kfitzpatrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248816/#Comment_248816" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T07:54:53+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  7:54AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">@viktor_haag</a> that's pretty much exactly what I was thinking of.
