I'm not particularly experienced with RPGs (used to play D&amp;D and Warhammer back in the day), so I was expecting a traditional game in which there was a clearly defined "mission" or objective which the gameplay revolved around and there were clear winners and losers (characters who died, got fewer experience points, etc.). Instead, the game seemed to be more of an exercise in collaborative storytelling, with the players and the "gamemaster" working together to create an engaging narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the game is war-based, we first decided what conflict we'd be playing within and settled upon the Vietnam War. Then we the players were asked to create our characters, who were not given stats (like hit points, etc.) but instead personalities and backgrounds that might be relevant during game play. Once we'd finished with our characters the gamemaster started play, which was turn-based...I can't remember all of the ins and outs of each turn (more on that below), but they were based on initiative and luck, rather than skill...whoever had more of those attributes had more power/ability to shape how the narrative proceded.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bare bones of the situation was that our characters were a couple of low-level army guys working on a base in Saigon just as the city was in the process of being overrun. We witnessed a local boy we knew well being roughly interrogated by a couple other American soldiers, and decided to intervene. The boy's brother also came running over and got involved. Just as a full-blown fight was breaking out, the base was attacked by the Viet Cong and everyone was forced to scramble for cover, and one of the characters was seriously injured. Unfortunately, that's about as far as we got as our time was limited that evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I found most interesting about the game was the non-confrontational relationship between the gm and the players...rather than trying to thwart the characters or make things as difficult as possible for them, it seemed like his focus was simply to make the experience interesting, with lots of narrative twists and turns. The main complaint I had about it was that it seemed to have a pretty steep learning curve, with lots of non-intuitive procedural points that had to be explained to us as we went along (and which I am hard pressed to remember at this point), which led to a bit of confusion and delay. I'd imagine that issue would resolve itself once you've played a couple of times.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118893/#Comment_118893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T20:33:28+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  8:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: yvesperret</cite><br/>The thing I found most interesting about the game was the non-confrontational relationship between the gm and the players...rather than trying to thwart the characters or make things as difficult as possible for them, it seemed like his focus was simply to make the experience interesting, with lots of narrative twists and turns.</blockquote>\nThat sounds kinda cool.

There wasn't a sense that he was trying to "beat" us or "win" the game or that we had to do the same to him. I enjoyed the interaction between my character and the other guy's...knowing his background and personality made him seem like more of a fleshed-out person than just a series of stats or a traditional alignment (good, evil, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my character, I sort of tried to make him as much like me as possible, personality-wise...just an ordinary guy caught up in extraordinary events, trying to ride out the war and keep himself in one piece. One thing I liked about the game was that the background and personality you gave your character were more important to the gameplay than randomly-determined categories ("Strength", "Intelligence", etc.), and you were rewarded for acting in ways that were in keeping with your character's past and personality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118973/#Comment_118973" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T10:58:23+00:00" title="January 10, 2008 10:58AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey yvesperret (Aside to story-games: I'm just respecting privacy here, I <em>know</em> my player's name!),</p>\n<p>I've got a question for you.

Ok, let me try to rephrase.</p>\n<p>Within the fiction, bad shit happened to the characters.

The MPs were involved, as were some bully-type soldiers on the base.</p>\n<p>Now, I was responsible for a fair bit of that.</p>\n<p>However, there were times when you (the players) lost a roll <em>and</em> I chose to spend (which meant that you narrated).  That meant that you guys were responsible for describing how things got worse for the Protagonists.  I believe that their goal was to get Vin out of the way of a VC attack in time to save him -- he'd already been strafed by a MIG, if memory serves.</p>\n<p>That's what I'm talking about.  What was that like?  How did narrating your own adversity make you feel?  What worked about it?  What didn't?  How did the way the spending (like, "2 Horror and 1 Valour") interract with the narration?  Did narrating adversity work better or worse than narrating victory?</p>\n<p>D</p>\n<p>[edited for minor grammar on Jan 14]</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yvesperret" title="yvesperret"><img alt="yvesperret" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yvesperret">yvesperret</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119493/#Comment_119493" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T13:45:28+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  1:45PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, narrating adversity was interesting...I wouldn't say it worked "better" or "worse" than victory.
