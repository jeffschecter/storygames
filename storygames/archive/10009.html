Old folks might have trouble manipulating (or reading) dice or cards, too.<br><br>The other problem is psycho-social.  The old folks homes I've been in are <i>horrifically</i> depressing.  While everyone's circumstances are different, in any particular gaming group there'd be a pretty good chance of someone grieving over the recent loss of a friend or spouse, someone else who feels neglected by their kids, someone who's feeling depressed about what they're life has boiled down to, and someone with issues with the nurses/management.  Playing Nut-Ball with seniors strikes me as exceedingly reckless.  (As I believe Paul said, these are dangerous games.)  <br><br>So it would have to be a game that's fun, easy to remember, doesn't require fine motor skills, and doesn't involve face-stabbing.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222122/#Comment_222122" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T19:23:37+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  7:23PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2009 7:25PM by C_Edwards.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread puts me in mind of the "Kick the Can" segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played rpgs with many non-seniors who should have never been introduced to roleplaying.

We did, it took about an hour (it was late and folks needed to get to bed), it engaged almost everyone, and it was good.<br>\n<br>\nFor my own style of story gaming and design, I have been finding more success with folks who have no exposure to story games than with veterans with all their preconceptions.<br>\n<br>\nI would guess that, in order to reach older folks as a demographic (or most folks in the general population, for that matter) effectively with story game, you will have to think about how to move away from many of the aspects that make this a specialized niche. "Mechanics", focus on conflict, mandatory edgy play... these things often drive away the uninitiated, and would almost certainly drive away almost all elderly people.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222517/#Comment_222517" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T16:25:24+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  4:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And if you do decide to move forward with something like this from the research angle, feel free to hit me up as a psychologist in this field as I am currently working on pioneering empirically experimental therapeutic interventions using collaborative storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223211/#Comment_223211" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T10:56:16+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 10:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2009 10:57AM by Joe_Beason.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ramble, probably in ways nothing to do with the OP's intent:<br><br><i>it strikes me that all Story Games are pretty much designed for people age 25-35.</i><br><br>Uh-oh.  I'm 42. Anybody want to buy a collection of games?  Or maybe I'm young for my age!  (Or just immature?)<br><br>If the upper bound is 35, then you can also ask the question, "Are you designing games for middle-aged people."  And if the games really are designed for 25-35 year olds, then I imagine lots of y'all are in that age range, which makes me wonder, "Are you designing games for your parents?"  Do any of you play these games with your parents, or older relatives?  What would you do if someone's Uncle Buck came along to a game night, or a con?<br><br>A friend of mine who's about 60 looooves going to GenCon.  He's into board games and collectible card games.  In passing I mentioned how I was trying to game more, but that the folks that hang out at the game store just seem so damned young.  He expressed his feeling that he's become an "old man" at the Con, that when he walks up to a group of younger people playing a game, he can sense them drawing away rather than being welcoming.<br><br>Of course, it's not just in gaming that divides people by age.  Outside of family, we in the US tend to retreat into our own age brackets.  The interesting questions for me are "Will you be designing games when you're a senior?" or "Do seniors design games?"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223232/#Comment_223232" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T11:46:10+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 11:46AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My short answer: I am actively designing a game for my 65+ year old father.

I had the very misguided notion that she'd like a system that was very freeform with no rules. I pitched a system to her. She immediately started throwing in rules that she thought would be fun, and wanted some stuff simply based around mathematical coolness. So, strangely, it might be D&amp;D. Except, the idea of killing things really bothers her. She's a Star Trek fan, but playing Klingon Honour Guard really bothered her, she wanted a non-killing solution (go figure, most Star Trek solutions don't involve violence) Descent (the computer game) she had no qualms about, since you're blowing up robots, but it made her motion sick. So the trick would be to have a mentally stimulating game with a fairly complex set of rules where you can go on adventures and not kill anyone. Or something which is completely satyrised (Paranoia maybe?)<br><br>This would be very fun to develop anyway, because most systems have incredibly complex rules for combat, but not much else.<br><br/>Off hand I really want to play shock: social science fiction with her, and I think it's a game that could be pitched to almost any sci fi fan. There's actually a lot of people I want to try to play it with. I think A Dirty World could work too, simply because there aren't any specific mechanics for combat or killing people (you can die, but it's sort of a side rule and could be taken out), so it could be entirely eliminated and still be equally fun (whereas D&amp;D without combat is freeform roleplaying). I haven't played Paranoia, but the whole setting is absurd, you end up dying a lot (6 clones) so I think it could be fun in that aspect.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224613/#Comment_224613" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T20:24:32+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  8:24PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blue</cite>And for the record, James, I will be 40 in less than a year and have been really only been playing and working in the Story Game 'thought space' for 4-5 years.
