There are things I want to respond to or ask questions about etc. <br/><br/>But maybe it's already been addressed below.   <br/><br/>So a reader (read: me) has two options:  <br/>1). scroll way down to the end of the post and comment. This may be rendered redundant by all the intervening posts that have accumulated. You might be just cluttering the conversation strand with annoying repetitions. <br/> <br/>Or<br/><br/>2). read through all of the branching pathways the conversation takes. All of these pathways are channelized by the format into one tangled dreadlocks of a strand. All mixed together...  difficult to hold in mind simultaneously. <br/><br/>Since I don't have the cognitive bandwidth to track all the staggered and asynchronous conversations simultaneously, and I don't have the patience or the time to read and take pen and paper notes to remind myself about what comments I want to make when I get to the end of the strand, I go with the quick scroll mostly. But it's a crummy way to communicate. I end up feeling badly about it. <br/><br/>Someone worked hard to make this site and it's a truly awesome thing.  Thank you!!!<br/><br/>but I've noticed that the way commenting works in Facebook groups handles this challenge soooooo much more effectively.   <br/><br/>I do appreciate the independent status of this site...  and the fact that it seems to attract great people, unlike some Facebook groups can be...  I'm not suggesting everything moves to Facebook. Heaven forfend!!  <br/><br/>Anyway,  thanks for all the good conversation. I'm happy this place exists. I plan to continue to hang out here as much as possible                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466668/#Comment_466668" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T17:29:07+00:00" title="September 29, 2017  5:29PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like the issue you are describing is that it's tough to jump into a long discussion thread without reading the whole thing.

I'd say it's because the forum medium is good enough to hold onto its niche for now. Nobody's put in the work to really take it to the next level that I know of. (I imagine the next level is something that supplements the concept of a "thread" in various ways, so as to facilitate a conversation web, all without compromising on the linear simplicity of the existing paradigm.)<br/><br/>The reason why an old-fashioned forum (of which the Vanilla software is actually a pretty recent iteration) is not going to be superceded by social media style stuff is likely that it supports long-winded essay style communications better. As has often been remarked here, the people still hanging out at SG seem to often be doing that because they dislike the ephemeral bleating that's so natural to the fast-paced world of the social media communities.

In this forum's case, the default language is simple HTML - you write raw HTML markup in the comment box, and assuming it's not one of the security-limited tags you're using, it should show up just as on any web page.<br/><br/>For example, a quote box is produced on this forum software by using the &lt;blockquote&gt; tag. You can see an example of what a quote box looks like as html markup code by clicking the "Quote" link on any post, which then copies that entire post inside blockquote tags into the comment writing box.<br/><br/>However, what you put inside that box is arbitrary, you don't need to be limited to just quoting a whole post! You can easily go into that text inside the box and chop it up, just like I did when I quoted that one part of your post. I simply removed the parts that I did not want to quote.<br/><br/>You can also use this method to create quotations from whatever other text material, it doesn't have to be from the particular thread. For example, here's me quoting from Dracula the novel, because I like it:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bram Stoker" rel="nofollow">Bram Stoker</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or \u201cwynds,\u201d as they call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed. Before falling asleep she asked\u2014even implored\u2014me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her mother\u2019s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted\u2014nay, infallibly would\u2014in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....</p></div></blockquote>\nI hope that clarified that. You can do all sorts of things to cheer up your posts with simple HTML - insert images, lists, tables, various text effects. It's well worth the effort to learn some HTML even if you're not into programming and web site design per se; it's one of the basic building blocks of our modern environment, and as you can see, it pops up in places.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466685/#Comment_466685" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T21:21:26+00:00" title="September 29, 2017  9:21PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seem to remember that it was possible to select part of a post and then quote just that.

If Vanilla's built at all like other forums and content management systems I've seen, the actual change would be basic - just a function to count the number of discrete participants in the thread, and a reference to the result in the page template. Maybe save the count somewhere - presumably you'd want to do the same thing the software does with the other thread metadata, whatever it is.<br/><br/>It can be said that in general we live in an initial stage of the information age where the number of things that <i>could</i> be done vastly surpasses the number of proficient and dedicated coders. This holds pretty much for all areas of life, excepting perhaps video game studios, which seem to often have more coders than good ideas [grin]. This means that many ideas fall into the category of things that could be done in principle, but nobody bothers to do them because everybody has better things to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466734/#Comment_466734" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-01T15:08:12+00:00" title="October  1, 2017  3:08PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2017 3:08PM by James_Stuart.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero\u2019s correct: it\u2019s technically easy but still effort to package it well.

It could be used to discuss some stuff privately as a PM or avoid spamming another thread when small side-discussions erupted. Sadly, it got removed when Vanilla was implemented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
