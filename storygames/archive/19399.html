I just ran my first session of Lady Blackbird earlier tonight, and the website says that the price of admission is posting about the experience on Story Games, so here I go. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The game began, as is its wont, in a holding cell. The captain of the <i>Owl</i>, Cyrus Vance, had been led away to a separate location on the <i>Hand of Sorrow</i>, but his crew and passengers had been taken to the brig. His fate remained unknown. Naomi Bishop apologized to Lady Blackbird for allowing the Imperials to capture them, but Snargle explained that their skyship would've gotten away if the Sonic Tetryon Singularity Containment Field hadn\u2019t collapsed like that.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird explained that they needed a distraction, and Naomi delivered one to her in spades. Using her almost superhuman strength, she broke through the bars of their cell and commenced to fighting the two guards in the corridor beyond. One she pummeled into submission, and the other tried to blow an alarm whistle. She was far too quick for him, though, and slapped the whistle from his hand before it could reach his lips. The young marine, Ivan Bell, was revealed to be a conscript who had no fight in him. When he asked them to spare his life, they graciously did so and then conscripted him into their own little army. He grudgingly agreed to their terms.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird then disguised herself in the defeated guard's uniform, and they hatched a plan to have her and Ivan lead them out of the detention area, claiming that they had received orders over the ship's intercom to move the prisoners to another location for interrogation. Natasha did her best to bluff her way past them, but in an ill turn of fate, she tripped over her ill-fitting trousers and her helmet fell off, revealing her to be a woman. One of the guards managed to sound the alarm throughout the ship before he and his compatriot were overborne through a combination of Lady Blackbird and Kale Arkam's combined magical power. As a repayment for his actions, however, Ms. Bishop nearly twisted his head off, breaking his neck.<br/><br/>Ivan had told them earlier that their equipment was taken to the ship's armory for storage, where it was guarded by six men-at-arms. The entrance to the armory was very near to that of the detention area, so under the cover of his own darkness spell, which billowed along with them on the breeze of Natasha's magic, Kale attempted to pick the electric lock of the heavily reinforced door. Sadly, he did not account for the distortions in the electric field that were produced as a side-effect of Natasha's Stormblood powers, and he was promptly electrocuted by the lock. Ivan managed to knock him free, saving him from certain death, but as he lay there injured on the hallway floor, surrounding by the swirling, inky blackness of his own magic, Kale could hear the thump, thump, thump of approaching, iron-shod boots...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431939/#Comment_431939" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T12:45:36+00:00" title="May  1, 2014 12:45PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like fun!<br/><br/>How long was your session?<br/><br/>Did you play any refreshment scenes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anduwaithe" title="Anduwaithe"><img alt="Anduwaithe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anduwaithe">Anduwaithe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431976/#Comment_431976" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T09:04:36+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  9:04AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it was a lot of fun!

The escaped prisoners and the prison guard that they had recruited made it through and relocked the door just in the nick of time. To their surprise, the six guards said to have been posted inside were nowhere to be seen. Lady Blackbird attempted to use her magic to teleport the captain of the <i>Hand of Sorrow</i> to the armory. Unfortunately, her spell misfired, and she instead teleported <i>The Owl</i>'s captain to them. Cyrus Vance had been tortured for information by the Imperials, and died in Kale's arms.<br/><br/>It turns out the armory's guards had withdrawn into a secret compartment adjacent thereto, equipped with hatches facing into it and from which they could open fire at the intruders. Shortly after Cyrus' death, they launched their surprise attack. Unfortunately, they did not know of Naomi's unfathomable strength, with which she tore a hole through the wall and made her way into the secret compartment. She soon made short work of the Imperials therein. Snargle discovered a secret passage leading down a long, narrow hallway and into the captain's cabin, which was currently empty. Kale, feeling much refreshed after talking with Naomi during their escape, managed to picked the lock on a chest there, discovering a valuable-looking ruby that he quickly pocketed.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird, still angry from a fight with some prison guards earlier, tore up a valuable coat-of-arms hanging on the wall of the captain's cabin, and altered his navigational charts so as to confuse him and facilitate their eventual escape. Snargle noted that the cabin was several decks directly above the hangar bay at the rear of the ship, so it would be a simple matter of climbing out the window and using his claws and gliding ability to reach the hangar from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">out</span>side of the ship, avoiding any guards posted on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span>side of the ship.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird decided to accompany him on this journey, using clothes, bedsheets, and scavenged pieces of wood to fashion makeshift kites large enough to serve as hang-gliders for her and the other humans. Unfortunately, her and Naomi's kites were caught in wind currents that blew them off-course and away from the ship, but Kale managed to fly after them and use a length of rope to guide them back to the ship. Ivan, the guard that they had recruited, thought better of using his glider, and opted to zip-line his way down to the hangar using Kale's rope.<br/><br/>As they boarded the unguarded <i>Owl</i>, Ivan was officially welcomed to the crew of ship. As the skyship sped out of the hangar, her Ladyship fired its gun turret at the <i>Hand of Sorrow</i>'s engines, which erupted in a cloud of fire and black smoke.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432650/#Comment_432650" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-14T22:15:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2014 10:15PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice!
