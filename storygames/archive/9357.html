(I can think of many games that claim to be designed to run with no prep, but for me, IAWA is the only one I can think of where this is literally true).<br/><br/>The game went well, everyone enjoyed it, but we ran across a situation I didn't quite handle well.<br/><br/>In addition to myself, there were three players, two of whom are down with story/hippie games (I play in a Burning Wheel campaign with them), and one of whom, Colin, is definitely more of a tradiational, D&amp;D, let's-just-kill-orcs kind of player.<br/><br/>He enjoyed the game too, but at one point, when his character had come off the worse in a conflict, I suggested they could negotiate an alternate outcome, rather than have him lose dice. He was into that, and offered to have his character give up the location of the noble house signatory ring [read: MacGuffin], which John, the other player, agreed to, since that's what the conflict was about anyway.<br/><br/>However, John's next move was to move the scene to the location Colin had given him for the ring, only to have Colin announce that he'd been lying, and his character had the ring all along. Ha za!<br/><br/>So, not a big game-ending deal .. everyone is friends, there was some joking about Colin "cheating", and we moved on.<br/><br/>I was at a loss as to how to resolve this at the time, though. I knew Colin wasn't totally on board with the "It's cool if the players know what's up, even if the characters don't" way of thinking, and some context clues led me to believe that the negotiated outcome might not be "true".<br/><br/>The rules-as-written, as lovely as they are, do not offer any guidance for using in-fiction trades in exchange for mechanical damage when negotiating fallout (ie - "Okay, keep your 'Directly' dice, but your guy has to let my guy escape with the magic hat"), at least in the sense of those fictional offers being binding.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207434/#Comment_207434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T15:58:31+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  3:58PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2009 3:59PM by Jesse.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, Colin broke the rules, flat out.<br/><br/>Negotiations from conflict resolution are not done in character.

The ring he has is a fake and he has inadvertantly given the enemy a clue to finding the real ring.<br/><br/>This is a bit of a farce, but does fit the rules and the deal.  It also sets Colin's PC in a bad situation where he looks like he rolled over on his allies, when he thought he was being clever.<br/><br/>That being said, all that is a bit passive-aggressive in dealing with a "bad form" play issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207529/#Comment_207529" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T00:44:21+00:00" title="May 15, 2009 12:44AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2009 12:47AM by noclue.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have just turned to Colin and said, That's awesome!

But, as you say, since it does refer to agreements between players, rather than characters, the binding nature can be inferred.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I should have probably insisted that Colin take the exhaustion/injury dice loss when the truth about the ring changed.

("Ah ha!

Its hard to tell from Vincent's response, but he may be commenting on the whole idea of negotiating something that will occur later, rather than commenting on the "if I do X anyway, I take dice." Its not clear though. Vincent will probably come along soon and clear it up...<br/><br/>I like the idea of the negotiation being a contract and if either player reneges, it voids the deal. But there is something to be said for just allowing the social contract to self correct this behavior. Brian, let me ask you, how many times do you think someone can get away with going back on their negotiations? The next time he loses at dice he's going to be all "wait! How bout if..." And the other player's going to go "Don't insult me.

Self-correcting behavior.<br/><br/>But I suspect this particular group might not play IAWA again anytime soon, and this is definitely my go-to game for a quick session with a group of people who don't really game, or who don't game together often; it's the ideal one-shot game for me. My reason for posing the question was to see what others thought, since I can imagine encountering this problem again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207769/#Comment_207769" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T04:05:05+00:00" title="May 17, 2009  4:05AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2009 4:06AM by NomdePlume.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>I like the idea of the negotiation being a contract and if either player reneges, it voids the deal.

When players see one player act like this, and appear to get away with it, the whole group may start to distrust the negotiation element of resolving conflicts. So you end up with people tending to just accept the exhaust or injury option, and conflicts become less interesting. <br/>Far better in my view to openly declare this was a mistake, so the group understands how it was meant to work for the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
