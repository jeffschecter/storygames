I realise that it's probably not the most ideal game for that kind of set up, but that's what we're going to be doing.<br/><br/>I'm a little concerned that without the Hx from other PCs, advancement might be a little out of kilter from normal.  Does anyone have any advice or ideas how to deal with that, or should I just get over it and play already?<br/><br/>Cheers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394690/#Comment_394690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T17:03:25+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  5:03PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that'll throw advancement out of whack. In my experience people get one experience from Hx every, like, three or four sessions.<br/><br/>With one PC, they are likely to get more than the average experience per session simply because no one else but they are the focus.<br/><br/>Have you thought about the player controlling two characters? It's by the book, and it's probably how I'd do it if I ran it 1-on-1. In any case, I think you'll be fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cryiron" title="Cryiron"><img alt="Cryiron" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cryiron">Cryiron</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394691/#Comment_394691" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T17:15:10+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  5:15PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am also looking at running a one-on-one AW simply because there is a lack of interest in the game for local players and my roommate wants to play.

Just use the guidelines in the advanced fuckery section for having Hx with NPCs (and the associated help/interfere rules). You have to make your triangles a little more oblique than normal, considering that there are two NPCs vying for the one PC's resources, but that's OK. Just ask lots of provocative questions as normal and re-incorporate like crazy.<br/><br/>Its tiring. Slow down a piece, cause once the snowball starts, the tendency is to frame scenes hard to get at the drama you both want. This is good, but it can be great just languidly enjoying colour scenes and building up your rather intimate two person vision of your apocalypse world.<br/><br/>If your player plays with two PCs, put them in situations where their wants are at odds. Make the ugly choice between the two characters, make the hard bargain sacrificing one character's ambition for the other.<br/><br/>Have fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394699/#Comment_394699" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T18:49:00+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  6:49PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just posted a hack involving Strings from Monsterhearts for AW, specially for the solo game I'm running.
