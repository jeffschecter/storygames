                    There's a group in Edinburgh called the Open Roleplaying community which exists to bring new blood into the hobby and give a place where younger gamers can flourish. All ages are represented, but the vast majority are under 18. So, I was wondering they would take to Dogs, their previous experience being mainly in the realm of D&amp;D and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
So last Saturday, I pitched up and sat down with 6 players. Only one was over 20, the average age being about 15 - 16. <br/>
<br/>
Character Creation<br/>
<br/>
My concerns abut running a game like Dogs for such a young group vanished during character creation. They really got in to it, developing their characters as they went along, collaboratively exchanging thoughts and ideas. For most of them, this was something new. Ideas were flying around, realationships between the characters were created and conflicts already began to take shape. One player knew that the other characters would be taking a dislike to Brother Damien, but he loved it! <br/>
<br/>
Play<br/>
<br/>
Due to time constraints, the game itself only lasted about 90 minutes, but what a whirlwind of conflict and good roleplaying! The 6 dogs arrived at night, in a rainstorm at the township of Broken Oak, a previously Faithful-only settlement, now overcome by settlers from the East.<br/>
<br/>
So the party split. Two immediately went to the only bar in town, determined to show the incomers that this place was firmly under the rule of the King of Life. Lets put it this way, they were made to feel less than welcome. Sitting themselves down at a table of card players, they produced a holy book and immediately began to berate the gamblers for their sinful ways. Needless to say, the card players were not happy at this and one of their leaders immediately started behaving in an antagonistic fashion. The conflict went brilliantly, with one player taking the lead and the the other acting in a supporting role. The book was spat on and eventually urinated on by a card player, a demonstration of Godlessness that the Dogs couldn't let stand. Eventually, the unbelievers face was literaly rubbed in the piss-soaked book and they people were left in no doubt that Gods law was being brought to Broken Oak.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, two other characters visited the local steward, a former Dog and man of high regard. He warned them of the sin and degredation that they would find and the player roleplayed their characters brilliantly, laying down their mission and assuring the steward that all would be well. As their main mission at this time was to find somewhere to stay, the steward kindly offered them room in a bunkhouse, and they thanked him profusely for his kindness and charity. Then they left to round up the other Dogs and bring them the good news.<br/>
<br/>
A lone Dog had wandered off to scout around the town, just to check out the lie of the land. Behind a shabby house, he found a member of the faithful fornicating with a woman who was not his wife (a prostitute, in fact). Challenging him, the sinner fled but was easily chased down by the Dog and dragged, begging for forgiveness to the mian street, a sea of mud and lashing rain.<br/>
<br/>
The final Dog had taken it upon himself to rouse the faithful and attend up upon the Dogs to hear about their mission. The good people were duly alerted to the presence of Gods Watchdogs and were ready to bear witness to the acts which followed...<br/>
<br/>
The six Dogs, plus the now wailing sinner and distressed prostitute, had assembled in the main street, soaked to the skin and splattered with mud. What happened next was a conflict that I thought, at first, would be impossible to control, but worked out really well.<br/>
<br/>
A massive debate broke out amongst the Dogs as to how they should treat hte sinner. One wanted to hang him there and then as an example to all. The other were less inclined to mete out justice there and then and advised waiting until sunrise. Here the players were coming up with justifications from scripture as to why (or why this should not) be the case, they really got into the spirit of the thing. Numerous dice were stacked up round the table, raises and sees were flying, a couple of Dogs backed out of the conflict as it escalated all the way up. Until one Dog summarily shot the sinner in the head as an example of his faith in Gods justice.<br/>
<br/>
Then the Dogs turned on their errant Brother, who realised that his actions were not going to be popular. He fled, only to be gunned down by his brethren and, in the final conflict of the game, dispatched to wait upon Gods mercy.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusions<br/>
<br/>
The players all got to grips with the system, escalation and backing down extremely quickly. They learned how conflicts could spiral out of control end up far more serious than they could have at first imagined. The 6 person conflict actually proceeded quite smoothly, every taking their turn, pitching in with their own ideas and character decisions.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a vastly enjoyable gaming experience. For such a young group, unfamiliar with the more narrative style of play, they collectively put in a splendid performance.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

                            Pure Awesome - Did you talk to the players afterwards about the game?                        </div>

                            Fairly extensively, yes. The feedback was extremely positive. A couple gave the opinion that they were very wary of the system at first, but that they were amazed it handled such a huge conflict so well. They universally enjoyed the character creation system and were, overall, super keen to play again. They were regaling the other groups who were there (both playing D20 based games) with tales of Dogs, but not from a "Our game was better than yours" standpoint, but with enthusiasm and a desire to relate how the game went for them.<br/>
<br/>
An extremely positive experience.<br/>
<br/>

                            That's great!  <br/><br/>I would *love* to play Dogs with some folks who are the age that Dogs characters would actually be.  That sounds really fun.                        </div>
