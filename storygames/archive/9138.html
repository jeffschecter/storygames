What kinds of dwellings, religion, social customs, terminology, etc. might that produce? If I were running a leisurely game of Ganakagok, I'd want to spend a lot of time on that kind of stuff before the upheavals of play began changing everything.<br/><br/>So, Bill, I have two questions: (1), what's your take on this?, and (2) do you (or do you plan to) provide for those who share my tastes above by way of rules, instructions, options etc., or leave it up to the play group entirely?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201976/#Comment_201976" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T11:21:07+00:00" title="April 14, 2009 11:21AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2009 11:22AM by Bill_White.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave -- <br/><br/>I have a wishy-washy sort of answer.<br/><br/>If Ganakagok is any kind of sim, it's an impressionistic sort of sim, by which I mean it's designed to evoke the setting by implying it rather than spelling it out explicitly. The rules tell the GM to come up with a two-minute scene-setting opening pitch that's like (but not a verbatim repetition of) the preface to the game text in order to establish the context of the action. I say in the rules, "The point of this [pitch] is to give the in-game situation a sense of immediacy, to establish that it is what gets said at the table that is true, not what is written in the book. You don't have to worry about getting the details wrong." Additionally, the rules say that at the beginning of the game the GM may wish to "explicitly require or forbid particular motifs in the fiction"; for example, wooden ships from across the sea and so forth.<br/><br/>I hope that the effect of this to empower each GM with authority over the game-world. Are there other tribes? Do we have sled dogs? Is it a matriarchy? Well, you tell me. By the same token, there's nothing stopping a GM from taking the time to engage in preliminary anthropological discussions in order to establish some sort of cultural ground rules or base line before beginning play. <br/><br/>But the rules are intended to get pretty quickly to play. The rules as written call for the GM to lay out a two-minute, impressionistic vision of Ganakagok and then throw cards to read as the situation of the world and the situation of the people; soliciting player input into those readings is encouraged. After that, character generation begins and, as part of that process, players add characters or folkways to the relationship map of the village. What I'd recommend -- and this isn't part of the rules as written -- is extending that part of the process so that it produces a fuller vision of Nitu culture before actual play begins. So perhaps instead of adding either an NPC or a folkway, players are allowed to contribute one of each. Alternately, you can expand the GM's two-minute spiel to encompass the sort of brainstorming conversation you'd like to have.<br/><br/>My fear, though, is that sort of conversation locks things down that may be best if they emerge from play. The sorts of questions you're talking about do come up in play, and get answered in the moment that they need to be answered. Many questions come out of the players' interpretations of their cards, as they try to make sense of the motifs they've been given. <br/><br/>In short, I guess I'd say there's <i>room</i> for an extended preliminary anthropological discussion, if not a lot of <i>support</i> for it.<br/><br/>But maybe my fear is unfounded; I'm not sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201992/#Comment_201992" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T12:24:13+00:00" title="April 14, 2009 12:24PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>If the impressionist approach is part of your vision, cool.  It's only fair that I would have to find my own way to do something a little more explicit.  <br/><br/>As for what I'd do, I suspect that additional folkways during char-gen might do it.  Would you mind giving me a quick reminder of the process of adding a folkway?<br/><br/>As a GM, I think "take the game's basic premise and put your own 2-minute spin on it" sounds fine, but I might want some sort of orientation regarding which of my inventions might see play in what ways.  For example, if I say, "everyone lives underground", how will that influence play differently than if I say, "I want some death-rebirth cycle motifs in today's game"?  What are the ways in which I can tell the players, "here's what I want you to do, and here's how to do it", and they can tell me, "sure", "I'd rather not", or "back atcha!"?<br/><br/>Absent such expectations, I'd at least want to be told, "Hey, GM, play transforms and defines the setting and will take you new and unexpected places quickly.  Don't get too attached to anything you come up with pre-play -- it may not get much screen time."  In that case, I wouldn't spend much time prepping my 2-minute pitch; personally, I'd probably ad-lib it.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm focusing on the wrong particulars; I dunno.  But I do think it would be nice if groups knew how to establish whatever fictional traction they desired for their narrations.  If I want to contribute a bunch of sights/sounds/smells in my narration, do I have enough context to constrain and inspire me?  How about if I want to narrate an important social exchange with a lot of "this specific culture" flavor?  (Or would I essentially be "playing Ganakagok wrong" to focus too much on those sorts of gameworld details?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202048/#Comment_202048" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T18:43:28+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  6:43PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave --<br/><br/>You'll recall that, once everyone has a pretty good handle on who their characters are, we go around the table and let people add things to the setting. Everyone gets to add:<br/><br/>(1) One character or "folkway" (cultural truth) to the Nitu Map (the relationship map of characters in and around the village), and <br/>(2) One location or geographical fact to the Ganakagok Map (the physical map of the island of ice and surrounding waters).<br/><br/>So it would be easy enough to extend, augment, or amplify this part of the procedure to engage more deeply in cultural description before moving on to the next step.<br/><br/>As far as tweaking the plain-vanilla "you're like Eskimos, it's night, go!" setting goes, I'll point you to Don Corcoran's experience. He wanted to run a kind of wire-fu Ganakagok, sort of Crouching Polar Bear, Hidden Orca, and so he did. As I recall, there were some neat details from the two or three games he ran this way, like Nitu warriors leaping into the sky with their swords of ice and severing the wires that held enemy Stars in the heavens. But he told me that the game to a certain degree resisted this over-the-top interpretation, because the motifs and images on the Ganakagok deck were tied so firmly to a more prosaic setting. So I would say that you can probably expect to experience some mismatches of imagery to the extent that you depart from what the cards are able to depict.<br/><br/>Ad-libbing the two-minute spiel is exactly right: you want the starting place for the game to be what you are interested in having it be about in that moment; the players will have a chance to have their say as well.<br/><br/>I have to think about the rest; the short answer is that I think it works out in play. You are raising issues of what the Scandinavian larpers call "diegesis construction" (i.e., building a shared fiction); I'll have more to say about that when I come back from Knutepunkt!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
