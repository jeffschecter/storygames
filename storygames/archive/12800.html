Te next session would be about a new generation of heroes;<br/><br/>-Dirty Secrets, where you could technically tell new crime stories with a recurring investigator;<br/><br/>-Shock: Social Science-Fiction, where the grid has room for new Shocks, so you could keep exploring the game universe, with the same protagonists but a new Shock and new issues;<br/><br/>-A Thousand and One Night, in which courtiers who survived and didn't ained their freedoms can keep on telling each oter stories.<br/><br/>I'm curious to know if anyone here actually tried long-term play with any of these games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288152/#Comment_288152" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T13:08:58+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  1:08PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jumanji83</cite>-Dirty Secrets, where you could technically tell new crime stories with a recurring investigator;</blockquote>\nA Taste for Murder do this by default: the Investigator in the game is always "Investigator Chapel from Scotland Yard". But the role of the investigator is very different than in DS: in DS the investigart is the protagonist, and is "inside" the story. In ATfM is an outsider that it's "outside the story" and its only role is to force confessions from the protagonists...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288188/#Comment_288188" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T19:16:15+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  7:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello,<br/><br/>We ran a campaign of Dirty Secrets with a recurring investigator.  We ran a Novella, a Short Story and a Novel back to back.  We ended up also having a recurring "NPC" more or less by accident.  We liked the effect, a lot.<br/><br/>We pod casted about it here: <a href="http://apap.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apap.libsyn.com/</a> beginning at Episode 25.<br/><br/>I've also run a 9 Town run of Dogs in the Vineyard but I'm fond of saying that I should have stopped at Town 5.<br/><br/>Oh!  And from your list we also did three sessions of Shock in the same universe where the Shock was Robots.  The neat effect there was that one character who was an Antagonist in one session was used as Protagonist in another session.  Shock is great over multiple sessions.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288190/#Comment_288190" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T19:44:12+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  7:44PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IME, the opposite problem is games that *should* be played for multiple sessions that only get played as one-shots at cons.  3:16, Dogs, PTA...<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288218/#Comment_288218" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T02:30:25+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  2:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something that we've been turning our minds to recently over at the Collective Endeavour (<a href="http://collective-endeavour.com/forums/search.php?PostBackAction=Search&amp;Type=Topics&amp;Tag=campaigns" rel="nofollow">couple of threads here</a> - hopefully they will be of interest/use).
