The purpose of this rule was to limit the number of temptations in the game by making them of a heterosexual nature and also to direct the game in the intended direction, which was relationship semantics and infidelity. You can read the aforementioned thread if you want, but this thread is about fixing what's broken.  <br/><br/>I've just opened up the Doubt file again to clarify this and make the rule's formulation less offensive. Here is my first take. I've decided not to post the old formulations (look them up if you need them). I want these judged on their own, and not in relation to the old stuff. <br/><br/><br/>\xa72\u2003Temptations are of heterosexual nature (*)<br/><br/>This is to lower the number of possible relations to a manageable number and to make sure the same person plays all temptations for Tom or Julia. Doubt was not intended as a a game about coming out or fighting hetero-normativity but the semantics of relationships.<br/><br/><br/>The (*) is clarified later on the page in smaller print thus:<br/><br/><br/>(*) Naturally, what Doubt is about is up to you. Feel free to remove this rule, make all temptations of a homosexual nature, or whatever you feel is right for you. In the end, playing close to home means playing with what you can relate to and the nature of the temptations should reflect that. <br/><br/><br/>So, please fire away. Constructive criticism please.

If it were my game, I might have put in something like this:<br/><br/>\xa72\u2003Temptations are limited in scope.<br/>There should be a manageable number of relations. Not everyone should be a potential partner for everyone else - it makes things too complicated, and changes the focus of the game. To keep things from getting too chaotic, we usually play with the limitation that all temptations are of a heterosexual nature. However, your group may have a different preference. Discuss it with the group and choose one of the following:<br/>- All temptations are of a heterosexual nature.<br/>- All temptations are of a homosexual nature.<br/>- Some other limitation that's easy to remember and relate to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mikael" title="Mikael"><img alt="Mikael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mikael">Mikael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194054/#Comment_194054" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T01:40:35+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  1:40AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Matthijs said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194661/#Comment_194661" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T16:18:50+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  4:18PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 4:40PM by chearns.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tobias Wrigstad</cite>Constructive criticism please.</blockquote>\nTobias, when the thread popped up the first time, I was ready to hate this game. Because of the no Homosexual temptations thing. Not because I was against it, I can see why it is there, but because it, like most of culture, denies the reality of bisexual existence. It seemed to be taking a very binary view of sexuality which is one of my annoyances.<br/><br/>However, that being said, Doubt provides a cast of characters. Once I understood that I realized that only allowing Heterosexual couplings made sense. I mean, yes I guess you could put in extra work to come up with two more sets of characters for Homosexual couples, or some kind of logic on how to approach bisexual characters, but, seriously, as a bisexual, once I understood the nature of how the game worked, I wasn't all that bothered. If I were to put any kind of foot note, it would probably just be to explain that it's heterosexual only because of the premade cast of characters and because of the logistics involved with bi characters.<br/><br/>If you want the foot note to look like it currently does, I think it's pretty good. The last line is what makes it work for me. That being said, if I want Bi characters I end up wondering if the rules will hold up (I haven't given that question any thought, I have only briefly scanned the rules and the extras).<br/><br/>EDIT: I should also add that if I was bothered by the heteronormativeness of it, I would not play it. I would not do the necessary work to create a new cast of characters or come up with a logic to allow for bi characters. So whether or not you are interested in reaching the queer players (so that they too can play the game close to home) shouldn't really be about footnotes, but rather about providing the same framework that you provide to straight players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194671/#Comment_194671" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T16:52:52+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  4:52PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>EDIT: I should also add that if I was bothered by the heteronormativeness of it, I would not play it.

So, what I should really do \u2013 I now realise \u2013 is remove this rule, talk about playing close to home, how to agree on something for all players in a group, and then just say "distribute the temptation characters among the temptation players as you see fit". <br/><br/>I think I was stuck in one way of thinking about this. This feels like a better way to do it altogether.
