Last Night (1998) is a low budget affair featuring a really strange acting style.  Except for a handful of images and a few really terrific lines, I didn't love it.  But the concept is awesome.  Everyone in the world knows the world is going to end at midnight, six hours from now.  Something to do with the sun.  <br/><br/>I want to game this concept.  Having every PC know that they and everyone else in the world has six hours to live has the potential to create some really great scenes and character pieces.  All the characters would be perfectly ordinary people.  No ninjas or sorcerers.<br/><br/>I thought a lot about this movie afterwards in the frame of Story Now and the one-shot convention culture.  Like how, for me, even a setup like this (six hours until the end of the world) is not really suitable for a one-shot.  I think I would want two or three sessions to do it right.  Lots of flashbacks with careful and deliberate dialogue.  Really working to give the characters some depth before the inevitable end.<br/><br/>I don't own Death's Door.  I know at least a couple people in Portland do and I want to play it some time but I don't know if it would do this concept.  Does Death's Door assume that you're leaving people behind?  Ribbon Drive or PTA were also games that occurred to me.  Any other thoughts?  Has anyone gamed a scenario like this?  Countdown to an apocalypse where there's not going to be a post-apocaylpse?<br/><br/>This quote from Roger Ebert's review of the film amused me:<br/><br/><i>On a talk show in Toronto, I was asked to define the difference between American and Canadian films, and said I could not. Another guest was Wayne Clarkson, the former director of the Toronto Film Festival. He said he could, and cited this film.  Sandra Oh goes into a grocery story to find a bottle of wine for dinner," he said.<br/> <br/>"The store has been looted, but she finds two bottles still on the shelf. She takes them down, evaluates them, chooses one, and puts the other one politely back on the shelf. That's how you know it's a Canadian film." </i><br/><br/>I want a game session with scenes like that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292816/#Comment_292816" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T09:34:48+00:00" title="September 10, 2010  9:34AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a neat twist would be that the planet is going to explode and only a select few have tickets to fly off-world before hand.  The world is going to end in 24 hours and you've got a ticket to ride in 12.  What do you do during earth's last day knowing everyone else is going to die.  The characters all play people that, for one reason or other, have tickets.  Imagine the disconnect between the craziness of the end of the world for everyone else and what for you could be as casual as a layover before a flight - or is this painful for you?  Do you give your ticket away?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292818/#Comment_292818" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T09:39:38+00:00" title="September 10, 2010  9:39AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fascinating (and I see that Last Night is on Netflx, so thanks...I'll have to check it out).<br/><br/>Not sure why this wouldn't work as a one-shot. It seems to me that the attenuated time-frame of a one-shot would punctuate the shortened time-frame until the apocalypse arrives. Unless one session was spent setting up 'normalcy' and then a subsequent session (or sessions) rapidly brings that to a halt and ushers everyone to their doom. Not having seen the film I may be reading this wrong...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292822/#Comment_292822" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T09:59:01+00:00" title="September 10, 2010  9:59AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depending on your take on the last night theme, PTA or Fiasco would work.

But this community plays lots of games about extreme circumstances and difficult choices.<br/><br/>The specific frame here is there are seemingly no more choices because there will soon be no more repercussions.  There is basically only what you say to the people you care about, your attitude towards the life you've led, towards the inevitable end, and what that says about your character.  In the movie, one of the characters can't get home to her husband and spends her last hours with a stranger who has intimacy issues because he lost someone.<br/><br/>Tangentially, I'm reminded I should probably pick up A Flower For Mara.<br/><br/>Alex: It probably would work as a one-shot for some people.  For me it made me reflect on the techniques people use to short-hand characterization when role-playing in abbreviated forms.  That's what was keeping me up.  For me, a lot of these techniques bypass the possibility of characters that have much depth to them.  We use symbols and archetypes and then that's all the character is.  It's "that guy/gal."  It serves but it's not ideal.<br/><br/>It's just my flow.  I have trouble deciding quickly who a character is and then "playing them" in the context of a one-shot.  I say things and then that's who the character is.  And then I improv more things and then that's *also* who my character is.  And then by the end of a three hour session I start to learn who they are and start to care about them.  Same with how I approach the other players' characters.  <br/><br/>Jason: Yeah, I'm leaning towards PTA.  In my concept the characters definitely have Issues to try to resolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292827/#Comment_292827" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T10:16:01+00:00" title="September 10, 2010 10:16AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2010 10:59AM by mease19.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Depending on your take on the last night theme, PTA or Fiasco would work.

Each time you do a regular draw, you add an additional vertical block to the second stack.  Because this is an inherently less stable stack, you should expect it to fall every 4-8 draws.  You could then use it as a game clock to count down to events.  For a game like this, an hour could pass every time the second stack fell.<br/><br/>[edit] I was writing this at the same time as your last post so it is a little off from what I now see that you were thinking.  Regardless, you could still use this prop-clock mechanism to add a sense of tension to the hours passing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
