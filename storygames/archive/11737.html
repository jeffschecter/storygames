Laura, Jesse, Patrick, and Will got together and played a game of Montsegur 1244. We talk about playing within the constraints of real historical events, playing with a set cast of characters and their built in relationships and situation, finally we cover our standard topic for GMless games; who does the game fill the GM's role systematically.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinks:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://spookyouthouse.com/" rel="nofollow">Spooky Outhouse Productions</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://spookyouthouse.com/forum/index.php?board=81.0" rel="nofollow">Actual People, Actual Play forum</a> at Spooky Outhouse Productions<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail the show at actualpeopleactualplay@gmail.com<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow us on Twitter <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://twitter.com/LauraBishop" rel="nofollow">Laura</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://twitter.com/jburneko" rel="nofollow">Jesse</a>, and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://twitter.com/Will_H_" rel="nofollow">Will</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/index.html" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a> from Thoughtful Games<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9725" rel="nofollow">AP thread</a> on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">Story Games</a>, I give a more thorough breakdown of the different games that emerge during play.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the pictures of the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://s2.hubimg.com/u/434325_f520.jpg" rel="nofollow">ruins</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://iberaldea.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/montsegur.jpg" rel="nofollow">surrounding area</a> I printed out to show the group.

I wouldn't have jumped to the conclusion of "witchcraft = actual magic" so much as "the perception of witchcraft based on traditional beliefs or folk wisdom".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262368/#Comment_262368" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T17:17:08+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  5:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey,<br><br>In the discussion I may have over emphasized the potential for fantasy with the Witchcraft card.  Obviously the degree to which the group wants the elements to be fantastical in nature is customizable.<br><br>My MAIN point was that however you interpret the card, things like the Witchcraft card and the Holy Grail are tone changers.  Even if you go with the totally mundane it's all just superstition and fear interpretation as soon as someone starts muttering about Witchcraft, cows start dying of plague, etc the game is going to go in TOTALLY different direction from that point forward.  Those things draw attention and can not be easily ignored and are laced with all kinds of emotional content.  Holding a card like and the choice whether to play it or not and when is a BIG DEAL.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262471/#Comment_262471" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T08:53:10+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  8:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, sure, that sounds absolutely true: they are bangs waiting to happen, and they will change the game for sure.

The descriptions I'd read of M1244 elsewhere didn't really grab me, but listening to the way it actually played out made me very keen. I suspect I'll pick it up once my self-imposed ban on buying new RPGs is over. I've long been enamoured of the idea of pregen characters who have their conflicts ready-to-boil, and I also like games in which characters can't die in play, forcing the conflict in other directions.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm getting at is that I like the way your podcast "reviews without reviewing", in that you just discuss the game, and the way its bits interact, without just setting out to say "good/bad".<br/><br/>Keep it up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
