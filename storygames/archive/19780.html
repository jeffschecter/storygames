I've toyed with the idea of quickly building a simple game for my needs, but I've figured I'd see if there's anything already out there that'd do the trick with a lot less hassle on my end.<br/><br/>So, Story Games Community, any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438828/#Comment_438828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T18:57:26+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  6:57PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/avatar-world-version-v1-5-released-828#Item_146" rel="nofollow">Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand presto!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad" title="Wes_the_mad"><img alt="Wes_the_mad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nNGKML0VGFY5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad">Wes_the_mad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438832/#Comment_438832" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T19:42:43+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  7:42PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/avatar-world-version-v1-5-released-828#Item_146" rel="nofollow">Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand presto!</a></blockquote>\nI remember lurking in that thread when it was in a previous version. I'll have to take a look at what's been updated. <br/>The only potential qualm I can see is that Tags are so similar to FATE's Aspects, the part of FATE's mechanics my players didn't seem to really "get" all that well in prior attempts. Maybe this'll be the gateway that makes FATE's Aspects click more with them, we'll see.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438833/#Comment_438833" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T21:08:32+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  9:08PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If by any chance that doesn't work and your players start craving for more precise/complex rules, give Mutants &amp; Masterminds a try.

I'm thinking of giving it a try. Upon further reading it seems your Tags invoke the Consequence portion of FATE Core where "damage" is modeled with phrases rather than a numerical value. Am I interpreting that right?<br/><br/>Unfortunately my players find that sort of thing hardest to gronk it seems. They're all so used to numerical damage or ticking off boxes in a stress track. I've tried to break them into other ways of showing damage taken, but they've so far been resistant.<br/><br/>I'll take a look at Anima Prime, though.

Anima Prime is a good pick as well. Wounds are also really easy to track: you have three wound boxes, and if you can't defend against an attack, mark one off! Otherwise, it's got this neat dynamic of building up dice pools throughout the combat to unleash them in a strike.<br/><br/>There's also some neat optimization tricks that go on in the game, such as stacking conditions on an enemy (Conditions are laid out in the rulebook as things that have different mechanical effects; it's pretty neat).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438851/#Comment_438851" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-30T10:12:17+00:00" title="September 30, 2014 10:12AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For sure, I just wanted to explain the distinction I draw between Tags/Aspects in case you do play it because it's something I've heard several times and want to explore how they're actually linked.<br/>You're correct about damage being modeled in phrases that more accurately reflect the new situation post-move. It makes changes to characters' situations more significant because it both allows them to define how they affect their foes and it allows me as MC to restrict what they're allowed to do narratively (making their struggles actually affect the sitch, rather than just being a numerical state).<br/>I totally understand the difficulty of breaking away from a stress-track. Pick a game that your players will understand enough to enjoy, that's what's improtant.<br/><br/>(and thank you for paying attention to my game!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438857/#Comment_438857" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-30T14:05:08+00:00" title="September 30, 2014  2:05PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Anima Prime. \u2665 For a more minimalist approach, though, I suggest you also have a look at Archipelago (currently Archipelago III, I think): that you're able to play from an existing fictional setting (rather than make it up as you go) is a core design feature of that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438915/#Comment_438915" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-02T14:17:27+00:00" title="October  2, 2014  2:17PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/130108/SUPERS-Revised-Edition" rel="nofollow">Supers!</a> would be a good system to use. <br/><br/>If you want more work to do, hacking <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a> could also be worthwhile.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
