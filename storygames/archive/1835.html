                    Jason said something last week that has been bothering me
<blockquote>Anecdotally,<i>I'm Gonna Make You Awesome</i>is easier in theory than in practice, but it is really nice when it works. Of course you can and should internalize it and just do it, which is what improvisers do. It's unspoken, you just make your partners rock out on stage whenever you can.</blockquote>
I have been thinking of little else since he first brought up the concept last summer. I want to make a game that instills the idea I'm-gonna-make-you-awsome-ness in everyone who reads it. and now he thinks it's too hard. What are the measures you have taken to make other characters more awsome and how can we make it easier for others to do the same?                </div>

                            I find environment, tone and color useful as well.<br/>
<br/>
How affective would octaNe be if the cover wasn't a psychotronic action scene and the tone of the book wasn't laid back "let's rock!" fun?<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, would Vampire have it's cool impact if it didn't have pale, austere chicks in tight leather with katanas and mobiles wearing sunglasses?<br/>
<br/>
These things say to the reader/player "don't you want to be this cool? Play this game and you can."<br/>
<br/>
I miss GM screens for this. The illustrations of powerful game happenings in front of everyone all game.                        </div>

                            It's not "too hard", it's just proven awkward for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>1.  Sometimes there's just social contract stuff in the way.  Sometimes it feels weird to articulate your intentions toward another person in advance.  Some people may not like it, actually.  <br/><br/>2.  Sometimes you can't, or really shouldn't, because you don't quite know where things are going in-game.  Then IGMYA becomes vague, or weak.  "I'm gonna make you awesome by ... supporting whatever it is you do!"<br/><br/>3.  Sometimes ... well,  I also had a distressing moment when I suggested my players go through the exercise, which they enthusiastically did ... leaving me, the GM, entirely out.  WTF, guys?<br/><br/>That's been my experience.  I think it works better when internalized, when your desire to make other players look fantastic is like a ravenous tiger of goodwill chained to your magnanimous heart.<br/><br/>EDIT:  No idea why this is coming out as a quote.                        </div>

I'm Gonna Make You Awesome should be the rule of the role-playing land, as far as I'm concerned. I guess I think of it as an attitude you should bring to the social contract, as a conscious antidote to nitpicking and rules-lawyering and petty egotism. If someone can build it into the reward system, dat's coo' too.                        </div>

                            What Larry said. IGMYA is almost more of an <i>ethic</i> than a technique. It's a way of approaching collaboration that's positive and synergetic rather than subtractive and critical.                        </div>

                            Hang on, hang on.<br/><br/><i>I'm Gonna Make You Awesome</i> is a very specific exercise, designed to get players to focus on what they can do to support other players. It does two things: it gets players into the mindset of supporting each other; and it opens up a discussion of what players want from each other.<br/><br/>Now, sure, you can use the mechanics to let players reward each other. But that's a rather different thing from the original exercise. I'm Gonna Make You Awesome isn't about designing games: it's much more of a social contract thing.<br/><br/>We're in danger of widening this discussion to <i>anything</i> that can be done to "Make players awesome", whatever that means. That's, surely, an impossibly broad discussion. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Sorry Grahm - That is what I meant. I want to develop systems to make IGMYA a part of play. If we fix the exercise that's cool too, but I want to bring it to a base of play and if it doesn't work as an exercise that aint gonna happen. I was looking for ways people have used rewards and explanations to encourage this kind of thinking. Sorry if I was unclear that's part of my problem.                        </div>

                            If I can go by negative example, I think the bad gamer habit that IGMYA specifically works to kill off is fomented by a particularly nasty strain of "My Guy"-ism. You have a certain school of game texts, GURPS 3e for example, which specifically encourages players not to communicate with or make helpful suggestions to one another unless they could realistically do it "in character." The logical extension of this behavior is the sort of turtling up where the only encouraged attempts at contributing to the SIS are through the lens of what "my guy" can realistically do. Cue player apathy.<br/>
<br/>
So I suppose IGMYA as applied in game texts involves explicitly soliciting players to throw out positive suggestions and feedback to one another, kibbitz about what's the coolest action to take before it actually hits the SIS, to build off of contributions instead of blocking, and generally practice basic, healthy social communication. I see most Forge-spawned indie titles explicitly or implicitly endorsing these things, at least not actively working against IGMYA.<br/>
<br/>
But I think IGMYA goes beyond those things too. The actual stating that maximum exaltation of the creative esteem of others is the agreed-upon social goal seems pretty key.                        </div>

                            Half-baked ideas:<br><br>* Reverse fanmail. To mechanically reward cool suggestions, what if players could (or had to) buy other players' suggestions using points <i>before</i> initiating an action?

                            Can you guys describe this exercise? I have a general sense of what "making a person awesome" means, but maybe that's off of the exercise.<br/>_______________<br/><br/>That said, following my understanding of the topic, I am extremely leery that a mechanical solution will ever "fix" this. There's certain aspects of play which are simply narrative. You can build mechanics that play off of these narraives aspects, but the mechanics can never, by themselves, encourage this type of thing.<br/><br/>Here's your real life example: The Mountain Witch. Do you think the Trust mechanics encourages players to mistrust one another? Nope. Or do the Fate mechanics encourage players to create morally ambuiguous characters and set up situations to "hang themselves" like Tony mentions in his other thread? Nope.<br/><br/>If a player in tMW wants to be trusting and non-suspicians and "upright", there's nothing the rules can do stop that. All the stuff I mention in the book to encourage this type of behavior is soft-selling, social- and narrative-level stuff.<br/><br/>Maybe here's another way to say this: You can create mechanics that reward this type of behavior, but if I don't know HOW to do this in the first place, how are the mechanics going to help?<br/><br/>One of issues here is that this stuff is largely about finding stuff that the player is interested in. (Alot of RPG play is about finding out what interests the other player.) Because of that, you have to modify what you do for each player. And because of that, you can't really quantify it into hard mechanics. Instead, you need soft advice that relies on social and actual play context.<br/>________________<br/><br/>OK, so what I <i>think</i> we're talking about here is really protagonization. An protagonization requires two things, I think. First is antagony. The other is, err, support. Non-obstacle opportunities for protagonization.<br/><br/>Example: Your a good for nothing street thug. Antagony---a cop that has a hard-on for proving you guilty. Support---a woman that loves you.<br/>_________________<br/><br/>Am I still on the same page as everyone?                        </div>

                            The things I'm espacialy looking for are the sort of things you would do to help Tony "hang his character" if you know that will make Tony's play better. How can we support other players well and specificly play that is different from yours in style. How can we explaine and encourage support of others in play without completely giving up your character?<br/><br/>I think that Gift Dice and Fan-mail are really cool mechanical  ways to help this. I think that the section on screen presence in PTA talks about this well. I was looking for other mechanics, explanations and tricks that would improve upon this sort of thing. <br/><br/>I also think that group charactger creation itself is one of the starts to making your character awsome. The more I know up front about what you want your character to be the better I can make my character fit into that story and vise versa. <br/><br/>Tim - I think that you are right about the needs for connectedness antags and support and the more they have in common throughout the group the cooler that can be. Someone was describing a chart in Tenra Bansho that determines how an NPC is related to a character; it might be a cool feature for everyone to develope an antag and then all the other players describe how they are also connected to the antag. That might help the players to drive other characters toward the conflicts they enjoy.                        </div>

                            I think your protest, Tim, is ironic. You say, "It can't be done mechanically - see here in TMW how I did it mechanically?"<br/>
<br/>
Yes it's an ethic, and one that you can instil through exercises. But the question at the beginning of the thread included "ways to make this easier?" I think that mechanics can be put in place that facilitate this.<br/>
<br/>
And, actually, I think that the ones cited are the most rudimentary ones. Fan Mail is dead simple (and that has it's own advantages), it gives you a currency that moves the game with which to reward folks. And even this little thing does help from what I've seen in play. Especially with players who may not know the ethic. That is, you can get the sort of play you're looking for, perhaps without the exercise.<br/>
<br/>
But Fan Mail and such, again, are rudimentary. As very simple ideas, they don't go very deeep into promoting this sort of thing, IMO. Chris, above, is starting to delve into something deeper. But I have an example from an actual game that works pretty well. From the game Unsung, Kirt Dankmeyer has "Gifts." Basically this mechanic allows other players to create adversity for other player characters, and get direct awards for it, if the player for whom the adversity is created accepts the suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
"Gift! Your character finds out that the villain is his father!"<br/>
"Uh, wow. Didn't see that coming. Cool, I accept, here's your point."<br/>
<br/>
And I think that even that is only sorta rudimentary, too. That is, these mechanics all go straight for the clitoris. "Do good, get points." I think that they could be incorporated more intrinsically with other parts of the game in more complex ways that could serve to really propel players to constantly be "awesomeizing" just by playing the rest of the game. That is, not some mechanic tacked on, but something more integral to the game.<br/>
<br/>
Actually Trust mechanics are pretty close already, too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Mike<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Oh, BTW, I don't like the exercise as presented, because it smacks to me of "playing before you play." That is, if you say, "I'm going to make your character awesome by having the villain be his father" that really saps the drama out of the presentation. It should happen in play, and spontaneously. Mechanics can facilitate and incentivize.                        </div>

                            Joshua BishopRoby has a good mechanic in Full Light, Full Steam: the "scrip". Characters in FLFS each have "thematic batteries" (= flags), and if you reference another player's character's thematic battery in your narration you pass the other player a scrip (a piece of paper) and they sign it. You get "spoils" (= XP) for this - <i>and in no other way</i>. You cannot advance your character without hitting other people's flags.                        </div>

                            Big thanks to Thor for having started this thread  and getting me thinking about awesome.<br>
I'll have a new thread later on with a more in depth thing like this for my own game.<br>
<br>
This idea is mostly a Burning Empires/Wheel hack. It seems that it needs a few thing to really make it go but its not a bad start I think.<br>
Each character/player has Beliefs/Flags. Beliefs tell everyone about the characters. Flags tell everyone what the player wants. (1)<br>
Artha can be spent to give you a die bonuses (More dice, easier/better successes.).<br>
Artha is awarded (By the GM) for hitting on your beliefs or on another player's flags/beliefs. Everyone nominates and votes on artha handouts at the end of the session. (2)<br>
Artha can be donated no strings attached or for a specific action. (3)<br>
When artha is spent on another player for a specific skill roll you test for advancement as well. (4)<br>
<br>
Now this is how I see these making things more awesome.<br>
(1) Gets what people think is awesome out in the open.<br/>
(2) The GM gives rewards as for things as things happen to put more currency into the system and encourage players to do interesting things. The players voting on artha handouts at the end get people to talk about and highlight what they liked.<br/>
(3) The players can give rewards to the other players to encourage each other.<br/>
(4) Encourages the use of Artha on the other guy..<br/>
<br/>
Since Artha is in limited quantities and different types not everyone can make you awesome at once or all the time.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
