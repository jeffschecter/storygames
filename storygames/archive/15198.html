Any thoughts about what's the most compelling among these or other recent games that use playing cards?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345490/#Comment_345490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T18:40:05+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  6:40PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>You might find Jonathan Benn's new game, <a href="http://www.benn.ca/muse/" rel="nofollow">Muse</a>, quite interesting.<br/><br/>No other thoughts for now!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345495/#Comment_345495" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T19:00:09+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  7:00PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2011 7:05PM by Peter_Aronson.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Newt Newport's <a href="http://d101games.co.uk/books/monkey" rel="nofollow">Monkey: The Storytelling Game of the Journey to the West</a> uses standard playing card-based conflict resolution.<br/><br/>There also seems to be a recent spate of games that use Tarot Cards -- Fortune's Fool, Archetype, House of Cards.<br/><br/>And just to be confusing, Eric Boyd is working on (and has been working on for quite some time) a heist caper game also called House of Cards that also uses standard playing cards for conflict resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345500/#Comment_345500" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T19:28:47+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  7:28PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel Schmiedekamp's "Escape From Prince Charming", an entrant in Iron Game Chef 2006: "A session of Escape from Prince Charming on its face seems more like a card game than a RPG.

I hadn't heard anything since the ashcan a couple Gen Cons ago.<br/><br/>The Cel*Style crew is doing a lot with playing cards lately; GxB (and its upcoming hack BxB), The Tulip Academy's Society for Dangerous Gentlemen, and Hot Guys Making Out all use a standard deck.  I've played all three; they're all pretty short, very narration-heavy games that last an hour or two.  Of the three, Tulip Academy most easily lends itself to ongoing play (the other two seem really one-shotty, since they have predetermined characters and situation), but there's not a lot of character advancement.<br/><br/>GxB's card use is almost vestigial, but then it's a very very simple game; basically, Momoko's player gives her suitors' players a face-down card every time they charm her on their dates, and at game's end she falls for the suitor who drew the most Hearts.<br/><br/>Tulip Academy has more of a "game" element; a Dangerous Gentleman solves problems by his skill at Art, Science, or Fencing, and each has their own competitive minigame based on an existing card game (conflicts of Science are similar to blackjack, for instance).  The deck is also used as an oracle to frame scenes and pick the general theme of the adventure.<br/><br/>Hot Guys Making Out falls between the two; there's no competitive element per se, but the actions your character can take are dependent on exactly what card you played this turn (the characters have a usual range of behavior, but playing a heart or the court card each corresponds to allows them to dramatically break character).  The rhythm this enforces is surprisingly evocative of the languidly-paced romance manga it emulates, but I'll post a bit more about that in the Bite-Sized AP thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345519/#Comment_345519" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T00:24:24+00:00" title="October 11, 2011 12:24AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone is sure to talk about it soon.
