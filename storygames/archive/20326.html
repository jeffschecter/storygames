I keep wanting to shake people, from every range of opinions actually, and tell them this: "Go play 5 sessions each of Lady Blackbird and PrimeTime Adventures, 10 of Dogs in the Vineyard, 1 of Fiasco, 3 each of Polaris and Grey Ranks, and 50 of Burning Wheel. Oh, also go write and run a 10 person LARP and a 30 person one. Then you will *begin* to be qualified to have this conversation with me."<br/><br/>You (generic you, not you specifically, Sandra) need to see the range of affordances out there in terms of, specifically, improvisation vs. pre-prepared content, to really understand that debate. In particular, I think it helps to have played some games where there is prepped content, but it's not situated in the same way as it is in D&amp;D or an OSR game (I'm thinking here specifically of Dogs, where it would be "cheating" to change the relationship network you set up in prep, but things aren't nearly as closely tied to specific locales as in a dungeon.)<br/><br/>Of course, we also got to experience that most intense of Internet joys: the deliberately derailing edge case! Like, yes, some modules *are* so badly-designed that they are basically unrunnable as written. But that's kind of besides the point, you know?<br/><br/>Good news, though, in terms of burnout, I've just designed a new campaign framework which I'm really excited to try out, that might interest you, and I'm going to make a new thread about shortly.<br/><br/>Some day I will come to where you are and we will hang out and game in person and it will be awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448105/#Comment_448105" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T06:08:05+00:00" title="August 21, 2015  6:08AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ironically enough it wasn't even in that thread,  it was in some other completely unexpected thread.<br/>I was trying to talk about the differences between the 4e fighter and the 5e fighter.<br/>I mean, to me 4e's fighter is so deep into \u201ddice\u201d land with its large number of mechanical procedures so there's a big difference there, but in \u201dcloud\u201d land they're not so different. <strong>Maybe I'm wrong about that</strong>, I don't know everything, but I don't mind being wrong as long as I'm not mean <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448106/#Comment_448106" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T06:09:23+00:00" title="August 21, 2015  6:09AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Matt, that is indeed good news.

If they want to micromanage things to that extent, and their players enjoy it, that's on them. I think they play a fundamentally different role, have different responsibilities than a "referee\u201d DM. Which, y'know, is cool too. I guess their way has worked for them for a long time.<br/><br/>It's just\u2026 I can imagine that their players would be: "Oh why did you kill us! Why was that fight so easy! Why was that fight so hard! Why was that fight so long! Why was that fight so short! Why did you not give us a chance!\u201d and they're running around with a net trying to second guess the system, override the system, smooth things over\u2026 and I do not doubt it works very well. Those problems don't happen as often for them, because they get pretty good at it. It also has potential to become a spiral. Having to smooth over more and more, because "scene manager\u201d becomes more and more their job.<br/><br/>But for me when those things happen (and they do a lot), it's the game's fault. The game becomes this magic 8-ball that me and the players both trust in and can complain about and appreciate. It becomes an external system with which to engage. I don't have to both be the engine and drive the car at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448108/#Comment_448108" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T06:40:55+00:00" title="August 21, 2015  6:40AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This started with Everway.

Which wouldn't be half bad if those people at least knew how to be a good audience, but oftentimes they don't\u2026 People are not generally trained or socialized to be a respectful, grateful audience to their entertainers: instead, they generally act needy and entitled. Mostly, those who overcome this are only those who learn to master the specific art at hand and become entertainers themselves.<br/><br/>Damn if I don't get this feeling all the time when I invite people over for actual <i>dinner</i>, not RPGs! The best dining guests are those who can cook themselves: you can see they understand, they appreciate your work and enjoy the meal - or, if they don't like it, at least they're willing to either give genuinely helpful advice or shut the fuck up/make small talk about something else entirely, right?<br/>Whereas, the irritating kind of guest (always somebody who can't cook) doesn't even bother to ask what you made for them: they make requests. There's the people who eat like three things in the world, full stop, and they fully expect you to make two of those three dishes for them: they won't try anything else. There's the people who always add salt or other condiments <i>before tasting</i>. And then there's the people who liked what you cooked them when they first visited and expect you to make the same exact thing again, and again \u2014 which might be sort-of flattering once, but it gets old fast. Mostly, these people don't even realize they're being annoying, and the crazy thing is - according to contemporary etiquette - <i>I can't tell them</i>. Telling them equals being all snooty and snobbish about food (huge taboo! who would ever want to sound like a hipster?), impolite to my very own guests\u2026 'Cause it's all just a matter of tastes, right? And all tastes are equal, or something.<br/><br/>All of the above: not a metaphor for something else. Which I guess can be enlightening, in a way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448113/#Comment_448113" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T11:22:57+00:00" title="August 21, 2015 11:22AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2015 11:23AM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It started with us going out to eat most times we played. But I couldn't afford it after a while. The other players had much more money than me. So I started eating something before they arrived and they ate out together.<br/><br/>But the new player we have is in a similar economic situation to mine. So he suggested that we as a group cook together. But every time "we've" (I've) done that, he's been late and just been eating. When "we" (I) don't cook he's early and arrives while I'm doing the last minute cleaning.<br/><br/>And he's always the one pushing for that solution, which... is understandable. I don't know him nearly as well as the others (we kinda picked him up at a con this spring) and I don't know where he lives or if he has travel long. But it's also frustrating.<br/><br/>I also feel bad to think about this issue because when I hang out with my non-gamer friends, we typically cook or eat together, or, worse (for my conscience's sake) they cook.<br/><br/>Before this situation the bulk of the prep before every session was cleaning my apartment. Doing the actual game prep was also a bit of work; creatively, it's fun, but I also have to print out some tables, do the faction turn, roll up treasures etc. I've delegated some of this but not all.<br/><br/>I'd say it was 60% cleaning, 40% game prep. But on "cooking" days, that takes as much energy as the other two chores put together. (So, normalized, 30% cleaning, 20% game prep, 50% food prep -- but altogether 200%.)<br/><br/>I am so incredibly picky about food so it's hard for me to accept help (kinda goes the same for game prep). They will put things into the food that I can't eat.<br/><br/>I have social issues and I have trouble with executive function. And that goes for a couple of the other players in the group too, including this "Let's cook together! Oh btw I'm an hour late" guy.<br/><br/>The one thing I have the most trouble with in the whole world, or maybe second to touching things that have been inside other people (like used chewing gum), is responsibility. Being responsible for myself eating well is very difficult. Doing that for a whole group makes it a lot harder.<br/><br/>I think this is why my D&amp;D group has been so much more sustained than any other RPG attempt. Because the oracular nature of the game takes on a lot of the responsibility. We just have to show up with our ingredients (maps, characters) and let the system do its job.<br/><br/>But it's not so easy when it comes to other things. All the routines and "systems" I rely upon (I do cook a lot) are based on amounts, cooking times etc for one person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448114/#Comment_448114" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T12:47:53+00:00" title="August 21, 2015 12:47PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leave this group, now. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448115/#Comment_448115" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T12:57:18+00:00" title="August 21, 2015 12:57PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ??????<br/>I built this group                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448116/#Comment_448116" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T16:31:49+00:00" title="August 21, 2015  4:31PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This will sound silly but... make a list of food you can buy (snacks, and take-away food) and that you all can eat.

(In the same way you're doing it in-game: "Hey, here's how it works. If you show up late and don't help cook, you're on your own next time. Cool?" Now the decision is no longer on your head, you've all agreed to the consequences. And everyone will respect and like you for that. People, in general, like dealing with people who are assertive and stand up for themselves - it's easier! And yet for some reason we often fear to do that. I don't know if that's your case, but I thought I'd mention it.)<br/><br/>However: <br/><br/>The general frustration you're describing, and particularly the feeling you're talking about with playing Everway, is a very, very familiar one.<br/><br/>I'm fairly sure that this feeling was probably the primary impetus behind the Forge and the Forge designers' attempts at redefining gaming. "Let's create systems which apportion social pressure better, so we can all have fun without playing these weird social struggle games!"<br/><br/>And if I'm wrong about that... well, it was still one of the MAJOR driving forces behind the whole movement.<br/><br/>I remember those discussions where Ron laid out the responsibilities of the GM, and pointed out how often things like "organizing the session", "inviting the players", "cleaning the space", "prepping for the game", "providing snacks", and so forth appeared to just be assumed to come with "tell the story", "make all the important calls in-game", "know the rules inside-and-out", and, essentially, "be responsible for the group having fun" (as you point out in your Everway experiences). That's a heavy burden (even just one of those would be), and no wonder "GM burnout" was a very common topic.<br/><br/>I think the whole OSR approach (sandbox, let the dice fall where they may, principled GMing, etc) which you seem to be gravitating towards is one pretty good solution to the problem of "being responsible for the fun", and shifting that to the group itself.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to do that with the social aspects, too. Maybe someone else can host the game, for instance? I'd even imagine that if your friends are wealthy enough to go out for dinner each time you play, they wouldn't mind all chipping in a few dollars to buy you dinner in exchange for all the work you do GMing the game.

When our <i>GM kept falling asleep</i>, for example, we shifted to playing more board games.<br/>Sometimes it works, though. When going out to eat was expensive and cut into our gaming time, we just told everyone to arrive fed. The only reason we had developed the habit of going out to eat together was that it had become a sort of "intrigue time" that was an extension of a particular campaign with a lot of scheming. But those discussions had withered with subsequent, different games; it just took a while for us to realize it was hampering us. We also had the added benefit of not having to deal with each other at our hungriest. That was one of the best changes we ever made.<br/><br/>One thing, however, that none of my groups have ever survived: scheduling. Just going from weekly to every other week stunted the hell out of one group's games and investment.<br/>It's possible the biggest reason for some of these problems is actually scheduling - for example, it's possible the reason these numerous duties have fallen to you is because if you didn't do them, nobody else's schedules would allow them to participate. I don't know if that's true, but I've almost always found that when I felt burnout creeping up, I realized it was because without that burnout-inducing burden, the game couldn't work.<br/><br/>Opening up communication is the big step, but it's possible that communication will only make it clearer that things need to be a certain way or not at all. So don't let that new era of communication make you a victim of the pressure (internal or external) to keep a group, schedule, or particular game intact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448139/#Comment_448139" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-21T22:57:19+00:00" title="August 21, 2015 10:57PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might add (because I find the hosting customs and strategies an interesting topic) that I've seen a pretty wide range of arrangements of the practical stuff related to the cultural salon that is the rpg session over the years. Three things that I've been particularly fond of, and that may not be as common as they should:<br/><b>*</b> Playing at a suitable restaurant or pub is fun because you get fed and watered to the extent you feel like, nobody needs to clean up afterwards, and the game segues naturally to other social activities before or after. It's not absolutely superior to a private affair due to higher average expense and venue distractions, but for certain types of game and group it is the golden ticket.<br/><b>*</b> Having a "campaign secretary" who takes care of all the logistics instead of the GM is so very, very functional; it is unfortunate that gamers seem to have some cultural misconceptions that often prevent "ordinary " non-GM players from committing to a campaign to a degree where they're willing to host, negotiate schedules and deal with catering. When I've managed to appoint a secretary, whether I was GMing myself or <i>being</i> that secretary, it's always been a very worthwhile and natural distribution of duties. Nowadays my first thought about a major campaign plan concerns whether I could find an equally motivated co-pilot on whom I could hoist the secretarial duties <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><b>*</b> Further splitting off hosting from catering, particularly when the GM is hosting (which can be easiest for everybody when playing something where the GM has 40 kg of stuff they use for the game) is a very good idea. I love it when players bring food when I'm hosting, and I love to cook for the group when I'm being a player and have nothing else to do for the game; I get to show off some weird recipe, be generous, be a good example for others, get everybody fed and so on and so forth. In our summer Paranoia game I've gotten the players into a habit of bringing food by bribing them with perversity points, which has worked well for everybody concerned in the affair.<br/><br/>A remarkable dislike is that I've found that I'm not very fond of the common habit of bringing a take-away dinner to the game when you arrive. I get it that it's convenient to grab something on the way and then eat it on the premises, but I don't find it ideal from the perspective of the group - I think that we can do better, and doing better involves ensuring that <i>everybody</i> gets fed in an elegant manner, without people having to be annoyed with your food wrappers floating around, or eye your delicious sandwich enviously because they forgot to bring their own, or wait for you to finish your pizza before the game can actually start. At times this can develop into a sort of a covert one-man war between me and the habit of coming to the game table fed, with delicious and consistently available food offerings as the weapons of choice - the war goal is to get people committed to the idea that the salon logistics provide the feed, they don't need to bring their own burger doggy bag <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(For clarity, because I sound like I advocate a secret underground cooking conspiracy, I should say that I have nothing against not mixing food into gaming at all per se - I'm cool with a group that decides that the game starts after dinner, with everybody eating at home before arriving. In practice this is apparently a very rare arrangement in the busy urban landscape, and it soon degenerates into take-away dinners eaten on the premises, at which point the cooking knives come out and I start advocating for a communal dinner arrangement - if we're eating here anyway, might as well do something interesting and convenient that gets everybody fed instead of just the 40% who brought their own.)<br/><br/>The take-away from my experiences is, I think, that the more you can spread out the salon-hosting duties and particularly separate them from creative duties, the better; having them all pile up on the GM is, I think, an unnatural and immature state of affairs that has to do with cultural habits (treating the GM as a dancing bear, there for your enjoyment, to be specific) that we might desire to discard going forward. It is possible and easy (if the will is there) to separate the secretariat, hosting and catering, so I heartily recommend looking into the various possibilities for any group that feels even the slight bit mature (in the sense of having been playing together a while, I mean) - if you think that the other players actually like being there and being involved, that's the right time to start speculating about maybe splitting up the workload. It's not the answer for all groups (for example, when the GM is clearly the senior partner and leader of the group as part of e.g. a school gaming club), but for a social circle of peers it's just plain weird to not spread out the duties and ask everybody for some degree of commitment to the common affair.<br/><br/>You'll note that I use the term "salon" a lot in this context. The reason is simply that I find much to be admirable in the old European custom of the cultural salon. For example, consider this: in the cultural dynamics of the salon the host was rarely the intellectual centerpiece of the salon; rather, the host would arrange for interesting people to come in and provide the entertainment. The ideal of separating hosting from GMing in tabletop gaming arises out of the same social and practical concerns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448142/#Comment_448142" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-22T04:56:40+00:00" title="August 22, 2015  4:56AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Eero.<br/><br/>I was just about to post about how my best GMing experiences were when someone said, "I'm hosting a game night on such-and-such a day, at my place at this time. Paul, will you come run a game for us?"<br/><br/>Much like the salon concept, this works very nicely. If there is food involved, a potluck or some other plan works well, or plans to go out to eat afterwards (including a discussion or debrief after the game). <br/><br/>I've also been on the other end of it: "Ok, so-and-so wants to run a game. I'll arrange a place and time and invite everyone, and I'll make something to eat."<br/><br/>Sandra, have you ever heard of the West Marches campaign? It had an interesting premise, which was that the GM created the world (a sandbox) and ran the game, but it was the players who organized "expeditions". They would contact the GM and say, "Ok, Benjar the Bold and the Sengal the Barbarian and their three companions wish to mount an expedition to the Great White Mountains of Doom. The players are available on the 9, 10, and 11th of this month, evenings." And then the GM says, "Cool, I'll run that session on the 10th. See you at my place."<br/><br/>So the players take care of the scheduling, and whoever is available goes on that particular mission/expedition. <br/><br/>Wouldn't work as well with a typical "party"-style campaign as it does with a stable of characters. (And perhaps players who compete to advance their character faster than others!)<br/><br/>If you want to read about it, you can Google it pretty easily, I'm sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448143/#Comment_448143" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-22T05:30:17+00:00" title="August 22, 2015  5:30AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had the West Marches concept in mind from day one, when I started LMoP I've accepted drop ins, missed weeks, and people being late.

They come to your game because they ENJOY IT.  Stop trying to find excuses for why people come to your game.  It's because it is fun.<br/><br/>Also, scheduling. People need to know about <a href="http://doodle.com/" rel="nofollow">Doodle</a>.  You don't have to spend tons of time texting/emailing/sending smoke signals/etc.  Nor do you need to write your own scheduling website (Holy crap, no! Talk about unnecessary GM workload.).  Doodle is free and it works VERY well.  You fill in the dates and times at which you are prepared to run the game.  You lay down a basic rule like "We will play at the time the most people can make it, ties will be broken in favor of the earliest session (because the sooner you play, the sooner you can start scheduling the next game.)."  You send the thing. Everyone takes like 15 seconds to click on the times they can make it.   And you get a chart.  Use it, folks, it's free.<br/><br/>I find it a little bit remarkable that GMing remains to tied to hosting, also.  Our usual method for determining who hosts is "Who has the nicest space?" tempered with "How far is the GM willing to drive?" and with some exceptions for "Well, I really can't game at places other than my house because I have to be on hand in case of a Baby Emergency, so could people come here?"  None of which really have anything to do with being the GM.   I guess we USED to have a "GM hosts" default, but that probably came from the idea that it's easier to start a game group by saying "Who wants to come over here and play ?" than it is to say "Who wants to all descend on 's place and play ?"   Of course, this is easily solved by talking to Person X, and saying "Hey, I want to run a game;  You have an awesome game space.  Can I talk you into hosting?" before you send out the main invite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448158/#Comment_448158" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-22T16:40:38+00:00" title="August 22, 2015  4:40PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2015 4:52PM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://autonomo.us/2008/07/14/franklin-street-statement/" rel="nofollow">Doodle is NOT FREE!!!!!!!!!</a><br/>The scheduling website I set up I based on <a href="https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/" rel="nofollow">a Ruby program that has a similar interface to Doodle, but is open source</a>.

Our most busy group member sometimes arrived after dinner, because he had to pick up his kids at school, but I always made an effort to join the dinner. I'm vegan, and even though I offered to bring my own stuff or help out cooking, this player always prepared (delicious) vegan food on his own for the whole group. I guess it helps that he's vegetarian, but the whole group enjoyed his cooking.<br/><br/>A bonus was that when you have kids, as I have, the opportunities to meet people just to socialize are a lot more constrained, so this was a great outlet. During dinner we would discuss anything, both RPG related or work related or whatever, but never the current game. That made the switch from just hanging out to playing the current game very clear.<br/><br/>I tried to carry this over to my Whitehack group (no player overlap with the previous group) when we started playing, but we play at a player's office, so we had to eat out. That meant we could either go to a regular restaurant and I could order what's available off-menu (a vegetarian pizza without cheese, pasta and tomato sauce, or something), or we could go to a vegan restaurant where I would feel responsible for the other players' experience.<br/><br/>Some people find vegetarian or vegan food lacking, and I didn't want to enforce this on everyone each time we met. The setup now is that people can meet and eat before the game if they want to, but then they schedule it themselves on our mailing list. I usually show up after dinner to just play, mostly because I don't find eating in a loud restaurant nearly as relaxing as eating at someone's home, and because of the vegan options. So we have two or three players who sometimes eat together before the game and two players who never do it. Sometimes people bring food to the game and eat at the start of the session, but since the arrangement is that you're supposed to arrive fed, I don't think anyone watches these people longingly. People usually bring a sandwich or something quick.<br/><br/>Most of my gaming groups haven't had a fixed schedule. In high school and at the university I would play as often as possible. After graduation it would go a couple of weeks after a session until someone got restless and started to schedule the next session. Numerous emails and Doodles later we would find a time two weeks away when everyone was available at the same time. It was not ideal. Doodle-like scheduling is far better than plain emails though.<br/><br/>In my current Whitehack group we've always played every other Thursday, and it's been perfect. I was very inspired by West Marches when I set it up, and exactly like you do, when players are missing their characters just disappear for a session and we come up with an explanation when they get back. Usually their character will guard the horses outside of the dungeon, or wander the already explored corridors or something. In my game the players themselves divide both XP and gold between the characters, and missing players usually get something, but not as much as the players attending.<br/><br/>The thing with the two-week schedule is that even when I feel some burnout after a session that didn't go as well as I wanted - perhaps I messed up some part of the pre-written module or made a judgment call I regret, two weeks is long enough for me to miss the game and look forward to it again. I also enjoy that the game just "appears" in my calendar at the start of the week and I can look forward to it without having to get people to reply and divulge their schedules.<br/><br/>I imagine being in a situation where player A, B, and C can play on one day, and player B, C, and D can play on another is stressful. How do you decide if player A or D get to play, if you're available to play both days? We've had players who wanted to join our game, but said that Thursdays wouldn't work, which meant they automatically disqualified themselves. I didn't have to try to find a date to suit them as well as the rest of the group, which was nice.<br/><br/>The only real problem with our current setup is that the come-if-you-can attitude makes the number of players fluctuate. At the moment, if everyone attends, we're five players plus GM. Last session three players had other stuff to do, and the final two didn't want to risk killing their characters by taking on the module on their own, so they cancelled. I sometimes suggest GM something else if we're down to two players, but now we've specified that we'll play Dungeon World (I haven't played yet, want to try it!) or B/X if we're down to two players. We've also recruited a new player, so now the risk is instead six players each session, which is the upper limit for me.<br/><br/>The above is a description of things that has happened to me and how I've tried to solve it, so please take what you can from it. I don't want to give you specific suggestions on how to handle your situation, because I don't know enough about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448190/#Comment_448190" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-23T16:22:03+00:00" title="August 23, 2015  4:22PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2015 4:54PM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Jonas.<br/><small>I see you on the vegan thing.

Whenever my friends are hosting a game, I show up with something to share with the group, and generally the kinds of things that I think they'll all enjoy. <br/><br/><b>The Sunday Afternoon Game</b><br/><br/>My friend runs a biweekly (Sunday afternoon) Pathfinder campaign. We have about six players, and generally one or two of us can't make it, but three or four is sufficient for most games.<br/><br/>People never show up empty-handed for this group.<br/><br/>Of the group, three are often dieting. Two of them do low-carb. Another is diabetic. So what happened? People started bringing healthier snacks: cheese and meats, nuts, guacamole dip, and so on (generally, stuff everyone there could enjoy). Yeah, sure, there's still the usual junk food here and there, but no one feels left out.<br/><br/>The GM does feed us, but he always does a crock-pot dish that's easy and cheap. He's stated that he's happy to pay for the food since he hates to travel and some of us are driving a good distance to get there (it's 31 miles/50 km for me) and gas is expensive. <br/><br/><b>The Tuesday Evening Game</b><br/><br/>We play a different biweekly game at his house (rotation of different indie games). Only a few players in common with the Sunday game. I tend to GM these nights.<br/><br/>Because it's a Tuesday evening, the host has already eaten before the game but a few of us come right from work. We order pizza or Chinese delivery. Sometimes it's only me, or a few of us. Sometimes I just cover the food for one of the people who has a smaller budget. It all works out and isn't a "thing."<br/><br/>We often do show up empty-handed for this. It's a shorter game, and we know that if we're hungry, the players should handle calling for food to be delivered.<br/><br/>This group has been together longer than the Sunday one. In the Tuesday group, we have all known each other for at least 8 years now and we've gotten to be more than just gaming friends. I think that's probably part of why we're more relaxed about showing up empty-handed, though we'd stop doing that if any of us ever sensed it was an issue. None of us want to take advantage of our host.<br/><br/>Mind you, I hosted the Tuesday group for many years before we switched to the current host's house. <br/><br/><b>Friction</b><br/><br/>The one point of continual friction with this group is the GMing duties. The idea of the Tuesday group is "we try out an indie games for a session or three, then switch to a new one." That was fun for a while, but I'm really feeling the burn-out around learning and prepping new games--especially when I prep a game and they all go "Nah" after they've tacitly agreed through prior discussion that we'll play it.<br/><br/>I actually got to the point where I told them I was done GMing and it was someone else's turn. Like I said, we are close friends and we can talk about stuff like this. Everyone agreed that it was unfair for me to own all the GMing responsibility. Two of the others agreed to run games. Both flaked out. We cancelled a bunch of sessions as a result.<br/><br/>I love GMing. I just hate constantly switching to a new game. Especially if it's literally a NEW GAME that I just bought, have to read and understand, and have to run cold. That puts a really huge burden on me. Every so often, I have a new game I'm itching to run, so I pitch it to them, but I don't want to do this every two weeks.<br/><br/>Now I tell them what I'm willing to run. This late summer, I told them I was willing to run Sorcerer, gave them a pitch for a short campaign of 3-5 sessions, and they agreed. I've run (and played) Sorcerer before but needed to refresh my memory. Mostly, though, it's what interests me the most at this time. <br/><br/>If they flake or lose interest, there would be no game unless someone else steps up to the plate. Luckily, they seem to be into it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448199/#Comment_448199" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-24T17:47:12+00:00" title="August 24, 2015  5:47PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://autonomo.us/2008/07/14/franklin-street-statement/" rel="nofollow">Doodle is NOT FREE!!!!!!!!!</a></blockquote>\n[...]<br/>You can make a case for "I want to own my own data" but that is a different argument.

There just wasn't a good enough way of doing it to make it worthwhile; someone inevitably ends up shouldering more of the burden (labor, cost, organization, whatever) than someone else, which can be fine for a little while but eventually burns them out.<br/><br/>And since our typical game session is only about 2-3 hours at most anyway, it's not like anyone's going to be wracked with hunger pangs at the halfway point. You just eat before you come over to play, or if you're coming straight from work you can grab something quick along the way and eat it before play starts. Just getting together to play something is special enough, we don't need to break bread together (symbolically or otherwise) to make it an occasion. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448226/#Comment_448226" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-25T21:32:32+00:00" title="August 25, 2015  9:32PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Accounting points out something I've noticed as well, namely that the particular social arrangements of the play space tend to come and go; we're not talking about something you settle on for life. If I had to pin a schedule on it, in my experience we're talking about cycles of like 3-6 months at a go; basically, a given campaign or campaign season goes along with a given specific arrangement of who does what, and then there's an inevitable shuffle for the sake of variety if not because the player base shifts or the game moves to a different place.<br/><br/>Food has been more common in the specific arrangements I've seen over the last decade than not, though. The most minimalistic crews tend to be proge hipster gamers (all sorts of weird diets compared to your more conservatively geeky adventure gamer, if I'm allowed a peculiar generalization), but even those will usually settle in a pattern of bringing fruit and nuts and flavoured mineral water as a bare baseline to a nominally foodless game night; sort of replaces the traditional junk food option of chips and Coke, which otherwise seems pretty ubiquitous - I'd have to specifically forbid it to prevent those things from materializing <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The key to making the collective catering work is basically that you need somebody in the group to enjoy hosting and/or cooking so that it doesn't feel like a chore so much as an interesting way to enrich the social dimensions of the experience. It's a common hobby - if I was a family man with more reasons to cook, I probably would characterize it as an actual hobby myself, for example - so it's no wonder that gaming groups with some sort of catering arrangements are pretty common. Sort of like how it is common to play music at a sit-together, because many people like music, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

<br/><br/>The closest I've gotten to an ideal playing space was a conference room at my university. Private, conveniently located for most of the players, few distractions, designed for collaborative work. It helped there was a break room next door, though food was usually resolved either before or after the session, which you can do when most of the players are nocturnal graduate students.<br/><br/>Absent having enough space at my home to host it, I think my ideal setup would be some kind of private back room at a restaurant, though I've yet to find one with an arrangement that's private enough and affordable enough. (Also, I'd ban all screens.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20326/rpg-burnout" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20326/rpg-burnout" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20326/rpg-burnout/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20326%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20326%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
