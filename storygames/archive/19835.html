What do the NPCs think of them as?<br/><br/>So, here:\n<blockquote>You're an NPC.  You live in a village not too far from a border with warlike monsters.  You and your fellow villagers have trained in fighting since you were children, but you are poor and have very little metal -- most of your equipment consists of spears and bows.  If the monsters attack, your biggest and strongest fighters will buy the rest of the village time to flee to the nearest fort.<br/><br/>Your village is part of the Western Empire, and the Imperial Army will come to repel monsters once the alarm is raised.  They are an impressive force, with metal weapons and armor.  You're used to seeing a few of them for mail delivery and at roadhouses when you travel.  You are too far from the center of the empire to have a large force close by, though; they defend the border, but they can't have a man stationed every few feet for the whole thing.  <br/><br/>In the advent of an attack, once the Army arrives, any monsters that are simply flesh and blood will be pretty much toast.  Unfortunately, there are other creatures out there, creatures that Imperial soldiers simply don't know how to deal with.  That's where _____ come in.<br/><br/>_____ are unique people who take on supernatural problems the Empire can't fathom, for a fee.  Usually working in groups of 3-4, _____ will generally hear about a village's troubles from some Imperial messenger, and then agree upon compensation with the nearest garrison.  The _____ will then enter the village and try to first get to the heart of the problem, and then cast out the supernatural affliction.  <br/><br/>_____ have an uncanny understanding of Evil supernatural forces.  Some _____ may be among the most passionate adversaries of Evil, while others may grow too close to the darkness for their own good.  Peering too deeply into the supernatural is not good for the minds of Men; _____ may have special abilities to weather these encounters, but it's hard to imagine that any could walk away completely unaffected.  _____ are strange; they are warriors, but are not always the biggest, or strongest, or in their prime years.  They tend to carry strange items.  Some hide their work from the villagers, while others may recruit an entire village for some task, plus perhaps even the local earl or baron!  Tales abound of the deeds of _____, mostly of the heroic and swashbuckling sort, but others of cleverness or even tragedy.  It is rumored that some _____ have even become evil wizards after doing the job for too long, or with too little distaste for the supernatural.<br/><br/>There have been some strange omens and disappearances in your village lately.  As the Empire seems passive on this front, you are hopeful that some _____ will come.  Your village's problem probably only rates a novice group of _____, not any famous outfit you've heard of.  If _____ do come, you intend to be as helpful to them as you possibly can, the better to save your village.  At the same time, you will probably watch them with more than normal scrutiny, alert to signs both good and bad.</blockquote>\nCan you fill in the blank for me?

I like Stephen's 'Ravens' suggestion, but I would just strip off the 'order' part. 'Crows' makes a good variation as well, though obviously it has that derivative thing going on.

Well, plus an extra bit of <b>differentiation from the local medicine man/woman</b>.  Some more info:<br/><br/>Every village has an elder who can dress wounds, give out good luck charms, pray for the gods' blessing, and perform all sorts of folk remedies.  But everyone knows that a medicine man/woman's prayers and rituals are insufficient to fight a potent supernatural menace. For that, experts are required, people who have gleaned insight from facing down demonic horrors, the kind of insight you can't get any other way.<br/><br/><b>One minor note:</b><br/><br/>I think I want a name in English; that's what I use for everything in the game except proper names.

Either would work as the singular dash of pretentiousness in an otherwise straight telling.<br/><br/>I like the concept of "cunning", "kenning" in English myself, as it pertains to knowledge of the eldritch and the unusual. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunning_folk" rel="nofollow">Cunningfolk</a> is one of those terms indicating local medicine men. You could conceivably reserve "medicine man" or "local healer" for the more mundane sort, and call the heroic variety of supernatural investigator a "cunningman" or "kenningman" - one who knows the supernatural evil first-hand. Sounds cool to me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the aforelinked article has an interesting factoid I didn't know before: apparently in Cornwall these sorts of people have at some point been called "pellars" or "expellers" (of the evil spirits), which would seem like a fit term for an Anglo-rooted fantasy linguistic choice. Again, sounds cool.<br/><br/>I guess my standard for what sounds cool here is whether it'd fit well into a morose folk song <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439798/#Comment_439798" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-30T01:59:51+00:00" title="October 30, 2014  1:59AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this set in the same world as _Delve_?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439799/#Comment_439799" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-30T02:03:39+00:00" title="October 30, 2014  2:03AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This <i>is</i> Delve!

I think something with less melodrama than the bard's options but with more flair than "expellers" would be ideal.<br/><br/>Paul's idea of a non-obvious etymology, like "horns" for horned helmets, might have potential.  I'm trying to think of what separates _____ from other folks, and it's hard to come up with anything visual.  Beginning _____ look like peasants, while veteran _____ can look more badass than Imperial officers.  Most of the other stuff, I've already covered: _____ are generally smart, brave, know weird stuff, and have weird items.  A few of these weird items may recur, though most peasants wouldn't know this -- nasty reddish root plants that quell fever dreams, sharp fragments of a bright, shiny, metallic rock, and decks of prophetic cards used in tarot-style "readings" of supernatural problems.<br/><br/>Finally, there's an angle I hadn't previously thought of, which is the cosmic or mythological.  This world includes a dim and erratic second moon, known to the Imperials as Triculum, which is associated with Mismor, god of stone, secrets, wisdom, cold and the North.  Triculum, the Sun, the Moon and the Gods are generally thought to be on the side of humanity, while the stars are Evil and a threat that mankind must banish at seasonal rituals.<br/><br/>So, some ideas from all that:<br/>Star-gazers<br/>Star-stalkers<br/>Orrers (taken from orrery, the solar system model; I like the sound)<br/>Mismor's Hounds<br/>Secret-keepers<br/>Card-holders<br/>Root-eaters<br/>Diviners<br/><br/>Not loving those, but maybe they'll inspire other thoughts...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439917/#Comment_439917" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T20:59:53+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  8:59PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a subtle name: "The called"<br/><br/>Much as ministers and missionaries feel god "calls" them to service, maybe these ____ are "called" to hunting the strange and fighting the others.<br/><br/>And just like how ministers and missionaries are defined by their activities and objects (travel, preaching, and a bible), maybe "the called" are also so defined.

"The empire isn't helping; I hope they send some of the Called."  "Elder, a group of the Called has arrived and they seek a meeting."  "One of the Called told me to keep away from this stream."  It's just awkward always having to use "the", and not having an available group noun.  "I hope they send Expellers", "Expellers have arrived", "An Expeller told me" -- much easier.<br/><br/>Is there a group noun for people who have been called?  Receivers, Signalees, Recruits, Converts, Answerers, Heeders... I dunno.<br/><br/>Actually, random inspiration: village shamans refer to _____ as Heeders of the Call, which was the original name for the job.  Subsequently, the shorthand "Heeders" was used, which someone jokingly misheard as "Heaters" when some _____ defeated a famous monster using fire.  That group already had a name, so "Heaters" was broadly applied to them and people who acted like them -- Heeders of the Call who did bold and dramatic deeds.  <br/><br/>So now most villagers refer to _____ as Heaters.  For _____ themselves, it's kind of an inside joke -- you're not <i>really</i> Heaters until your first really crazy mission with lots of upheaval.  Until then, you're, I dunno, Embers or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439945/#Comment_439945" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T09:07:44+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  9:07AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2014 9:08AM by AsIf.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you guys have <i>nailed</i> it!
