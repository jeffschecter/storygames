I had actually been thinking on the drive home from Gencon about hacking <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> to turn it into the game I wanted, but instead I decided to <a href="http://simonjrogers.livejournal.com/115307.html" rel="nofollow">embrace TOC</a> as the game it is. But when Nathan's contest came up, and I got assigned the title "Piper at the Gates of Dawn," the name immediately evoked the idea for a "game of weird tales" revolving around the notion of an unseen world intruding upon the world we know. <br/><br/>The write-up starts by juxtaposing an excerpt from <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> (whence the title "Piper at the Gates of Dawn") where Rat and Mole encounter Pan in the woods and are overcome with wonder with one from Arthur Machen's <i>The Great God Pan</i> where the mad scientist explains that "seeing the god Pan" was the ancients' term for going beyond the illusion of the world and seeing things as they are. Then there's a long prefatory introduction that tries to establish the niche the game is meant to occupy: slipstream Lovecraft; or, in other words, 21st century cosmic horror that strives for something more than pastiche Yog-Sothothery.<br/><br/>The rules themselves come in two sections. The first is called "We Are Not Meant to Know," which tells the GM to prepare a scenario that starts with an interesting historical moment -- Shanghai 1937, Berlin 1949, and so forth -- and weave weird elements into it by means of the "slipstream" technique of "quoting" the historical record, chopping it up out of context and introducing the pieces in novel ways. So the example in the rules takes the confrontation between the Nationalist Chinese and the Japanese in Shanghai 1937 and adds in the revenant younger Son of God of the Taiping Rebellion and the oracular spirit of the I Ching as unseen antagonists below the surface conflict. The implication is not that you as GM-reader will run this scenario; rather, it's that you'll prepare the one that punches your buttons, whether that's a retelling of James Gleick's <i>Chaos</i> as Lovecraftian parable or the story of a small-town Yuletide Ragnarok, with Santa Claus/Loki as a dark elf trickster returning from exile at the North Pole with his horde of changeling children.<br/><br/>The second section of the rules is called "Lifting the Veil" and it presents what is mainly an engine for turning what players enact in role-playing into a game-mechanical currency of weirdness and normalcy. My solution to the problem of musical resolution is either cleverness or casuistry: I envision an instance of character action in-game as a musical note, and the reaction of another character as a responding note, which may resonate in consonance or dissonance with each other. Consonance produces a currency of normalcy, dissonance a currency of weirdness. At the end of an interaction, normal currency gets distributed in an Otherkind fashion to decide who wins narration rights, how successful the active character was in achieving their intention, and whether either character is transformed positively or negatively in the process. Weird currency moves events along one or more weirdness tracks that bring the world unseen into contact with the one we know, or gets absorbed by the characters as increasingly "unusual psychological attributes" -- i.e., madness.<br/><br/>The tricky part was in matching character actions to the notes on a scale, but I relied on the notion that sound is a wave just like light (I know, I know) and thus the colors of the spectrum can be more or less mapped onto the scale. And thus only a little squinting was needed to match the behaviors associated with auras of different colors with the notes on a scale. In play, someone will have to judge which behavior is actually being demonstrated, but that adds rather than detracts from the fun, in my opinion: it makes role-playing central to the game-mechanics. No mere parlor-narration this!<br/><br/>And that's the game. The procedures of play still need some fine-tuning, I think: for example, maybe an interaction should be a chain of exchanges in which the reaction  of the "interlocutor" (reacting character) to the initiator's action becomes the initial action of the sequel exchange; the length of the chain could then be tied either to the fiction or to the accumulation of currency (e.g., you spend 1 point from your accumulated normal currency or accrue 1 point of weirdness for each time beyond the first that you react during the game-turn). But conceptually I think it's neat, a kind of impressionistic game design written from a self-consciously literary perspective. That will turn some people off, I know -- oy! the pretense! -- but for me it was fun.<br/><br/>If anyone is interested, I'll run a playtest of the game at Dreamation in February. The game strikes me as ideal for convention play: the GM spends time prepping a fairly detailed one-short scenario that can be picked up and played by anyone (no detailed rules knowledge required), with enormous replay value since entirely different characters can be played each time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240861/#Comment_240861" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T22:00:23+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 10:00PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
