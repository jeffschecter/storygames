I get to this part about King somebody-or-other and his Gunknights.  &lt;boing&gt; I don't have any idea what the heck they are but I know whatever they are that's what I'm gonna be.  I'm already calling up images of King's Roland crossed with a Paladin.  And immediately I start thinking..."Gunknights need armor...I wonder if this game has armor".  So now the image in my head is Roland crossed with a Paladin crossed with Iron Man and I'm flipping through the book looking for armor.  "Oh...here's the Trait you have to take to be a Gunknight...and here's something called 'Siege Armor' they get for free.."  And while I'm flipping around I find the trait for Landed Nobility which instructs me to flip to some other page and roll up a settlement.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;bing&gt; so now my guy is Lord Redguard the Hammer of Dessereck.  Cuz I saw some place named Red Canyon flipping around the book.  And I'm figuring that Dessereck is some place where some people were holed up Alamo style and the King's army couldn't root them out until I led the assault that breached their defenses.  "Oh look, here's a picture of some Yeti looking dudes...Bruta...yeah...those guys.  I totally whooped up on a bunch of those guys."  Now I need a cool gun, cuz if you're gonna have some kick ass armor you need a kick ass gun.  &lt;flip&gt; &lt;flip&gt; &lt;flip&gt;  Ooohhh here's a cool gun.  Ooohh this one's cool too.   Ooohh maybe I need one of these. &lt;flip&gt; "what's this...its wicked cool...its called a Jackhammer...hey my guy is the 'Hammer' of Dessereck this gun is made for me...what's it do...hey its the standard issue weapon for Gunknights.<br/>\nGET OUT OF MY HEAD!!!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166087/#Comment_166087" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T09:20:34+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  9:20AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My impression of the game at GenCon was "heavy game that maybe could be really interesting to me, but would probably take too much of an investment of time, so I'm going to keep my investigations to a minimum"<br><br>This?

A wicked collection of Traits to build your character out of, some of which are Unique and actually tie you directly into the setting and important NPCs (the one where there's this Angel chick who's fallen in love with you and now you're being hunted by the church for corrupting her is especially cool...but there's also one where your friends with the ghost of some kid who follows you around and tells you stuff...or the one where the Grey Man is after you and you don't know why).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the weapons all have Traits that have mechanical impact some are good like Armor Piercing and some not so good like Recoil which makes you lose an action before you can fire the gun.  But you can upgrade the guns and add new traits or buy off bad ones and stuff and that seems cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there's some cool random encounter generators when you try to travel overland from place to place and run into enemy patrols and stuff and bits where time passes and the war continues and when you get places you find its been conquered by the enemy and then you can muster armies to go take it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut while I was reading it a few red flags went up for me.  The core system is a pretty simple d20 roll under system (and I tend to be biased against linear distribution curves), but the highest stat my character starts with (barring using Traits to buy it up) is 12.  That's like a 60% chance to succeed at the things I'm best at?  Whispers of the Whifftastic Basic Roleplaying System start dancing in my head.  I have a pretty low tolerance for whiffage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there's other stuff in the game that harder to evaluate.  There are medals you can earn that you can trade in for a bunch of stuff, including auto success.  But its hard to judge how fast and furious the medals flow...whether they're so rare that don't really help with the whiffage except once in a while...or so common that you can auto succeed pretty often...even for skills you're not good at.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd its also possible to raise stats...basically any roll that ties your score gives you another level.  But on a d20 you could make 40 rolls in a session and statistically only raise 2 skills...and I can't remember the last game that I had to make 40 rolls in a session for...so I don't know how fast that really is.  And you can also train and get a free roll for everything to try and level something but I don't have a feel for how often that happens in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso injury is pretty brutal.  If you take damage you're down, unable to do anything but crawl away.  More damage and you're "gored" unable to do even that and you have the choice to either die or live with a scar (which is pretty cool).  I can't tell if the system is as random as it looks on first blush, and if that combined with the damage rules will turn the game into "flip a coin to see if you die today".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's the direction of my current questions.  Currently just red warning flags, because there's enough stuff going on in the system that its hard to evaluate how all the interactions actually play out.  So...how do they actually play out?  What does the system do to make your character more badass than a 60% chance to succeed would suggest?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166093/#Comment_166093" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T09:35:14+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  9:35AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Clint, if you happen to stop by, why does the Empire of Dust ad <a href="http://www.knrpg.com/" rel="nofollow">on your webpage</a> (NOT really worksafe) currently feature a woman preparing to have sex with a chainsaw?

Whiff factor <i>can</i> be an issue (especially if you're sensitive to it), but is largely balanced out by the way medals work.  Get used to bantering during combat (which takes some getting used to) and it's a good idea to give your character a trait that will allow him to gain medals outside of combat.    Medals tend to flow pretty fast and furious.  If, after you take it for a spin, the whiff factor is too high for you, there are two easy solutions:  1)  start the PCs off as "elites" (Base score 16, or 80% success rate at your best stats) or 2) start the PCs with two medals instead of one.  <br><br>Injury is also largely balanced out by medals.  That said, it's also good to snatch up traits like "I Will Not Be Broken!"  or "Final Stand" to mitigate the effects of being wounded.  Still, it's pretty brutal stuff.  Characters <i>will</i> go down from time to time.  We try to use characters being gored to spark new, interesting situations (as per the defeat table).  Also . . . use cover!<br><br>Epiphanies <i>are</i> very random.  Again, some people will hate this.  We found that for our tastes it's really fun and instills each stat roll with a lot of tension.<br><br>We pushed the system toward extremes, and it's definitely not for everyone . . . but it's a lot of fun if it <i>is</i> your cup o tea.  Let me know if you come up with more questions!<br><br>To Jonathan: <br>That's "The Widow."  It's a unique trait that you can take in the game.  It's also a tongue-in-cheek response to the idea that RPGs should strive to be politically correct in their artwork.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166536/#Comment_166536" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T21:56:18+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  9:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Widow seems really out of place on that page.

My answer was just me being honest about our intent with the art.  Amy did the piece, and I was like "Oh my . . . that's going piss people off . . . let's put it on the back cover."

Yeah, those conversations bug me too, but probably for different reasons.  Generally the parts I find most grating are the inevitable "I don't see anything problematic about this, so therefore your feelings are invalid" response, and I think it's really awesome that you didn't go there.  Like many people have discussed lately, I think we, as a publishing community, are bad at figuring out how to both give and accept criticism while holding fast to the principle that people should publish whatever makes them happy. Controversial content and images falls directly into that category. So, yeah, I'm right with you for saying "Forget what other people think, I'm gonna publish what I want, how I want it!" but also over here going "Ooo, that makes me uncomfortable and may help support persisting sexism; I wish you had made a different choice."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166624/#Comment_166624" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:18:15+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:18AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we're on exactly the same page.

As the creator of the piece I can honestly say that like any art, it was made to evoke response but more important illustrate a specific idea.  This idea was the concept of what I imagined "The Widow" to be.  Originally, the Widow was just supposed to be interior art, but during the creation process we decided that we need to prompt a response with our game.  It seems the best way to do that is to go with the utmost extreme.  Lo and behold, the Widow on the back cover.  I love how it turned out.  (obviously, I created the damned thing)  But even funnier, the version of the Widow on the back isn't even the original.  We decided to tone the original down a notch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that said, I'm not advocating sexism.  I find the whole thing a very touchy subject that over forums always seems to end, as Jonathan pointed out, in a flame war.  I hate the internet for uber serious discussion like that and am more than willing to hand out my phone number to anybody who wants to have a serious discussion.  I am though, an advocate for imagination and putting yourself out there.  This is something that I created and I am more than willing to suffer the consequences for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if my art provokes a response from you, good or bad, then I have done my job as an artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this is from the same chick that hates walls, therefore collaborating to create an entire game where you can blow them up, so take from it what you will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166695/#Comment_166695" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T16:55:55+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  4:55PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Knowing what The Widow is, I think your piece does a great job of capturing the concept, Amy.

So many RPG books feature objectified female stereotypes in their art (especially on covers) to the point where it's a pretty tired cliche. Browsing to the EoD web page for the first time (knowing nothing of the context for the art) makes me roll my eyes and go "Oh, great. More pseudo S&amp;M cheesecake.

Unique Traits are traits that are only available to one character in the entire setting.  Thus once taken, no other character can take that specific Unique Trait.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband Aurthur, whom you loved dearly, was brutally killed in front of you, and in your dementia you project the personality of Aurthur in your super sexy weapon, the Steingratz Killchain.  The Killchain is a huge friggin' Chainsaw.  You have conversations with Aurthur and he often tempts you to commit horrid acts of violence that usually ends up in delicious blood bath parties.

Amy's art is great (as in "call her up the next time I need illustration work" great).  But having The Widow on your back cover doesn't really, in my opinion, distinguish EoD from all the crappy games out there that put cheesecake on their covers -- in order to sell way more copies than their crappy game deserves.  It says "more of the same" to me, not "oh, here's something really new and different."  It's not just, as John says, that the picture is completely without the context it would have to someone who's read the game, but it's that it exists within the context of the wider roleplaying culture, where sexism is used to sell a lot of really terrible stuff.  Honestly, I had the same reaction to the title of Panty Explosion, which I imagine gets a ton of sales from people thinking it's something that it's not.<br/><br/>I totally believe that neither Amy nor Clint is interested in promoting sexism or anything like that.  Unfortunately, the way roleplaying culture is right now, I just think the back cover of EoD encourages customers to associate it with a large swath of roleplaying that knowingly or obliviously promotes sexism.  Even if that earns you folks a bunch of additional sales (as I think it did for Jake), that makes me sad, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166746/#Comment_166746" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-03T07:06:47+00:00" title="September  3, 2008  7:06AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2008 7:07AM by fnord3125.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, but check this out, Jonathan.

The points on the map are called "waypoints."  They are an abstract representation of the more important, defined regions of the game-world.  Characters travel across the world along the abstract routes denoted by the dotted lines that connect adjacent waypoints.  When you want to travel to an adjacent waypoint, you make a navigation roll.  Success means you're there.  Failure triggers a random encounter.  You keep trying (and having encounters) until you succeed.  The encounters cover all kinds of stuff like enemy patrols, settlements, military outposts, weather, etc . . . Essentially, it's a thinly veiled situation generator.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, and the "Kimo" thing, that's awesome!  Amy will get a kick out of that.

The title is meant to speak to people who are interested in the genre. These people understand the conventions of the genre and understand the implications of the name. If the name of the game is really a turn off, then you are very likely also not a fan of the genre the game is meant to emulate. <br/><br/>I can easily imagine a similar case with Empires. Of course there will be some people who won't buy Panty Explosion because of the name or Empires of Dust because of this art, but this is a problem any game is going to run into. In trying to appeal to one audience you turn off another. I don't see anything wrong with that.

When you attempt to cater to everybody's taste, you also tend to fall into the zone of mediocrity, as Clint mentioned earlier.  When you take a solid stance or display something controversial not everybody is going to accept it.

Like, "Hey, I'm really bothered by this thing and wanted to point it out" and then the response is "Don't censor me!  Don't tell me what to do!  If you don't like my game, that's fine; don't buy it!"  I think that's about as productive as annoyed customers going "I can't believe you did that with the game!  You should change it right away!"  I'm not asking anyone to do anything.  I'm saying "This bothers me a lot" and creators can take that into consideration or not, and I can continue to buy / play their games or not, whatever else happens.  If I'm not part of the target audience for a game, then I'll probably end up having to expend more effort to make it work for me.  That's a cost I can choose to pay or not.  I can definitely still respect people and strongly disagree with the decisions (including artistic / marketing decisions) that they make.<br/><br/>I do think it's possible, though, that the decisions we make have unintended consequences that may or may not have been fully considered before we make them.  If that's not the case in these particular instances, if all possible reactions were accounted for and decisions were made anyway, cool.  But, honestly, I think it's pretty impossible to account for everything. John and I shared the same reaction in this case, so it's likely many other people did as well.  How many?  Who knows.  Would you have made a different choice, given this thread?  Maybe not.  That's not for me to decide and it sounds like it's too late for this particular case, anyway.  But I do think it's important to have conversations like this so that people can make better informed decisions in the future, even if the decisions themselves don't change.

Good luck with that!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168587/#Comment_168587" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T23:02:06+00:00" title="September 11, 2008 11:02PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noted! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron%20Hamric" title="Aaron Hamric"><img alt="Aaron Hamric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img156.imageshack.us/my.php?image=goplehtr2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron%20Hamric">Aaron Hamric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168709/#Comment_168709" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T13:00:19+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  1:00PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will second the notion that the back of box text/art is painfully eye-straining.

I offered critique of the piece first and foremost from the perspective of someone who does book design and art direction. I don't think The Widow image communicates what the game is about -- which is a problem from a marketing/design perspective (I level the same critique at the D&amp;D4 covers, which have a similar problem). Andy makes a great point about the darkness/contrast of the colors, too.<br/><br/>The <i>content</i> of the piece is a separate issue -- wholly in the realm of the taste and judgment of Clint and Amy, which I don't want to question or impugn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Amy%20Garcia" title="Amy Garcia"><img alt="Amy Garcia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Amy%20Garcia">Amy Garcia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168912/#Comment_168912" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-13T19:02:53+00:00" title="September 13, 2008  7:02PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, this may sound strange, but if we did an entire box-set and the only thing (so far) that are (for a lack of a better phrase) valid points of critique are the image of the Widow and the darkness of the boxset...<br/><br/>I'm pretty damned happy about that.  <br/><br/>This is my first big deal gig, so honestly, I'm just ecstatic that it's finally out there.

I'm pretty interested right now in what is the "right thing to say" to get me (or somebody else, for that matter) to pick a game up and give attention and perhaps even a buy to that particular game. (I wrote about that yesterday <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2008/09/13/positive-surprises-from-gencon/" rel="nofollow">at my blog</a>.) For what it's worth, if somebody had explained that map mechanic to me at Gencon, I'd have bought this game just on that basis. The same for the setting-unique traits.<br/><br/>As it was, I did look at Clint's games and he told me a bit about them, but as I remember it, the only thing I took with me about the <i>Empire of Dust</i> was that it's a boxed set and Clint uses the same house system he used for <i>Bizenghast</i>. The convention being chock-full of mediocre fantasy games with generic systems, me not knowing Clint's level as a designer at all (really, first time I heard about him, as far as I know), I didn't feel like buying a big game with a house system. (I instead bought Roanoke and Urchin, which convinced me post-convention that I'll need to start paying attention to Clint Krause.)<br/><br/>Anyway, to complete this customer survey: if I'd even noticed the chainsaw babe when looking at the game, it'd have strengthened my initial impression of mediocre geek adventure game, just like similar art in <i>Dread: 1stBoP</i> did. In the latter's case I fortuitously happened on a cool bit of the book (the demon descriptions) on my own when checking it out, so ended up carrying a load of them with me. <i>Empire of Dust</i>, on the other hand, slipped through my fingers this time.<br/><br/>As for the political correctness or whatever, I'll go with Jonathan - it's a straw man, and irrelevant to whether customers like what you're doing. If your customers do, that's swell, but I for one would have misinterpreted the game's quality and its cachet if I'd have judged on the basis of its art. It's an interesting challenge to try to figure out the right things to say about a game to sell it, not the least because there are so many different market segments out there. I'd have nabbed the game right away if Clint had harped on the bits that I find cool, but then, how could he have known what the cool thing would be for me? That's quite a challenge for anybody trying to sell a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192630/#Comment_192630" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-15T06:48:20+00:00" title="February 15, 2009  6:48AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.<br/><br/>Ralph, did you get to play this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
