These products did not meet my standards or their own promotional materials on a variety of fronts.  I hate shelling out my limited resources for what is frankly crap.  Yeah, I'm out triple-digit dollars on products I will never use, <i>Cest la vie</i>.  What I would like to discuss is the minimum standards that a game should meet before it is released.<br/><br/>What are your minimum expectations when you purchace a gaming product?  Also, what is the absolute minimum that should be done before releasing a game as "done?"<br/><br/>I expect any gaming product I pay for to facilitate the play experience they have advertised, even if that advertisement is simply the book's cover.<br/><br/>I expect any gaming product I pay for to have been Beta (outside) playtested, and that those playtests occurred prior to the finalization of the text.<br/><br/>Of dice, I expect that they will be at least nominally readable, and properly constructed.  Yeah, I got burned on dice, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111001/#Comment_111001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T20:16:12+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  8:16PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I expect the rules to work.

Often, games that suffer from this also suffer from a total (or near total) lack of examples. <br/><br/>If the game is advertised as providing a different play result than other games, it had better deliver. <br/><br/>I've run into several games that are heavy on gimmicky resolution mechanics (often ones that revolve around replacing dice with cards or some other form of randomizer) but otherwise provide <i>nothing</i> that dozens of existing generic game systems (such as GURPS or RISUS) can't also provide. These games are ultimately a waste of my time. <br/><br/>If you're charging me money for a game, make certain that it has been thoroughly tested. <br/><br/>I <i>loved</i> how a certain game got released as a commercial product first and <i>then</i> playtested after the fact (It is now available as a free download and has been tagged with the "beta" label. I paid $8.50 for the same incomplete game). On the up side, I only paid $8.50 for it. I could have been paying the $20 asking price for a recently released fantasy game that was played by only the designer and three other people in the six month run-up to publication.
