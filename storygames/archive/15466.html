I've worked with this challenge the last years, in relation to my classical fantasy game <i>Fabula</i>, but I have not yet told people what this "system" consist of, and how it works.<br/><br/>And I have not talked with other game-smiths or game-masters about how they meet this challenge. <br/><br/>How do you meet it?<br/><br/>Me?<br/>- I'm typically using a city-map and a world- or kingdom-map, plus a plan of a traditional house, to give players a sense of their home/city/land and to inform their dialogue. All these have important written info on them, and together they "paint a picture" of the physical world we play in. <br/><br/>On the same page is my use of a double-sided info-sheet, with core-information on popular songs and dances, traditional feasts, coins in use, inns and their menus, goods to be bought, and beasts of the wild. This info-sheet is actually the "GM-screen" of old, put on the table for all to use.<br/><br/>These maps/plans/sheets are put on the table, easy to reach and read for all. They are there to support the dialogue, by giving players on-hand setting-info. It helps players to use setting-relevant elements when talking in-character. It results in the player having a better feeling for the setting, and a far better feeling for the position of his character, both geographically and socially. <br/><br/>I find that in general this system of map/info-tools is very beneficent to the interaction in my classical role-playing game. It goes a long way to meet the challenge of bringing my unique setting to life in my game, even when handled by others.<br/><br/>So; <br/>- How do you, as a GM or game-smith, meet the challenge of communicating a unique setting to players?<br/>- Is there a "system" to how you do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350732/#Comment_350732" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T18:58:35+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  6:58PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally I find a list of names at hand that the GM and players can use to instantly conjure an NPC-handle helps a lot.  Otherwise you tend to get a lot of 'Bobs' or 'Thargs'<br/><br/>Geography, not so much.   I keep it vague (and flexible) and make it up as I go along, using mostly verbal descriptions or very crude scrawlings.  <br/><br/>Anyway, accurate maps that a significant proportion of the population are familliar with is a fairly recent thing. <i> If</i> youre playing a low-tech / low-education setting, why would the characters have any idea of where they are in relation to the rest of the world, other than '<i>city X is 3 days ride away through the forest, thataway..</i>", etc...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_350747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350747/#Comment_350747" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T00:43:02+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 12:43AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2011 12:48AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A sheet with lists of names is part of my system too. There are one list for each culture/race, and each list is divided by gender. THE most useful tool.<br/><br/>As for using maps in a low-tech world; I do. And I do see the paradox in it. Still: the maps represent the geographical knowledge of the world, that the characters have, and a map is the best way to manifest that. Placing such a map on the table, I often ask the players to regard it as something insubstantial in the character-world, so in dialogue they can only refer to it indirectly, not as a map. This is especially important when the characters are illiterate, which most characters in this fantasy world are (illiterate, and skeptical towards written things).<br/><br/>I draw all my maps myself, and I am always reflecting on how geo-centric they should be. At current I play the southern continent of my world in four campaigns, and the world map there is very good on the homelands of the map maker, and ridiculously faulty on the rest (depicting barbarians as three-headed demons, etc.). We are currently playing a part of it where the world map is totally useless to the players, other than to give some hints, create some fear, and of course; feed the dialogue with largely unfounded prejudices. ;-)<br/><br/>I love to play around with maps this way. <br/><br/>And I love to draw local maps that reflects some of the achievements of the player/characters. But that's me; I'm drawing maps like other people are knitting socks. Map-drawing is my knitting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350764/#Comment_350764" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T07:56:30+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  7:56AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas:<br/><br/>How much info does that sheet hold, and do you have multiple sheets with different info on them?<br/><br/>I've been considering doing something similar for historical based games to try to take some of the fear out of playing in such settings, but sometimes there seems to be way more info than could fit easily on one sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_350782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350782/#Comment_350782" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T10:47:34+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 10:47AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2011 10:47AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You have to organize the info carefully, and be very strict about what to put on the sheet, and what not to put there. and how much of each thing to put on it. There's all kinds of priorities to heed. I did 6-7 versions of my sheet before I found something close to what the game needed.<br/><br/>I'm going to make another sheet for the northern continent of my world, to highlight the special cultural and ecological differences. The same is true for some of the more exotic cultures of the southern continent. But it is a very time-consuming job to do, making these sheets, so I'm currently sticking to the one I got, and focusing my game-play (testing and designing) on the settings covered by the current sheet.<br/><br/>I believe such a sheet would be very useful in a historical setting. Such an easy game aid, to ensure everybodies enjoyment within the frames of plausible historica.<br/><br/>Go for it, Robert! It may be the key to unlock a truly interesting genre, that has, somehow, not been able to blossom in rpgs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_350878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350878/#Comment_350878" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T01:38:20+00:00" title="December  8, 2011  1:38AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2011 1:43AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>How much info does that sheet hold, and do you have multiple sheets with different info on them?</blockquote>I did not answer the first part of this question in my last post, so let me give you a clue by giving a list of content on page 1 of my sheet:<br/>- a table with 8 columns and 11 rows (including title-row)<br/>- 1.column: <b>Standard of Living</b>, named levels from -2 (shit) to +7 (dragon), coins on different levels.
