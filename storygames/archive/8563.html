A lot of them spend the night, so it's a bit different than what you're doing, which is more public, so caveat emptor. Here are some ideas and concerns.<br/><br/>Schedule games in reasonable blocks and leave ample time between for lunch and dinner. Realize that people don't like to get up early. Try noon to 5PM, 5PM-9PM, and 9PM-1AM (if you have night owls, 1 AM isn't bad, especially if your next game on the following day isn't till noon). That's three blocks a day, with one 5-hour block and two 4-hour blocks. <br/><br/>Schedule as much in advance as possible. For example, insist on advance registration. Determine GMs in advance, and slot them immediately. Make players sign up for games before the con. Really. Don't create new slots for GMs until you fill up existing games (people can always shift around). I've had a lot of heartache at my house con over this. Look at the threads here for Ice Station Nerdly, JHosmer's annual house con. He does scheduling right, and I'm going to follow his lead from now on. If you just let people sign up when you get there, you'll have GMs canceling on you at the last minute because they want to play in someone else's game, and games getting canceled because they don't have enough players, and a host of other scheduling problems. You'll be strong-arming people to run games, or running games yourself, and you'll be stressed out instead of having fun.<br/><br/>So before the day of the con, you know 1) who is running what and when, 2) who is playing in those games, 3) how many tables and chairs you need for each slot. This lets you make arrangements with the community center in advance. No reason to rent rooms or equipment you don't need.<br/><br/>Is anyone selling anything there? Be sure to understand business licensing requirements. Make sure the community center doesn't have any prohibitions against commerce (or anything else, really). <br/><br/>Separate the social space from the gaming space, if possible. Even if it's "just chat on the other side of the room." Keeps the noise down. Separate gaming tables from one another as much as possible for the same reason. Put the food in the social area. People like to chat and eat. Make sure you have ample garbage cans and trash bags. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Start an email list or something to manage this. The easier it is for people to use, the better, but you'll want an open communication channel between you and your attendees. Ice Station Nerdly used a thread here to organize the con and it worked great because we're all Story Game folks. I've used a wiki and email to organize mine, but few people bothered to update their own stuff. I had to collect info and do the updates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189725/#Comment_189725" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T08:54:40+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  8:54AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2009 8:56AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please tell us more about what you had in mind, maybe answer Graham's questions, and we can give more focused advice.  <br/><br/>Let's start a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=How_To_Set_Up_A_Story_Gaming_Event" rel="nofollow">minicon HOWTO</a> over in the Story Games Codex, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan" title="MountZionRyan"><img alt="MountZionRyan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/426/nG1TIXTID71FS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan">MountZionRyan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189727/#Comment_189727" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T09:28:26+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  9:28AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Please tell us more about what you had in mind, maybe answer Graham's questions, and we can give more focused advice.<br/></blockquote>\nWill Do.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/>There you go.

It's a smallish convention, about 50 people, in a community centre. Sessions are: 10am to 1pm, 2pm to 6pm, 7pm to 10pm.<br/><br/>1. Arrive at 9am-ish.<br/>2. Pay five pounds on the door and get a namebadge (note the price: charging five pounds means you don't need to worry about change).<br/>3. If you want to run a game, put out a sign-up sheet.<br/>4. People sign up for games.<br/>5. Some games sign up, some don't, some are half-full and need to be combined with others.<br/>6. You go out to buy lunch and dinner. This is good. Gets you out of the hall.<br/>7. Repeat steps 3-5 one hour before the other slots start.<br/><br/>Here's how SteveCon does it. It's an even smaller convention, in a room above a pub, with 20 people. Sessions are 1pm to about 5pm, then maybe another one in the evening.<br/><br/>1. Arrive. Get a pint.<br/>2. When everyone's there, we sit in a big circle. Steve asks the person who's travelled the furthest what they'd like to play. From there, there's a process of working out what people want to run and what people want to play. Groups are formed.<br/>3. At some point, you ask Steve whether he'd like any money. He says yes, in which case you give him money, or no, in which case you buy him a Coke.<br/>4. Repeat step 2 for the second session of the day.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189731/#Comment_189731" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T10:06:16+00:00" title="January 23, 2009 10:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pre-registration is a headache and also means that the more hardcore folks take all the good spots and/or only sign up for games with each other.

Everybody who has weighed in so far is right.  <br/><br/>I've organized a few events of this type and here's my take:<br/><br/>1.  Minimize your own work by simplifying and delegating.  <br/>2.  Maximize everyone's fun by carefully planning things that reward planning and leaving everything else alone.<br/>3.  Anticipate chaos and delegate someone to deal with it.<br/><br/>For 20 person gatherings, assuming everybody is there for more or less the same sort of experience, hashing out what to play on the spot isn't a problem.  I tell everyone to come prepared to run a game and that helps.  Having hard and fast schedule times is helpful to everybody, so you can set those in stone and enforce them to a point.<br/><br/>If you have a three hour session, that's a good length for lots of things - board and card games always, prepped sessions of some games, demos, that sort of thing.

The location I have in mind is actually a little north of Knoxville and is not set in stone.  It is a great place, two big conference rooms, a kitchen, a gym, but might be a little out of the way for some.

I had a tough time making sure that there were enough GMs for the three groups of 4-5 players, and I know that Jeffrey Hosmer doesn't have that problem because he pre-schedules everyone in a forum thread.<br/><br/>With a larger group and with more of those folks prepared to run something, flying by the seat of your pants might work fine.
