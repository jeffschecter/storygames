I'm new around here. I've been lurking for a bit, but one comment I read here intrigued me enough to register. It was <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2780#Item_13" rel="nofollow">this one by eruditus</a>.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">c) I can't say much about the "coolness" of D&amp;D.; All snarkiness aside I think the fun came out of imagination and the fact that we were 12 (or in my case 8). I recently played a D&amp;D; dungeon crawl and to be honest once I put myself into the mental framework of "okay, I'm 15 again" it really was a lot of fun. But it was a social fun. A little puzzle solving. A little role-playing. A little number crunching. A lot of soda, chips and side comments about relations between giants and hobbits. 15 again.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThat seems like <i>exactly</i> what I'd consider a fun &amp; wildly successful RPG session. Social fun. A little puzzle solving. A little role-playing. A little number crunching. Snacks &amp; side comments. That's what I'm going for. Even if I'm 38 &amp; not 15. I don't have to try to summon up my teenage mindset to enjoy that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, there are lots of things about how I played the game when I was a teenager that don't appeal to me anymore. Too much rules lawyering. Too much emphasis on detailed simulation. Too much complaining about what's wrong with the rules &amp; trying to fix them rather than really trying to understand why the author didn't think they were broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure I can come up with more, but all the things that eruditus listed are things I still want. Maybe even more now then when I was a teenager.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leaves me wondering what it is eruditus wants from an RPG when he isn't taking on a teenage mindset.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I want to read everyone else's thoughts as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr.%20Sluagh" title="Mr. Sluagh"><img alt="Mr. Sluagh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr.%20Sluagh">Mr. Sluagh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81798/#Comment_81798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T14:17:39+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  2:17PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2007 2:18PM by Mr. Sluagh.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read it, but isn't this what OctaNe is supposed to do, more or less?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian" title="Malthusian"><img alt="Malthusian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian">Malthusian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81803/#Comment_81803" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T14:25:27+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  2:25PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I began playing the D&amp;D; basic set when I was about ten years old (1982). It was the first I'd ever heard of RPGs. And, to be honest, I find it to be a defining contributor to who I am today. Back then my friends and I played for the sheer joy of being someone else in a world that wasn't reality. We rarely concerned ourselves with the mechanics of the game, using them mostly only during combat; everything else was fairly freeform. We learned to play without dice, since bullies tended to take those away (as did teachers).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun, escapist gaming. The fond memories of those days is what brought me to Story Games, looking for more narrative control, less number-crunching, and a chance to feel like a kid again.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Michael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
