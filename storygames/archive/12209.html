RT is a near future set game, solidly inspired by fictional works by Gibson and films like Blade Runner, and very far from any geek-infested popular culture implementation of the concept of "cyberpunk". All good science fiction, and indeed literature, is about what it means being human, and so is RT. I am partial to this, shall we say, genre, and a while ago I adapted Ron Edward's Trollbabe to run Blade Runner-inspired games with the hack "Tears in Rain". Therefore it's good to see that Gregor quotes Trollbabe among the influences for RT.<br/><br/>RT is a game design built to facilitate Story Now - there's no GM, and all characters, be it player characters or supporting characters/organisations ("factions") may shift between the players if they want to. You can keep your "own" character close to you, as in more traditional games, but the way new characters and stories are constantly emerging, I can't see why you necessarily would.<br/><br/>We played for about three hours, and managed to create both a complex fictional setting as well as interesting story lines. In RT every players gets to set a scene one at a time. We got through 12 scenes in that time, and here are the notes (thanks to Gregor):<br/><br/>Player Characters<br/><br/>ZATUMO RYU-YEN, Operative (created and initially played by Gregor)<br/>Ready: 4 (was 2 to start)<br/>Willing: 5<br/>Able: 5<br/>POSITIVE<br/>Angry (at bodyguard)<br/>Armed (with Nagant revolver)<br/>Supported<br/>NEGATIVE<br/>Humiliated (by Fliss' brother)<br/>Lost (short-term memory gone)<br/>MOTIVATION<br/>Greed<br/>GOAL<br/>Get rich beyond his wildest dreams (W ticked)<br/>NOTES<br/>Zeiss Artificial Optics<br/>Bodyguard (now dead)<br/>AIWA Personality Chip (boosts his Willing)<br/><br/>ALEX BRABHAM, PhotoJournalist, Insider, works for Press Agency (created and initially played by Malcolm)<br/>Ready: 5 (was 4 to start)<br/>Willing: 5<br/>Able: 5 (was 3 to start)<br/>POSITIVE<br/>Financed (by Archibald Leach Press Agency)<br/>(was Convinced: Allied Carbide up to something, but has used it up)<br/>NEGATIVE<br/>Coerced (by Allied Carbide<br/>(was Burned Out: by the job, but has removed that Condition)<br/>MOTIVATION<br/>Knowledge<br/>GOAL<br/>Why the village by the Allied Carbide factory in Chiapas died in the night<br/>NOTES<br/>Leica camera and lenses<br/>House in Liverpool<br/>Telefunken Tablet<br/><br/>REIF JONZ, Insider (created and initially played by Per)<br/>Ready: 5<br/>Willing: 4<br/>Able: 3<br/>POSITIVE<br/>Connected (lawyer)<br/>Financed (raise)<br/>NEGATIVE<br/>(was Trapped: by the job, but has removed that Condition)<br/>MOTIVATION<br/>Freedom<br/>GOAL<br/>Become a board member of Orange Micro (A ticked)<br/>NOTES<br/>Pontiac Keypad Uplink<br/>Heinkel Taser<br/>Pan Am Doll<br/>Separated from his wife, but still pays the mortgage.

You, as the player, decides where. How many successes you get matters if your desired outcome of the fiction is directly opposed to someone else, and it interlinks with the game system's many moving parts where you can buy-off conditions, reach characters goal etc. You also buy outcomes in the fiction with your successes.<br/><br/>GM responsibilities within the game are still there, of course, and in RT you are the Controller of the scene you set when it's your turn - ie. you have the main GMing responsibilities of framing the scene, deciding what kind of scene it is etc. Everyone around the table is encouraged to chip in with details, colour and so on. If a non-Controller plays one of the factions or characters from the pool and wins a conflict in the scene he gets an "Edge Die", which basically gives you a free extra die on a future roll (thus it follows the players who earned it).<br/><br/>EDIT to add the scenes we got through:<br/>SCENES<br/>1 (G) Intro: Zatumo. Zatumo kills bodyguard<br/>2 (M) Intro: Brabham on train, looking at glossy, high-end magazine containing some of his photgraphy (it s established that print magazines like this are rare and expensive, a symbol of status when most people simply look at magazines on their tablets)<br/>3 (P) Intro: Reif calls Yasmin, with whom he has been having an affair<br/><br/>4 Intro: Allied Carbide flies Dr Taylor into Chiapas in order to try and spin the situation to their advantage.<br/>5 Intro: Menwith-Fylingdale buys Laywer firm and thus establishes some kind of presence on Earth.<br/>6 Intro: Templar Sec investigates murder of bodyguard<br/><br/>7 Face/Off: Menwith vs Raif over merger/redundancy (Cross into next scene)<br/>8 Intro/PC: Jari (with a Cross of Riif's promotion)<br/>9 Intro/Faction: Sue Kova?

Anyway, I was curious to see how you viewed her as it was you who introduced her. Could you talk a little about the process of how you created her? Did you want to create a Faction and then the choices on the lists threw up Kovac to you? Or did you have an idea and then the lists formalised that into Kovac?<br/><br/><sub>Oh, and <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81526" rel="nofollow">Remember Tomorrow</a> is now on OBS.</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274822/#Comment_274822" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T05:57:35+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  5:57AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I wanted to try having a single character as a faction - because it was possible <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I think that worked really well, but I did later almost regret that she wasn't a pooled PC, because she grew quite interesting and I wanted to play her as a held PC!<br/><br/>I did use the faction list in the book as an inspiration to create Kovac - I think what really made her interesting was when I chose the negative condition "Coerced" - in fact she ended up being quite different from what initially had in mind, which was a professional, effective freelance investigator for Templar Sec.<br/><br/>I very much like the lists, but also that you don't have to use them.

Fliss had been singularly unsuccessful in getting that Goal. So, this time I decided I would play Zatumo.<br/><br/>I framed the drunken and odious Zatumo in a hotel/casino bar and had him pick up a girl to take back to his room. He was in the bathroom showering while his bodyguard was in the bedroom with the girl. I then had the girl's boyfriend come in with a handgun and threaten to shoot the shit out of everyone. I rolled the dice. Zatumo was pretty successful: I got 2 success but on Ready and Able. Not Willing. (On an Intro scene you set it yourself, roll unopposed and narrate.)<br/><br/>Not Willing. Huh.<br/><br/>So, Zatumo grabs a straight razor from his shaving kit in the bathroom and threatens to come out and chop everyone up, gun or no gun. But he doesn't do it. Not Willing, right? The dude with the gun and the girl leave and my bodyguard just tries not to be involved. When the couple are gone Zatumo comes out in a rage (I choose "Angry: with my bodyguard" as a Positive Condition) and he is now more Ready to take on the world (so I give him +1 Ready too) and he storms out and chops up his own bodyguard (NPCs like this can just be killed in narration). I then grabbed the gun off him (to fit up with my existing Armed PCon), got dressed and headed off through the hotel into the night, pissed as hell.<br/><br/>Grim guy, but hey he's a PC. His Goal is to be "Rich beyond his wildest dreams". There was also a lot of stuff open to interpretation there. Who was the girl? Was that really her boyfriend? What about my now dead bodyguard? What was I out celebrating at the Casino and so on.<br/><br/>Flash round a few turns and we're making Factions and Introducing them. On Per's turn he introduces Templar Sec (a sort of privatized Interpol) at the crime scene at the hotel. Bang! Per has the Templar Cops find the girl and put her in protective custody, and they try to get on the trail of Zatumo. They get pretty successful and Per loads them up with Conditions.<br/><br/>And you can see this lead on to people naturally having the tools to go after Zatumo in Face-Offs, and an incentive to do so too (they get Edge dice if they're successful using a Faction or pooled PC). Malc also introduced a pooled PC Jari who is the bodyguard's father who wants revenge on his killer. And Per intro'd Kovac too, linked to that storyline.<br/><br/>So, you can see the Zatumo storyline there. But what's fun for me is that I can also clearly see the Alex Brabham storyline in there too. And Reif Jonz' story is weaving in and out as well. Jari has read about him in the news (on a cross). We know they are going to be crashing into each other soon.<br/><br/>Per, I think you should make Kovac a PC in a future episode. I mean, Zatumo is an NPC of the Crocus Brood Faction in the rulebook, right?<br/><br/>When you get Joint Winners with mixed Scene Goals (like Alex Brabham had with Allied Carbide) it throws up interesting outcomes. With simply directly opposed Scene Goals the outcome wouldn't have been as rich.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274868/#Comment_274868" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T12:27:47+00:00" title="June  7, 2010 12:27PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ready, Willing, and Able sounds pretty cool!

Zatumo could have chopped everyone up if I'd wanted to. On the Intro scene I'm the narrator and NPC created on the fly are at the mercy of that. But the lack of Willingness was something I should colour the fiction with.<br/><br/>You each hold one PC in your hand,everything else sits in the middle of the table and is shared. So, the Factions are sitting there with deals and NPCs written on them, and shared PCs are there with notes on them too. And your own held PC has some text scribbled next to any conditions they have and you'd write in any deals you'd made.<br/><br/>I'm not sure the game orders them. Well, on your turn you pick what interests you most as Controller, and sometimes it's mandated that there must be a cross from a previous scene (on a rolled double) or a really strong cross (for a triple or better on someone's dice roll). What really strong means is left up to the group's taste to decide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274873/#Comment_274873" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T12:52:07+00:00" title="June  7, 2010 12:52PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2010 12:52PM by Per_Fischer.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, let's wait for Gregor himself to answer your question about Ready, Willing, and Able - after just one session I'm not entirely sure how they work precisely and how much fictional leeway you have after the roll.

Those would be good to hear.<br/><br/>Um, the partial lists on the bigger character sheet were just so that you don't have to refer to the book when making up gear on the fly. If they're confusing I can drop them from an expanded sheet. (They don't appear on the basic sheets in the book.) If they're more of a hindrance than a help that would be good to know.<br/><br/>I think there's a "jump" for players to not see their turn as Controller as their turn as a player of their character. I also think that the other players need to see how you want to play your PC and work with that when framing scenes for them. My hope is that the Intro scene kicks out there enough stuff about your character and what they're shooting for. So when framing a scene they need to give you room to breathe before hitting the hammer on you, if that makes sense?<br/><br/>If a scene doesn't work or it's too jarring then you can always just call it a colour scene where each person picks one outcome. The example of a colour scene in the book was from when Russ framed Malcolm's antiquarian book dealer into a potentially dangerous scene with the taser-firing Crocus Brood. It worked for Russ but not for Malcolm. I mean Malc had a strong view of Miriam and just couldn't see her hanging around the bad part of town Russ had framed her into. So Malc got her out of there as soon as he could. Russ didn't think the Crocus Brood gave a rat's ass about Miriam and wouldn't fight her truning tail, so he just called it a colour scene. It could have gone another way, though, Malc could have had Miriam confront them (I think she was pretty boosted with good Parameters and PCons) and she'd have had a good chance of at least being a Joint Winner with the Brood.<br/><br/>Thanks, Jason! I know the brands are "only" words but they do colour my view of the gear more than I had thought they would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275543/#Comment_275543" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T09:56:34+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  9:56AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The big checklist on the expanded sheet - we just ignored it.  The names and stuff were neat for colour, for sure (and we ended up with a lot of strange, cool branded gear like President's Choice No-Name Brand Amphetamine Pills and a 3-Piece Samsung 20% Kevlar Suit) but the real-estate on the sheet didn't seem justified.  What did a check-mark next to "Pontiac" even mean? <br/><br/>It's hard not to see your held PC as "your" character when your turn as controller comes around.  I think maybe a change in the way handling works might help that.  Also, after six intro scenes, we started to feel a little like we were telling each other stories rather than roleplaying - it didn't make sense to jump into PC-on-PC confrontations right away and so we ended up doing a couple of deals first.  Which felt like more solo-play.  When your turn as controller came around, it felt strange because you couldn't initiate conflict between your PC and a faction.  For example, the PC I created was Arbalest, a rogue AI who was forced into a human body by some hackers.  His goal was to "get revenge on the hackers that did this to me" but as Controller, I wasn't mechanically able to pursue that goal.  The hackers were there - they were an active Faction - but I couldn't get at them unless someone else attacked Arbalest with them.  It made me want to Intro a PC just so I could give Arbalest up so that someone else could take him so that I could attack him with the Hackers.  It felt really convoluted.    <br/><br/>Something else that we found a little difficult was the introducing of new NPCs.  We'd run an Intro scene or a Deal scene about a particular Faction and describe a particular NPC or two.  Following the scene, it felt a lot like one of those NPCs should have been upgraded to a PC, but nobody wanted to run another Intro to bring them in.  It sort of felt like there should have been an option, maybe during a Deal scene, where you could run an intro and split off a PC from a faction.<br/><br/>Just some feedback - there were parts of the game that really worked for me, too, but these were the sticking points we had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275574/#Comment_275574" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T11:16:17+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 11:16AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!<br/><br/>I'll throw up some sheets without the lists and have boxes for "Brand", "Type" and "Detail", like "Pan-Am | Tank | Called "Gloria" with 125-mm gun and smoke launchers".<br/><br/>The mental leap to make, and it's a tough one, is to really feel like your PC when you're not Controller. Get someone else to frame scenes for you and ask to be in scenes that you're not immediately framed into. For example, you could well be in the Penny Black Bar when the Crocus Brood start picking a fight with Fliss.<br/><br/>When it's your turn as Controller look to other PCs that could getting a Face-Off, then consider if your PC could or would be the one doing it. I don't know if that helps? For you to get playing your PCs "like PCs" you need to get framing for each other.<br/><br/>NPCs with personality emerging from Factions are awesome for me. It makes it easier for me to visualize their badness and tempting deals. But I remember they're a face of that Faction. They've got the Faction's mechanics to back them up and they're a bit like a Pooled PC in that anyone can play them. Of course, they can't be held, but it also means that they can't be targeted. And if they get INF:8 they get written out Triumphant.<br/><br/>I see Armitage in Neuromancer as an NPC of Wintermute, who is a Faction that gets INF:8 in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275575/#Comment_275575" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T11:17:13+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 11:17AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and when you frame scenes let the PC "breathe" and get played a little (at least) before you bring the hammer down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275578/#Comment_275578" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T11:29:36+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 11:29AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did I misinterpret the rules that said that a controller can just off an NPC whenever they like?  We say promotion of a character from NPC to PC as a sort of insurance that they'd play their own unique part of the story.  We wanted face-offs between our PC and the NPCs of particular factions and we wanted to be the ones instigating them.  The NPCs have the face of the faction but they're very fragile.  What if a Controller playing Wintermute had just decided "eh, fuck it, it'll be cool if Armitage dies in this scene" - would it have to be a non-mechanical discussion (to the point of Calling Bullshit, even) outside of the fiction about whether it's okay to kill Armitage or not?      <br/><br/>I think maybe we were unclear on the "goal" of the game.  I mean, if the idea is to advance the Goal of your PC, you need to have face-offs to do that.  To get Face-Off scenes you need to go up against other PCs because you can't choose to face-off against a Faction of your own accord.  I felt, personally, like it was a little difficult to grok what I was supposed to be doing, above and beyond "tell a rad cyberpunk story".  <br/><br/>I think that the Cross mechanic did a good job of forcing us to keep our characters tied together but I think maybe that more mechanical impetus needed to be there during the first round of character creation.  Enforcing, maybe, that all of the initial characters have a Cross by default and then that everyone creates a Faction and Crosses in at least one or two characters in their introduction.  We were doing some of that stuff ourselves, but we didn't have to.  There wasn't a lot of guidance in the game to do it.<br/><br/>(Again, I feel like I'm focusing a lot on the parts we had trouble with - I'll say this, I loved the PCons and NCons and how they worked and the die mechanic was really encouraging to narration - knowing whether a character was Ready, Willing or Able really helped me play out framed scenes.  Oh, a quick question, though.

I totally get what you mean. And I appreciate the feedback. (I'm superpleased you had fun with it on the first run out.)<br/><br/>By the way, Wintermute does kill off Armitage at the end of Neuromancer! (But I reckon that Armitage's death is sealed because it's an Exit.)<br/><br/>If you want to go up against a particular NPC -- like you have a real beef with them and you want them "protected" from someone at the table just killing them off -- then make them part of your Goal. If you have no ticks in your current Goal you're not losing anything by changing the wording or Goal. Fliss always wants to kill Zatumo, but I've never got there yet in game.<br/><br/>NPCs can be killed (or apparently killed) at the will of the narrator (which may or may not be the Controller), but not if their demise is tied to a Goal. (And by the way they can also be cryo-fixed, cloned or otherwise brought back if it makes sense in the fiction and they haven't been exited by a successful Goal.)<br/><br/>For me PCs can be really far apart to start, but when I make a Faction I like to make them an enemy (in my mind) for at least one PC and pregnant with the possibility for more. With common enemy Factions, cut Deals and surprising crosses on dice rolls the stories move closer to each other. For a punchier story I agree that you want to link everyone from the get go.<br/><br/>Mechanics-wise: When you spend Outcomes you can buy up anything, not just what you rolled successes on. So if being Willing now helped you become more Ready for later then that's all good.<br/><br/>Oh, and on a roll when you burn off a PCon in exchange for a Success: It's just a Success because of the PCon, rather than being allocated to a Parameter. You might also roll 3 Successes on Parameters and get 4 Successes in the end (as good as a PC can do: Ready, Willing and Able and Angry too, say). A Faction can get a maximum of 5, which is 4 dice rolled on INF and a PCon burnt. It means that to tick a Goal box on a low Parameter you've still got to roll low and allocate it to that Parameter, rather than just buying the Goal tick with a PCon. So buy up those low ranked Parameters...<br/><br/>The three Exits might well be a PC demise (Injured, Dying, then Dead), a Faction triumphing and one PC getting their Goal. I don't see everyone getting their Goal in one episode or some PCs even getting close.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275594/#Comment_275594" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T12:16:05+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 12:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I should say Fliss does kill Zatumo in an example, but that was me making that up.

A pretty significant departure from the first time I played 3:16, for example, but fun, still.  Though, there are some definite design elements present in both games.  You sure love your random fiction tables, huh?  ;-)<br/><br/>I get the Goal-protection clause for NPCs - I write "Kill Nakata Stamos" as my goal and you sure as shit can't just off Mr. Stamos in a scene.  That much makes sense.  I guess the issue here was less about protection and more about skipping unnecessarily long Introduction periods.  Like I said, if I introduce Manager Honda during a Deal Scene with the Nakagawa Coprosperity Agency it feels like a huge burden to wait a whole cycle of turns just so I can play his Introduction scene and make him a full PC.  If I want Manager Honda to have his own Goals and Motivations and such, I'm meant to have to wait out that whole cycle, which breaks up the fiction.  I think I'd probably consider working in an optional rule about splitting off PCs if another roll serves as their Introduction.<br/><br/>I could see the game taking on quite a life of its own.  As we played, we were generating PCs and Factions in the background - a shadowy military figure, some unnamed man we all had a connection to, etc.  It was neat - at any time we were ready to bring those whispered-about characters into the limelight, we could write them up and take our turn as an Introduction.  Those were the kinds of Intro scenes we _wanted_ rather than feeling forced to play out a scene to Intro someone we already know. <br/><br/>There's still a little bit of tricky business in the whole issue with holding your PC and just sort of asking people to antagonize them in particular ways, but I guess if you wrote really clear Goals you could just trust the other players to use the Factions to bash you around and move you towards those goals.<br/><br/>We'll have to play it again, I think, before I can get a really firm idea of what I really think.  This is all initial stuff.  I'll play it again at GPNW and see what happens!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275618/#Comment_275618" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T14:42:31+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  2:42PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2010 2:42PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience from other "your turn to frame scene" games is that if there is a clear place for people to look for ideas and constraints when it's their turn to frame scenes, it helps them enormously.

After two scenes of my PC I realized his story was mostly tangental, and if we had kept going (past the 4-hour mark I think), I'd have put him up on the shelf and concentrated on Daniel's character.<br/><br/>Looking back, I think we should have set up an initial situation, not an initial theme, and made sure every scene played to that situation, and that double-crosses etc continued the story from the previous scene directly. Like, make them more connected than we did.<br/><br/>I felt the same as Adam, that Intros should be sub-scenes, and that a dude who is introduced could just be written up as a character or faction on the spot, regardless of what kind of scene was happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus"><img alt="Linnaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.rushcomm.ca/~gcam/Guernica Bull.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278021/#Comment_278021" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T08:47:40+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  8:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, Johnstone, et al<br/><br/>If you haven't before, I would strongly suggest you read some of Gibson's later work, especially All Tomorrow's Parties and Spook Country.

Thanks Adam and Johnstone.<br/><br/>I guess I do Intros and Deals pretty quick when I'm playing; just a swift set-up and then make with the dice quick. I pick the Outcomes (or cry when there's none!) and flip them into the fiction. Then we roll on to the next dude as Controller. That sounds like what you were doing and I'm super happy that you had fun with it.<br/><br/>I totally dug the Controller framing everyone into an area and then the Faction carpet bombing it. Super strong! In those sort of situations it's even more super-awesome when everyone's a winner too. You get the "Oh no! I just got Scene Goaled -- Carpet Bombing, oh noes! ... But, wait a minute I just got superloads of Outcomes and my own Scene Goal too -- and since I'm not a Loser no one can dog anything more on me! Woohoo!"<br/><br/>Big Bad Factions are cool too. Especially when you bring them back and they're just set back to INF: 4 (or 5 if they got really out of hand an triumphed). It means you can at least get a shot in at the fuckers in your next Episode.<br/><br/>I think there is a learning curve to it even though it's a short book and a quick read. It probably takes at bit of play and reflection to get up to speed. I mean, when you start spending Outcomes on Losers to help them out that's when it gets hot. (NAFTA and Molly are joint winners, Johnny is a Loser. Molly and Johnny get Dying as a NAFTA's Scene Goal. Molly gets W:Goal tick as her Scene Goal. Johnny burns a PCon anyway, since he's a loser to get a tick on A:Goal since he didn't get it as a Scene Goal. The Outcomes? They almost all get spent on Johnny, if you see what I mean. Molly giving him PCons and <i>taking</i> a +1 to Willing while NAFTA load him up with NCons and -1 to Able.)<br/><br/>Seth, thanks! Fantastico!<br/><br/><sub>Edit: to add my missing word! Molly is the one grabbing a +1 to Willing. She can't help out Johnny that way.</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn" title="Murgh_Bpurn"><img alt="Murgh_Bpurn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn">Murgh_Bpurn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279381/#Comment_279381" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T23:48:21+00:00" title="July  5, 2010 11:48PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just bought this game and I'm really liking it, can't wait to give it a spin!

Our very first scene was a face-off between The Teeth, a street gang beholden to some unknown organization, and one of the players, who was a totally bound and bought-in delivery driver for Omoto. (The corp charges its employees ruthlessly for training and lost materials, so they sometimes wind up basically indentured to work while they pay off the debts, and so on.) The gang boxed her into a dead-end street in an attempt to jack a load of pharmaceuticals, and we roll. The Teeth roll no successes, the driver rolls three. She gasses the gang out cold, takes their shoes and their guns, bumps up a couple of Parameters and grabs the PCon: Armed. Nice.<br/><br/>My question is, since she got three unopposed successes in a face-off scene, one in each of R|W|A, it seems like she could have just gone tick, tick, tick, and bought off her Goal to get out from under the thumb of the corporation, right then and there. Is that correct? I mean, it's kind of neat that a held PC can ascend on the first turn of the game - and nicer that she chose not to - but is that intentional, or did we read the rules incorrectly?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285140/#Comment_285140" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T08:17:54+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  8:17AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I understand the rules, there's a limit of one tick per character per Scene (and the same for unticking a ticked Goal).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285142/#Comment_285142" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T08:20:53+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  8:20AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, see p.18 (although the example is muddy, the text is clear.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285242/#Comment_285242" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T11:43:01+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 11:43AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yes, of course it does.

We played another game of RT here last night with four players, three of whom had not played before, and two of those were total non-gamers (they were improvisers, though, so were good with setting up and playing out scenes). The game was super fun again - we had a little trouble, as mentioned above, tying together the held PCs initially, but things eventually built up around one or two central PCs/factions, and things ended with a satisfying bang. They'll be coming back...<br/><br/>The question is: in two-sided face-off scenes, it felt like we were getting a lot of ties. Like, half of the face-offs that we set up ended with just two co-winners, and no losers, so no margin of success to spend on outcomes, and no super satisfying resolution of scene goals. I mean, we worked it so that both winners got what they wanted, which lead to some pretty entertaining double-screwage at times, but it still felt like those scenes didn't really move anything forward, both fictionally, and in the sense of advancing the PCs or factions involved.

Where everyone is a Joint Winner you get all your successes as Outcomes (as the nearest Loser is 0).<br/>(3) Apart from your Scene Goal you can't affect the other "side" with Negative Conditions, as they're not Losers. It sometimes makes you wish you'd picked an NCon or Goal Untick as a Scene Goal...<br/><br/>A tie of 3 or 4 successes means Scene Goals all round and a stacking of PCons, usually a Goal tick and Parameter boosts. Suddenly a tie is much better than a narrow win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286119/#Comment_286119" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T11:19:56+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 11:19AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>(2) Your Margin is the number of successes more than the nearest Loser.

I'm buying NCons Injured and possibly Confused on you (I like to tag folks with Confused; it leads to all sorts of pain callable later). You probably buy the PCon Loved, maybe Supported. Neither of us is a Loser, so no one can burn NCons on the other to lower the Margin of Success.

It's ambiguous whether opposed Scene Goals cause a guaranteed Winner/Loser split rather than Joint Winners, only one of which gets their Goal. For myself, I'm more inclined to run things so its a required Loser which opens options when it happens and encourages people <em>not</em> to have directly opposed Scene Goals (because, frankly, they're boring).</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296229/#Comment_296229" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T04:51:53+00:00" title="October  8, 2010  4:51AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Alexander, just a slight correction: The Winners don't buy Injured and Loved, they get them for free as their Scene Goals. The MOS gets spent on good things that come out of facing up to a challenge and winning (and the greater number of successes your opponent rolled showed how tough a challenge it was to match).<br/><br/>In the case of Opposed Goals and Joint Winners, then the Scene Goal goes to whoever rolled the highest success. If it's tied all the way down (and you might be talking 1 success each and you both rolled a 6) then no one gets the Scene Goal.<br/><br/>Compromise is for before you get to the roll and you want to get out of it without rolling dice (i.e. making it a Colour Scene). Once the dice hit the table there will be Scene Goals and Outcomes coming. There is no room for compromise then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12209/remember-tomorrow-somewhere" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12209/remember-tomorrow-somewhere" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12209/remember-tomorrow-somewhere/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12209%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12209%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
