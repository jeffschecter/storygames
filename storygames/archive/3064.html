I think there might be a few reasons for it, I dunno though:<br/><br/>* could it be because popular media, like TV, movies and comic books, always portray the hero(es) as young, in their 20s and early 30s?<br/>* could it be because people don't know what it feels like to play an older person, so it subconsciously gets stricken from the palate when designing a character in an "all age levels are treated mechanically equally" game?<br/>* could it be simple ageism? We can't see older people as kung fu hacker badasses, and can't think of anything comperably awesome that they Could do as an older character?<br/>* older people tend to have families (which restrict an "adventurer character") and tend not to have wild romances and the like?<br/><br/>Also, that last rhetorical point brings a further question:<br/><br/>What are "awesome things" that older characters could do that younger characters can't? <br/>A few thoughts:<br/>-- Have far more people connections, and mechanical support to make them hugely influential (grew up with the mayor, know the corp exec's sister from college, etc)<br/>-- Far more general knowledge "skill points".<br/><br/>Yeah, thinking back to all my gaming, I've only remembered two older characters played. One was JMstar's viking old crone from Art Grace Guts, and my best friend's bard character, who was in his 60s or so at the beginning of play (no mechanical effects).  That's out of like 20 years of gaming.

Which is even more obvious in D&amp;D or the like: "Why is my grizzled old general who fought in a dozen wars only third level?"  <br/><br/>This breaks down as soon as you think about it (experience has very little to do with a character's experience and more to do with a character's importance to the story/player reward cycles/etc).

Older characters have luxuries of wisdom and resources that younger characters don't. In modern society we're both culturally oblivious to that value and materially exploitive of it. But in a game where the value is made mechanically indisputable, then I'd like to see the society acknowledging of it. Wisdom and mentorship should be significant. Age, as reflected in the setting, should have dignity. Older characters should be active culturally. And if antagonists, older characters should be dangerous for their strengths, not for their creepiness or their relentlessness.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70169/#Comment_70169" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T09:19:04+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:19AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a post in the May things to watch about using SOTC to play Trav.

Old Folks are not who Hero's Stories are about.  They have come through their story.  They are the sages, the oracles, the Mad Blind Men.  At the end of Oedipus Rex we find him slashing his eyes out, he has completed his journey.  In the future episodes we find him not in the role of the protagonist, but instead in the more traditional role of foreteller. (my recollection of Oedipus at Colous is less complete, but this is his role in Antigone)<br/><br/>There is perhaps nothing that says this transformation must occur while we are young.  It could perhaps be claimed that the lack of transformation is what makes us \xe2\u20ac\u0153young.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  The mechanical benefits of being \xe2\u20ac\u0153old\xe2\u20ac\x9d are some of the things that are the by product of this transformation.  The contacts, the experience, the knowledge.  For me, playing through the accumulation of these rewards is what makes up the Hero\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Story.  <br/><br/>It could be argued that Old Folks don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t accumulate experience.  Not in a real world sense, but in a Narrative sense.  They have transformed into who they are.  Their journey is complete.  Of course this conceit is untrue, but it is perhaps the basis for an overwhelming amount of Literature.<br/><br/>All that being said, a game could be made of the experience of the Old Folk.  This is not a game where your hero transforms, but is one that guides the transformation of the next generation of heroes.  How far will you be willing to go to teach your charge the life lessons he must learn.  Will you put the needs of the community first?   How will you affect the life transforming events upon your charge?  With compassion, dignity, pettiness, harshness?   Have you chosen the right charge?  Was this decision made for you?  What are the tests you will conceive to prove your Hero?  Are there others vying to prove their Hero\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Destiny.  What manipulations are you willing to commit to give your Hero his place in Destiny?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70180/#Comment_70180" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T09:32:06+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:32AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #FF0000;">Trust me, as I get older, I realize that older people in the real world often don't know more about the (real world) setting than anyone else.

It think it starts as a sort of niche protection, as the age almost always makes a guy stand out.  Recently, my first <i>FLFS</i> character was the hardened ship's captain who became a trope on Bill Adama after I started developing him.  And my brand new <i>Fading Suns</i> character is in his fifties, running around with all of these late-twennisummings.  Historically, my favorite Cyberpunk character was a 'borged up veteran in his mid-thirties.  <br/><br/>So, it starts as a differentiator from the troupe.  And a sort of sub-conscious use of one of those old creativity spurs: "how is this character different from you?"  <br/><br/>I've consistently been able to use a character's age to command respect, even from other PCs.  And there's something (more) interesting in playing from the viewpoint of the <i>de facto</i> establishment.<br/><br/>One thing that does strike me though is Robert's comment about the Hero's Journey, which I've always thought was kind of a pants game structure.  People keep mentioning it as if it were the be-all-end-all, and I've never understood their insistence or my own reaction to it, but I think there's a definite tie to the idea of older characters.  The cynical view would be that "Hero's Journey is teh roleplay!" is code for "Youth beats age, geezer!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M" title="Robert M"><img alt="Robert M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M">Robert M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70214/#Comment_70214" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T11:13:10+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 11:13AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judson,<br/><br/>I hope I came across as trying to describe my impression of why there is a predisposition in gaming systems, gamers, literature, etc... toward chronicling the "young folks" journey.  It seems historical, as in, "That's the way it has always been."  I wasn't trying to say that's the way it should be, or that it makes a good playing experience.  <br/><br/>Maybe the discussion should be framed in context of games being predisposed to the big transformation vs incremental transformation (if in fact they support transformation at all.)  Big transformation being defined as a journey contained within one campaign, at the end of which the character has become who they will be.  Incremental transformation being defined as the journey never ends, the hero in constant change.<br/><br/>As a youth perhaps we are predisposed to the big transformation.  We await the day we will become who we are to be.  As we age and find the big transformation to be a false path, we open ourselves up to the idea of playing the incremental transformation.  Maybe later we discover the path of incremental transformation to be too similar to our own lives, and we seek to play through the big transformation because it provides resolution, an end point, finality.  <br/><br/>It may also be that the big transformation is better equip to handle theme.  By providing finality, the effects of transformation can be clearly felt.  The moral of the story can be clearly demonstrated.  Incremental transformation leaves things messy, unresolved, life like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70222/#Comment_70222" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T11:27:02+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 11:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoy the dichotomy of the skill of experience vs the potential of youth.

I wanted to see a XXX where Sammy Jackson had to perform side by side with some young punk as they kick spy ass competitively.<br/><br/>Although not perfect I think Burning Wheel does this very well, in that younger mannish characters tend to have high stats, few skills and no-where-to-go-but-up where the older characters have lower stats and a boat load of stats.  I don't think the stats are low enough in BW since you gain stats from lifepaths as well but it's about the best their is at displaying those mechanical differences.  To the point that, mechanically speaking, most everyone WANTS to make someone as old as they can.

Certainly there is Literature as well as game play that has older folk experience the big transformation.  I think you have a great insight into why Hollywood is predisposed to younger Heroes.  (well that and sex sells!)<br/><br/>On the other hand (it was lurking out there, now you know it was) Greek Tragedy, as well as many other forms of Literature, does seem predisposed to covering the big transformation amongst two different subsets of groups, the oh-so-young (Electra, Antigone), and the married-with-children-but-yet-ready-to-hang-up-the-sword (Oedipus, Ulysses).  Is this because these points in our lives represent two crucial steps in human development?  The I'm-an-adult-now moment and the Mid-life-oh-this-is-what-it-means-to-be-an-adult moment?  Is it that these experiences are wired in?  Or is that since the beginning of time, women of a certain age and men of a certain age are more sexy to us, and that's what producers have delivered?

After Traveller, GDW used the general lifepath method for all of their RPGs as a house system. That said Traveller, and most like it, also make a point of countering the impetus to making old characters by having rules about how they characters become decripit with time. Starting with physical stats, but even reductions in mental ones as well in some cases. This is the "balance" to incentivize characters not always being pushed to be as old as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, you still always pushed in Traveller. Why? Because of anagathics (age mitigation drugs). That is, in play the usual course of action was for every character (who wasn't pushed out earlier due to the system) to save up enough money to get anagathics and pay for their monthly maintenence. Every character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if it was "ageism" in the system... it was just a balance mechanic. But I think that Traveller wasn't really trying to promote age as a positive factor. It was just the "realistic" way to create characters by their thinking. A way to have background associated with the end character's abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, what the system never addressed was development post career. Yes there was a development system in the game, but it was about taking classes, and, as such, making NPCs, you never gave them abilities beyond what the chargen system would give. Mostly you used pregen NPCs from JTAS and such, which pretty obviously came right from the chargen methods - in fact it would appear that they'd roll them up at random, and then give them interesting hooks. So, with anagathics, you'd have these 150 year old characters no better off than a 30 year old character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've always struggled with elves and what to do with them. If you've got a character who's 6000 years old... just how much does he know? 100 times as much as a 60 year old human?<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea, Paul (age as something worthy of respect). I think it's very subtly complex, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70622/#Comment_70622" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-20T11:05:33+00:00" title="May 20, 2007 11:05AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>The thing of it is, Robert, that there's nothing that says that older characters (amusing tangent: we seem to be defining 'older people' as 30+) can't have big transformation stories.

I think it's reasonable to give older characters more skills and deeper understanding of those skills, if you're something designed to feel less cinematic. And I like Andy's suggestion that they should get more connections, and the suggestion that there's more events in their backstory than for a younger character. Since the game I'm working on involves a lot of backstory being filled in during play, to me that suggests age as a mechanical bonus to creating deeper connections or more powerful events.</p>\n<p>But, even though I want my game to focus on older, wiser characters as being better, the young hotshot is a popular trope in space patrol fiction.
