Based on that experience and another gaming experience I had with "non-gamers" I have noticed that there are certain "soft skills" that gamers take for granted, but that seem to create a barrier to entry for non-gamers. These soft skills are either daunting or boring or otherwise difficult sell to non-gamers. And, I'm not sure why. The "soft skills" include (but probably aren't limited to) the following:<br/> <br/>-- maintaining the continuity in a story (i.e. remembering and respecting what happens scene to scene and even moment to moment within a scene)<br/><br/>-- playing a character in a story (i.e. considering what a character might actually do in a story including consequences of character action)<br/><br/>-- respecting rules (i.e. treating any rules as if they are important and not just pointless busy work)<br/><br/>These things seem obvious to my gamer friends, but are a real hurdle to my non-gamer friends. My non-gamer friends are bright, thoughtful, creative people who are certainly capable of playing a story game and would enjoy them I think (based on the Microscope experience). What's going on here do you think? Is there a way to overcome the barriers? Are gamers just hardwired differently?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411755/#Comment_411755" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T09:03:33+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  9:03AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of it is that gamers do, I think, tend to have some similar mental traits, especially in these fields. However, I think it's also experience, and a shared gaming culture. If you think of it--most people who are in gaming were introduced to it by friends, and thus have that culture to draw on. There's a certain flow to gaming that we know and respect.<br/><br/>However, I feel that the ones you point out are also more general story skills, and they can be easily learned. The first one is Aristotle's idea of "Unities" in narrative--that's an education in English right there. I'm somewhat saddened that there's people who don't understand something like that. The second is an acquired skill that could probably stand to have a lot more pointers in RPGs.<br/><br/>Respecting rules--that's a bit more basic. Heh. There's a point in gamers' general favor: respecting rules is a mark of maturity.<br/><br/>(Now let's see how long before this all gets labeled as a "problem of Lateral Dislocate gaming"...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411757/#Comment_411757" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T09:05:36+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  9:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            May it be that just like some people are shy at getting involved with a situation of real life they are not familiar with, some people are shy about prying in a wrong way into a fiction they are not familiar with? Complex rules (say, 3.5 level like) also seem to scare possible players away, while games that use skills they are already good at (like, uh, child-like pretending or common everyday storytelling skills) seem to be more approachable.<br/><br/>There's also the emotional component. I wouldn't be as comfortable approaching a table of serious mathematicians at work, nor a table of professional actors and poets (except for just watching), as I would be at a table of normal people who seem to be excited at something that actually resembles a game. Even the art and other emotional components of the game draw people who could be repelled by the rules complexity or any degree of distrust towards the strangers doing strange things on the table.<br/><br/>But you have to admit that even gamers are hardwired differently among themselves. I can read an RPG book and become interested and even excited about playing it just by imagining the possibilities. My best friend can't imagine these possibilities, he needs to play the game so it doesn't matter what I tell to get him interested. Another friend of mine doesn't care as long as we get to play something. The rest seem to be bent on trying to breake the game and have their own fun, but react surprisingly well to general consensus abut what may be more fun in every scene.<br/><br/>My take about breaking these barriers has been to introduce people to the hobbie first with either games with high GM fiat -with an experienced GM of course- or storytelling games without continuity boundaries, where everything they say can go. People eventually learn to put their own limits about what is fun and what isn't regarding the fiction and the group - remember the social contract isn't totally developed as any game starts, but keeps rectifying itself as sessions progress and players get to know each other's reactions and ways to have fun. But giving newcomers total freedom to enact their imagination helps them develope their imagination and reduce stress about talking weird things in public, until they no longer feel weird about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411758/#Comment_411758" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T09:56:51+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  9:56AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've introduced a lot of total gaming novices to RPGs of various kinds (primarily D&amp;D 3.5, Pathfinder, Fiasco, DW) and I don't think the barrier has anything to do with inherent skills capacities or whatever, it's entirely a question of experience.

These things take up a lot of mind space. How to interact with the players is one of those things. How to interact with the system is another. How to interact with the story is yet another.<br/><br/>For an experienced player, the "how to interact with the players" part is usually pretty easy. Think, however, of how this part is a little bit harder when you're playing with strangers at a convention. Then multiply that difficulty several times. That's what it's like for a person who is new to the hobby. So you can reduce this a bit by surrounding the new player with people they are comfortable with. But this will still take extra mind space because they are playing a game that takes place within the social interaction space, so they are learning how to do that.<br/><br/>For an experienced player, the "how to interact with the system" part is usually pretty easy, though it depends a bit on how familiar you are with the system and/or how similar the system is to other ones you are comfortable with. Think about how hard it is for some experienced gamers to play a system that is drastically different from what they are used to (a Pathfinder player, for example, playing Breaking The Ice). Again, multiply that by several times to get a sense of what it is like for someone new to the hobby to interact with a game system.<br/><br/>Between those 2 parts, which are usually pretty easy for an experienced player, you have a lot of mind space taken up.<br/><br/>There's not a lot left at that point to keep track of story continuity.<br/><br/>They'll get better at is as the first 2 parts get easier.\n<blockquote>-- playing a character in a story (i.e. considering what a character might actually do in a story including consequences of character action)</blockquote>\nSo there's these things that other people play, called computer games. And for most people coming in to the RPG hobby these days, that's the experience they have that is most similar to tabletop RPG play. In fact, they even call some of those computer games RPGs, which makes the association even more natural.<br/><br/>For most people, when they play a computer game, they play an avatar rather than a character. What I mean by the differentiation is this - an avatar is an extension of the player into the game world, while a character is it's own person with it's own goals. An avatar is a set of tools, while a character is a set of motivations.<br/><br/>So when those people come to the hobby, they tend to play using their "character" as an avatar, rather than as a character. That's totally natural.<br/><br/>The thing is, many experienced players do the same thing. I know I personally do it a lot. I often play using my "character" as an extension of my own will, rather than as a being with it's own motivations. But I've been doing this shit for 30 years, so I've gotten better at being subtle about it. When I show up to a one shot convention game, I mold the character I'm playing to fit my current mood, so that I can use that character to be my avatar in the game.<br/><br/>The new players you're playing with will also learn. The more often they play with people who subtly disapprove of obvious avatar play, the more they will either learn to be subtle about it or to embrace character driven play. Or maybe some of both.\n<blockquote>-- respecting rules (i.e. treating any rules as if they are important and not just pointless busy work)</blockquote>\nAgain, much of this is computer game training. In many computer games, it's fun to try to break the rules, or at least to try to tweak them.<br/><br/>Many games reward you for doing bizzaro wacky stuff that your character would never want to do, like giving you an achievement for throwing yourself off of a particularly large cliff in spectacular fashion. So it's not surprising that players want to explore wackiness sometimes rather than staying tight to the rules.<br/><br/>And hell, treating game rules as pointless busy work has a long history in the RPG hobby as well. It's a pretty rare group that actually uses the encumbrance rules in old D&amp;D (though there is a recent revival in embracing that hardcore sim rules and finding the fun in them, which is cool).<br/><br/>Again, I've been playing RPGs for 30 years. And I have an analyst's mind. I've been hacking systems for forever - I was playing a friend's homebrew game in 4th grade. It's only very recently that I've actually come across games that I've read and wanted to play straight out of the book. <br/><br/>So it is not surprising to me at all that players would not see the importance in meticulously following the rules. It's only in certain games that the rules consistently drive the fun. And as new players, they have a hard time seeing how the rules are attempting to do that. Hell, they may never really see that. More than half of the people I play with can't analyze game rule system structures for shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411764/#Comment_411764" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T10:47:44+00:00" title="April 10, 2013 10:47AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm more worried about newcomer GMs in the case of people who take those responsabilities without previous playing experience.

You become aware that there is a whole set of nebulous assumptions and conventions experienced players have that probably weren't read or written in any gaming text. It's sort of fascinating that these giant arguably super important parts of any game aren't often in the rules . . . but encumbrance is. I wonder why tracking the events in the fiction has been historically prioritized over explaining how to create the fiction in the first place.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411770/#Comment_411770" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T12:33:19+00:00" title="April 10, 2013 12:33PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2013 12:33PM by Hans_c-o.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>-- maintaining the continuity in a story (i.e. remembering and respecting what happens scene to scene and even moment to moment within a scene)<br/><br/>-- playing a character in a story (i.e. considering what a character might actually do in a story including consequences of character action)<br/><br/>-- respecting rules (i.e. treating any rules as if they are important and not just pointless busy work)<br/><br/>These things seem obvious to my gamer friends, but are a real hurdle to my non-gamer friends.

I don't think it's super obvious to completely new players who are accustomed to "making a move"  or "taking a turn" in a board game that when they "make a move" in an RPG they are creating part of a cohesive fictional whole and that when their "turn" is over, their character is "still there" in the fiction. <br/><br/>Gamers recognize that a character sheet is merely a shorthand description of a fictional construct that is separate from the player.  I think that, for some new players, the notion that they are anything but themselves when they play the game can be an alien concept.

But I think you're misidentifying them. Or identifying ones that are rarely a huge issue as being big huge issues.\n<blockquote>I think that, for some new players, the notion that they are anything but themselves when they play the game can be an alien concept. It's a leap to understand that "making a character" is not the same thing as choosing the thimble when you play Monopoly.</blockquote>\nRecent counter-example. I was playing Bang!, the card game, with some non-gamer friends recently. In that game, you have roles, and you have different goals based on what role you are. And nobody knows who is what role, except for the Sheriff. (It's similar to Werewolf/Mafia, but with more card game action added.)<br/><br/>I was the Sheriff and my neighbor was the Deputy. The game says the Deputy's goal is to make the Sheriff win (by helping to kill the Outlaws and the Renagade). We were down to the end of the game and it was the Sheriff, the Deputy, and an Outlaw left. My neighbor, playing the Deputy, shot and killed the Sheriff. I asked her why she did that. She said "I thought I could become the Sheriff and take over." This wasn't just her misunderstanding the rules. She had started making roleplaying decisions based on her role in the card game - she was taking actions based on the kind of Deputy she wanted to portray.<br/><br/>I see this rather often in board/card games that have strong character elements. Players who do not play roleplaying games will often make character-driven decisions rather than strategy-driven decisions. I think it is common for non-gamers to easily slide into making character-based decisions. I almost never see experienced roleplayers do this - it's easy for them to know that when playing a card game, you make your decisions based on victory strategy, not character goals.<br/><br/>I think the difficulty that you are seeing with new players in roleplaying games has more to do with the fact that they are trying to juggle lots of new things in their head at the same time. The more complicated the other things are - a complicated combat system, a complicated mystery scenario, a complicated set of new people to interact with - the more they will struggle with things they would otherwise be comfortable with. As they gain competence with those other parts (or those complications are simplified by choosing simple systems and scenarios and playing with people they know), they'll have more brain space to spend on story and character stuff, and they'll handle it plenty well.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>A similar thing I learned about when learning to be an English teacher. When a student is writing using an unfamiliar format or about an unfamiliar subject matter, they will do worse with "basic skills" like grammar and spelling. When they gain more competence with the subject matter and/or the format, their ability to apply their basic skills will go back up again.<br/><br/>I see the same thing as a professional technical writer. If I'm writing about stuff that I'm really struggling to understand, I make more spelling and grammar errors. And I'll use less optimal sentence structures and word choices. I need to do more editing of my work. But when I write about things I understand better, my writing itself is better.<br/><br/>When you have competence at a complicated skill - and roleplaying is a rather complicated set of skills - it's hard to understand why people seem to struggle with the most basic parts. Often it's because they are focusing all their brainpower on the more complicated bits and have less to spare for the rest. Once they gain competence at the complicated bits, the more basic stuff will return.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411779/#Comment_411779" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T14:17:43+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  2:17PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Gamers recognize that a character sheet is merely a shorthand description of a fictional construct that is separate from the player.

In my experience it's WAY harder to get experienced gamers to "lead with the fiction" and "be obvious" rather than just choosing an appropriate stat, skill, or move off of their character sheet. Likewise, when it comes to the problem of just playing yourself in the fiction, I hardly think that's specific to novices!<br/><br/>As for the "leaps," I feel like you're exaggerating - these people aren't idiots, and the concept of "we're going to make up a story together, in which we each decide what one of the characters does" doesn't take all that long to internalize. By the end of a game of Fiasco, every novice at the table will understand that fully. I'm not super familiar with Microscope, but maybe these hurdles have more to do with the crazy fractal scope of that game than with gaming in general?<br/><br/>Another thing that might be a factor here, I think, is that the novices <i>themselves</i> might be overstating their own inability to make those leaps because they're daunted or feel like outsiders. Self-deprecation is a pretty common nervous reaction when confronted with something you're not familiar with. This is why it's so important to create a friendly, comfortable, low-pressure environment in which to learn how to play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411780/#Comment_411780" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T14:47:23+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  2:47PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps the very simple and goofy is all that most non-committed hobbyists want from SGs/RPGs?<br/><br/>I mean, not always, but it does strike me that lots and lots of players never seem to grok much about rpgs than "this is a form of organized, subject limited play-pretend" nor have much interest in further understanding.<br/><br/>But they do seem to have fun when engaged in it.<br/><br/>If this is true, or sometimes-true-often-enough-to-ponder-on-the-subject, what is to be learned from this?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411788/#Comment_411788" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T18:20:38+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  6:20PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Perhaps the very simple and goofy is all that most non-committed hobbyists want from SGs/RPGs?<br/><br/>I mean, not always, but it does strike me that lots and lots of players never seem to grok much about rpgs than "this is a form of organized, subject limited play-pretend" nor have much interest in further understanding.<br/><br/>But they do seem to have fun when engaged in it.<br/><br/>If this is true, or sometimes-true-often-enough-to-ponder-on-the-subject, what is to be learned from this?<br/></blockquote>\nI suspect part of it is not seeing any reason to further invest in it. Gaining that experience requires a particular investment into gaming. It's just like some people might casually watch a few episodes of a TV show, and then decide "it's not for me". (I <b>will</b> say that there's probably a high portion of geeks who are not inclined to do things by halves like that, who'd never even consider the idea of "casually" checking out a book or a movie.)<br/><br/>They don't grok RPGs, perhaps, because they haven't really tried.

But if a rule doesn't seem to be about winning, then it doesn't matter (when you are inclined towards winning). Nar falls under a similar principle (take the riddle of steels spiritual attributes and gaining another die for pursuing a spiritual attribute (pass or fail) - more dice! For playing the character they set out to play! It matters - but even in TROS, the encumberance rules - kinda ignored). But you know, without AP what I'm saying is a stab in one direction, when there are alot of directions available.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411833/#Comment_411833" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T07:02:59+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  7:02AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2013 7:06AM by Felan.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But none of that sounds specific to novices.

I admire the stuff, I look at the fun they have with it, but not really for me ( certainly not to the extent of sitting down and making the effort to really grok the stuff they play).<br/><br/>OTOH, there are things like wii and Kinect and some online really simple games. Caesar_X at one point was involved in making the latter sort of thing for the non-hobbyist video gamer market. I do have fun with those kinds of things.

I'm not super familiar with Microscope, but maybe these hurdles have more to do with the crazy fractal scope of that game than with gaming in general?<br/></blockquote></blockquote>\nWell, that's fair. I probably am exaggerating. Or, anyway, I haven't yet been able to put my finger on exactly what seemed so different in the approach by the non-hobbyists. It's not that the players literally couldn't grasp the concept of story continuity. It's more that they just didn't care about it -- and because they didn't care about it, they were fast and loose with the fiction. You know how Miracle the horse shows up at the end of History of the World Part I? (If you havent' seen that movie -- it's funny) It was like that. <br/><br/>With regard to adhering to the rules. As as been noted upthread, even experienced gamers disregard rules beyond some point of saturation. I think that point happens sooner with people who aren't familiar with roleplaying games -- which are games that have A LOT of rules both explicit and implicit. When non-hobbyists want to play a game, they want, I think, to get to the fun thing right away and they don't want their fun side-tracked or stalled by referencing rules (either in a book or in their heads). \n<blockquote>My curiosity is if there is an interest in creating for that group and an understanding of that group, and what that would mean in terms of design and presentation.</blockquote>\nMy light bulb moment from all of this is that non-gamers aren't afraid to roleplay. Playing a character in a scene does not appear to be a hinderance -- at least not in my teeny tiny sample group. It's the other stuff -- both soft skills like concentrating on the details of a story for an extended period of time and harder skills like the mastery of more than a few game specific concepts/subsystems. <br/><br/>If I were to run a version of Microscope again for my non-gamer friends, I would cut out a bunch of it. No legacy, no focus, no lens, no periods. I'd make Person A come up with an Event and Person B ask a question about that Event and then make a scene to answer that question. And, we'd just move around the circle doing that.Then I'd put the events/scenes in chronological order. I feel like that would work. I also feel like the non-gamers might appreciate some kind of win condition -- but maybe not.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411840/#Comment_411840" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T08:07:42+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  8:07AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah!

You were expecting dramatic continuity, they were expecting comedic disruption and fragmentation - both of these are valid approaches to storytelling, but I can understand how it would be frustrating if everyone wasn't on the same page. As you mentioned in your original approach, I can see how moving from Cards Against Humanity to another game would maybe colour the players' approach. In a way it's kind of odd that moment-to-moment continuity of space and action is so deeply ingrained in most RPGs - where are the Mel Brooks games? Where are the French New Wave games?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411854/#Comment_411854" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T10:34:31+00:00" title="April 11, 2013 10:34AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2013 10:34AM by AMBayard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>In a way it's kind of odd that moment-to-moment continuity of space and action is so deeply ingrained in most RPGs - where are the Mel Brooks games?

Which kinda sounds great to me, actually.<br/><br/>[Not for everything! I mean, I want to play Microscope as written when I get it. But it seems like there's room for a more basic game along those lines.]<br/><br/>Also, going along with that and the idea of win conditions, an observation: lots of people I've played games with don't actually like competition all that much. They like some challenge, a little bit of competition here and there, but in a way they mostly like win conditions as a shut off switch. It lets you know as a group that play has ended. It's strictly incidental that one person is declared a winner. Apples to Apples seems like that sort of thing, and a number of eurogame style games seem similar when I play them with friends ( although I understand some people are quite serious about them. Still, they don't seem nearly as directly and actively competitive as more common American games like Risk or Monopoly).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411865/#Comment_411865" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T14:05:45+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  2:05PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2013 2:06PM by Felan.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An anecdote: when I ran Lady Blackbird for the first time, one of my players was a gaming novice - some board game experience, minimal video game experience, no RPG experience whatsoever beyond the (awesome) D&amp;D episodes of Community and Freaks &amp; Geeks.<br/><br/>The game went really well, I was asking questions and using the answers like a boss, Novice played Lady Blackbird and picked it up really quickly, and we were all having a blast. Then, about 3/4 of the way through the session, after failing a roll or something, Novice said something to the effect of "Aw, damn! Oh well, the only thing I care about is beating [Other Player]." This resulted in a funny moment where the rest of us looked around and realized that Novice had been playing "to win" (even though we hadn't identified any particular win conditions or goals other than what's baked into the game as written). We all laughed and Novice right away realized that the game didn't need to be competitive, and we kept going. BUT what I loved about this is that <i>nobody noticed</i> that Novice was playing to win - in fact,trying to put Lady Blackbird ahead of the other players made Novice's characterization and roleplaying really effective and exciting.<br/><br/>There's probably a lesson in there somewhere. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411867/#Comment_411867" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T14:33:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  2:33PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sociologically speaking, I'll take novices over grognards any day of the week.

This resulted in a funny moment where the rest of us looked around and realized that Novice had been playing "to win" (even though we hadn't identified any particular win conditions or goals other than what's baked into the game as written). We all laughed and Novice right away realized that the game didn't need to be competitive, and we kept going.

It's very clear and it's certainly not too complicated. And, I would not advocate its amendment for players who are open to the range of its possibilities. My suggested changes are for the limited case of the specific group I played with (or similar groups). All they really wanted was a chance to play little funny scenes within the loose structure of a "game" while they drank wine.

Part of that may simply come from the tendency for people to learn any sort of game by jumping in and playing with some sort of mentor and possibly never reaching the point of actually digging into the rules text at all by themselves.<br/><br/>Of course, it isn't something strictly limited to RPGs. I think many of us could step back, think about other sorts of games we play, and we might be shocked to consider what percentage of them we engaged in regularly before ever even looking at the rules text, assuming we ever actually did at all.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412050/#Comment_412050" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T07:57:38+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  7:57AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2013 7:58AM by AMBayard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Maybe the answer is that they shouldn't!

Maybe we associate "playing pretend" with childhood because that's the time when most people do it for the first time, and not because it actually has anything to do with childhood.

Although, when it comes to the assumption that, though we could have chatted about sex earlier, <i>this</i> conversation will <i>not</i> be about that, I dunno who's more likely to err, the noob or the veteran.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412307/#Comment_412307" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T20:55:23+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  8:55PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Agreed - part of why I bristle a bit at the idea of non-gamers lacking some kind of inherent gaming capacity is because too often <i>novicehood</i> is conflated with <i>being-a-woman</i>.
