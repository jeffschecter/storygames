As a teen I parroted a lot of the pro-curve argument I had heard (in the GURPS camp and other places) but the more I kept thinking about it the more value I put in the clear and intuitive probability that static linear gives. Like 1d6 as per Gumshoe is actually pretty sweet &amp; simple. 1d20 is good because it has finer granularity while still being a single die.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen so many disastrous &amp; mathematically iffy rule designs coming from dice pool camps over the years.

I know that goes against what I said about prefering static linear.</p><p>I love Fudge dice because while they do hide the math, I know the [1,4,10,16,19,16,10,4,1]/81 chain by heart, bonuses are often small and doesn\u2019t throw the probability off by too much etc (or so I thought before Fate started throwing around +4 and +6 here and there). Like I see Fudge dice as essentially a way to have a low-but-knowable percentage chance of outlier results but hidden and unobtrusive math. The triangle tables that were popular in the Fate 3 era was a great innovation as well. If I were to make my own game I\u2019d base it on 4dF.</p><p>Similarly board games like Hero Quest, you can learn your probability chains if you want to design for it, but if you just want to use theready made stuff you don\u2019t have to spend time with numbers and adding, just count up the skulls&amp;shields.</p><p>Again, what we learned during the system matters era is that this <strong>dice system design is such a miniscule part of what makes a good game</strong>.

Then the dice are all "Eh, whatevs to your character concepts, you rolled a 4 and he rolled a 14 and he shows you up."  This is not precisely a function of linear dice mechanics so much as it is a function of the size of the random range on the d20 (too damn big) vs the amount of differentiation in characters, but it is mitigated by methods that make it less likely. <br/><br/>I really have no problems with diminishing returns.  If people can't be trusted with them, I regard that as their own difficulty.<br/><br/>I agree that game designers should have a firm grasp on the math of their systems and how it works, but I argue that that is actually awfully easy to get in a "design" way, because you can just sit down, teach  yourself Anydice, and ergo, you know how all the dice permutations in your game work and can make sure you file off the weird edge cases (and they honestly have to be pretty weird to damage the game, though it's absolutely possible.)   You have months and months of time to figure this stuff out, so unless you've designed some kind of gonzo crazy dice system (and some folks sure have -- games with stuff like making sets out of your rolled dice is impressively obfuscating) you should damn well understand it.   This is, in fact, my expectation of ALL games, and I don't think that dice pools vs linear sets meaningfully influences the amount of time required for a DESIGNER to do this.   It's a question of whether they care enough to do it, not a question of whether they can.  It's very possible to design a game with fundamentally broken mechanics just using a flat d20 plus bonuses methodology if you don't care enough to be rigorous on the design side, and if you do care enough on the design side, then the complexity of your dice mechanic isn't going to impede you.<br/><br/>tldr: I don't think "it's easier for the designer to understand" is a merit in a dice system at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473242/#Comment_473242" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-03T20:30:05+00:00" title="May  3, 2018  8:30PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/vgunn" rel="nofollow">vgunn</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Would you consider Roll &amp; Keep (L5R/7th Sea)?</p></div></blockquote>\nListed as "Dynamic pool, best of"</div></blockquote>\nMissed that, thanks!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473247/#Comment_473247" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-03T21:03:04+00:00" title="May  3, 2018  9:03PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2018 9:11PM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Also the other reason I don\u2019t like pools is that I like seeing the result the second the dice hit the table. \u201cOK if this die hits a 13 or higher I hit!\u201d</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I definitely agree with mabgriff; One of the things that pisses me off about D&amp;D is when I have a character who is literally the best they can be at a given thing at a given level, and my buddy is playing someone who is pretty bumbling at said thing (Say, +6 with ability score/proficiency vs -1 total). Then the dice are all \u201cEh, whatevs to your character concepts, you rolled a 4 and he rolled a 14 and he shows you up.\u201d</p></div></blockquote><p>So +6 vs -1 means you beat them around 77% of the time (80% if you include ties). I like that well enough for situations where there\u2019s a point in rolling.</p><p>The equivalent 3d6 contest is 3d6+3 vs 3d6-1.</p><p>Contested rolls in d20 D&amp;D have a granularity of 1/400, that is to say 0.25%. If you want it set up so that the bumbler has a 0.25% chance of beating the literally the best, you can. +18 vs -1 for example.</p><p>3d6+6 vs 3d6-1 is the equivalent of 1d20+12 vs 1d20+1.</p><p>D&amp;D has a constant granularity which is what makes the probabilities more intuitive for most people, I\u2019ve noticed. Not that they always know the exact probability percent but they know that \u201ca little better is a little better\u201d in a way that maps well with how it actually is. 3d6 vs 3d6 has a granularity that varies from 1/46656 at its finest to 4332/46656 (around 9%) at its coarsest. In other words, near the middle of the curve you take steps that are over 240 times coarser than D&amp;D\u2019s finest (edge) granularity!</p><p><b>Edit:</b> To clarify my point here: if you want to set up a somewhat <i>close</i> contest in 3d6, that's hard to do because the close steps are so coarse.

They use the word "average" indiscriminately, so that mean, median, and mode are conflated. When they ask "what's the average result on 1d20?" the answer is 10.5, which is both the mean and median. But then they will, in many cases, unconsciously assume it is the mode as well (or, since 10.5 isn't actually in the set of outcomes, that the mode is 10/11). Students almost never make the distinction between "this is the average outcome among all outcomes" and "this is the outcome that is most likely" until they are painstakingly taught to do so.<br/><br/>I can absolutely see the value in the uniform, linear increments provided by a static linear system. However, I have found that people tend to assume that, on any given roll of a die, they are more likely to roll near the "average" than far away from it.<br/><br/>Optimistically, I'm saying that any system models <i>some</i> of the intuition people have about probability.<br/><br/>Pessimistically, I'm saying that most people will make wrong assumptions about probability no matter what dice system you use <img alt=":sweat:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sweat.png" title=":sweat:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473270/#Comment_473270" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T05:47:45+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  5:47AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both your optimism and pessimism are simply true. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473271/#Comment_473271" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T05:53:09+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  5:53AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I've seen that too, many times (just as recently as Airk right now expressing frustration with the 4 vs 14 rolls in the context of a desire of a random range more... centered, settled on the middle), where the curves go so wrong is when people are evaluating changes, mods, circumstances, leveling up etc.<br/><br/>People hate the "swinginess" of d20 (sidenote: I'm so happy that no-one has used that word in this thread so far) because they want the ability mod to be... respected.

The thing i found most annoying about dming when i was younger was coming up with random dc's on the fly. Now I'd just use 10,15, or 20 (i think theres some guidance for this in the books, so I'd use whatever that is).<br/><br/>Same should happen on the player side, if I have an option of rolling 1-6 dice in their dice pool, I don't need to know probabilities just something that tells me rolling 6 dice vs difficulty 3 is good, 4 vs difficulty 2 is good, 2 vs difficulty 1 is good or what have you.<br/><br/>People consistently misestimate how good odds are anyway. With the 66% feeling like 50% if its in their favour thing. So being able to easily work out the percentages of their success likelihood with a static linear dice system doesn't necessarily mean they'll actually feel satisfied by this. So the designer should put the work in to tell us what dice configurations make things easy, medium, or hard (or however fine grained they like) and make sure those settings actually feel that way.

To get that 3 or that 18 is only one in 216 \u2014 outlier results.<br/><br/>In some sense, the 16 outcomes (some only one in 216) only end up as three: win, lose and tie. And the same goes for the 20 outcomes. There are <b>three</b> distinct outcomes.<br/><br/>When I see someone roll that 4, I don't see "Oh, damn, a 4 is as probable as a 14 on this flat die", I see "OK, they rolled one of the few numbers that caused them to lose; there were more numbers that would've caused them to win but luck weren't with them."<br/><br/>The reason I'm not taking your argument seriously is because this whole view of the outcome ranges is one I <b>so</b> often see misunderstood online (it's the Monte Hall door switching problem of RPG design) and I can't help at least thinking there's a <i>chance</i> you're also misunderstanding it in that way.

I can think of many advantages to "diminishing returns" systems, particularly if the structure of play intends for us to look for and stack bonuses, for instance (a disincentive to pursuing that goal indefinitely, at the expense of fun at the table).<br/><br/>If we're just collecting opinions:<br/><br/>* I find linear rolls nice and clear, but too limiting as a designer. I want my dice rolls to have lots of different inputs and outputs, and a linear roll doesn't give me many ways to deal with that, which limits what I can design.<br/><br/>It's also very difficult to fit in "outliers", because the least common outcomes are still pretty common. (e.g. In D&amp;D, if you want the possibility of someone shooting themselves in the foot when they roll badly, it's hard to get that below 5%, which is really not fun odds for shooting yourself in the foot! The "ice moon" story would have been far worse in D&amp;D, in other words, than it was in GURPS, where it was roughly 20 times less likely to happen.)<br/><br/>* I *like* nonintuitive odds in games, so long as it's clear whether they are increasing or decreasing. I'd rather be thinking - and rather my players be thinking - "Hey, I really want to get this guy, and if I can just get behind him, I'll have Advantage, which means I might be get him!", instead of, "My odds are 60% here, but I could get them up to 85% by getting behind my enemy." The former "feels" more like the right space I'd want to be in as a gamer.<br/><br/>I've been playing <i>Tales of Entropy</i> lately, and it's been a pretty interesting experience. You can't really gauge your odds of success at all, because so many other things change between the moment when you collect your dice and the final outcome. However, you have valuable and impactful input every step of the way.<br/><br/>This means that, going into a conflict, I have no idea what my odds are at all, but, during the conflict, I can still make meaningful moves to affect those odds every step of the way. It feels like I'm fighting for victory (and each move makes a difference!) but the uncertainty is always there. I find that very cool. I'm thinking, "Is it worth it for me to fight this fight?", instead of, "Hmmm, my odds of winning are only 35%. Should I go for it?"<br/><br/>As a designer, sure, I need to be able to figure out specific odds, but that's not such a huge stumbling block, I think. And the math can be fun!<br/><br/>I understand the counterpoints, too, though. Ultimately, these aren't huge issues to me, so long as the game itself works well.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473322/#Comment_473322" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T17:36:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  5:36PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>On a flat 1d20 line, going from +1 to +2 is around the same bonus as going from +7 to +8. </p></div></blockquote>\nActually not necessarily, I've run some Monte Carlo combat simulations (of d20 AD&amp;D and Normal Distribution Cold Iron) and the first +1 that takes success from 50-50 to 55-45 actually makes the most impact.<br/><br/>I also realized that D&amp;D combat is NOT static linear... Since D&amp;D combat is resolved over the course of several rolls, it's actually Dynamic Pool (Summing).<br/><br/>You make a good point that understanding the probabilities of success with a d100 system are easy to intuit (you need a 30 or less, 30% chance of success), but I suspect most folks who actually understand that also quickly intuit the chances of success with other systems.<br/><br/>Also, the die rolling mechanism is tied into other aspects of the system. Burning Wheel's die rolls tie into the Artha and advancement systems, encouraging trying for high target numbers while also allowing for help and forks to increase the number of dice rolled to make those 6's more likely so Fate can be spent.<br/><br/>Ultimately, in my experience, many different die rolling systems work. D&amp;D's 3d6 for characteristics and d20 for to hit works. RuneQuest's percentile rolls work. Traveller's 2d6 rolls work. Burning Wheel's dice pools work. Cold Iron's normal distribution works.<br/><br/>I'm actually trying to think of a game system where I could lay failure of the system to work on the die rolling mechanism.<br/><br/>Now I'm not sure all those systems work the way they do because the designer carefully designed the dice systems. Some of the game is emergent based on the chosen mechanics. And I think that's just fine - I think it's fun to discover how the game actually plays and what's actually important in the game rather than just intuit it from a quick read of the rule book.<br/><br/>Frank<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473324/#Comment_473324" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T17:40:31+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  5:40PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand the feeling of "I rewrote that five times in an effort to sound less like a jerk, and apparently it's still upsetting" so no hard feelings, but I don't really want to go back here.  I'm pretty convinced that neither of us are ACTUALLY being logical here and though you seem to be trying, I don't think that helps.<br/><br/>I want to make it clear though, that I DON'T calculate probabilities when playing games, so any argument based on how those numbers change when you do certain things is in fact irrelevant (at best) to me.  Much like Paul, I LIKE not being able to figure out my exact chance, because I want to be making decisions based on how much I want a thing/how important it feels to my character and not "Well, that actually only a 4% increase in my odds, so who cares?" Screw that. I'm here to play games, not figure out probabilities, and I think that the view that transparent probability is important because "OMG how else will you figure out what your chances are?" is missing the point completely and basically founded on a defective premise -- that you "should" be doing the math and figuring these things out so you can make informed decisions as if your character would know that doing a certain thing would give him/her a clearly defined percentage increase in their chance of success.
