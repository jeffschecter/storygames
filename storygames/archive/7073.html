I'd like to play a game with them. Something simple and fun that's fast to explain and will be a good time the first time through.<br/><br/>I cannot buy anything, and I'm on the road, so I can't print anything. <br/><br/>Tricky, right? Maybe.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear some suggestions. My current ideas include:<br/><br/>--Red Box Hack, using my own "Adventure Creation Procedure". But I'm unsure what the current state of the RBH is.<br/>--In a Wicked Age: I think I know all the rules now, even though I've never played it and don't own the book. (Any major dangers here?)<br/>--My Pool/TSoY hack. However, it needs a quick method for the creation of a scenario (preferably one that involves the whole group, not just me). I have some ideas for this, but would like to hear yours.<br/><br/>So, help!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lemon" title="lemon"><img alt="lemon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lemon">lemon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157354/#Comment_157354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T09:50:54+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  9:50AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a Wicked Age is a great game, but not that great for one-shots.

Make up some skills if you want to and hand out some skill points; about 10 ought to do it. Attack rolls are based on your related Stat+skill. Defense rolls are the same, minus 2.

I'm not looking so much for system suggestions (1. I'm traveling and don't have anything with me, so "Play X" is not very helpful, and 2. I have several rules-lite concepts I can fall back on).<br/><br/>I'm looking more for, perhaps, ways of putting together a one-shot quickly--and, preferably, collaboratively.<br/><br/>For instance, since I have the Keys, any of you who have run or participated in TSoY one-shots (especially like the TSoY Dungeon Crawl posted here a while back)--can you suggest a way I could create something like that quickly and at the table? Are there Key combinations that work particularly well? If so, how I can get the players to buy into them without feeling too constrained? Anyone have a method like this?<br/><br/>(I'm actually half-tempted to use Jason Morningstar's setup from "Dulse", but with a GM and conflict res thrown in. Jason, if you're reading this, would that work, do you think?)<br/><br/>Thanks for all the responses so far!

So, from the get-go, the characters were at each other's throats and the whole thing was a mess (a sticky, fun mess, mind you), with violence, double-crossing, etc. I think it was mostly because it was and we were tired.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was a good evening, and I consider it a successful first playtest of Winter Crucible. Indeed, you don't have to try too hard with Keys: I needn't have worried. A bunch of character with a few Keys each and the game ran itself. I'm looking forward to a more serious game using a similar ruleset--it could be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the advice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
