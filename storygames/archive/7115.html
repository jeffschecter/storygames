It's a GMful game where players use resources on their character sheets to build scenes and pose their own threats to overcome. The tone is intended to reflect TV shows which have lots of fight scenes &amp; stunt set pieces but also features extensive character development.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm currently trying to put together a list of sample character traits to show potential players the sorts of things they can put on their character sheets. There are two types of trait in particular which I think are difficult to explain properly, so I need lots of examples (and possibly better defintions than mine if anyone wants to have a go)<br/>\n<br/>\nConditions are physical circumstances that affect the character's perormance of skills, so some samples are:<br/>\n - Ambushed<br/>\n - Outnumbered<br/>\n - In a burning building<br/>\n - With a gun to my head<br/>\n - Unarmed<br/>\n - On a rooftop<br/>\n<br/>\nAims are goals or motivations specific to the character's current action or scene, so some samples are:<br/>\n - Its my job<br/>\n - I swore an oath<br/>\n - I have to protect my secrets<br/>\n - I want revenge<br/>\n - They're blackmailing me<br/>\n - I have to keep them distracted<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone think of any more?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
