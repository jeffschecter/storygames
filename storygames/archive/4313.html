I thought I'd share. <br/><br/>A little background: The PC Jedi have recently arrived at a planet where the political situation is so fraught that we agreed to ban political or historical discussion to prevent acrimony between players. It has settlers uprooting the indigenous population, who fight back with violence... you get the idea. One of the major players in this situation is a Sith Lord who styles herself Darth Cerit. She used to be a Jedi herself, and is the twin sister of a PC Jedi, Loretilia (Til). <br/><br/>Almost as soon as they set foot on this planet the PCs stumble onto a battle between Darth Cerit and Veonard Cottiere, an ex-Jedi who's leading the indigenous people's terror attacks. The most obvious way to frame the Conflict at hand was to take Darth Cerit in a four-on-one fight (three PC Knights and Cottiere), with the Stakes being whether to capture the Sith Lord. <br/><br/>But that, we agreed, was pretty boring in three ways. First, there was practically no contest. Second, the Conflict would drag on seriously with five different participants. Third, the players didn't really want to capture Darth Cerit. They'd matched wits with her before and found her entertaining. Besides which, she brought up way too many conflicting emotions in Loretilia to be neutralized so easily. <br/><br/>I finally suggested another way to frame the Conflict. What if we made it a one-on-one Conflict between Darth Cerit and Til, with Darth Cerit trying to drag her sister down to the Dark Side and Til resisting? The outer conflict would be a lightsaber battle, with all the Jedi flashing 'sabers and defying gravity, but the <i>real</i> conflict would be between the sisters with Til's soul at stake. No matter what the outcome Darth Cerit would be captured, for the time being, but would eventually escape. <br/><br/>The players agreed, and oh man if that wasn't a hell of a conflict. Darth Cerit's Raises included her embracing her sister in the middle of the battle, calling up memories of their old camaraderie. She also attacked Til's comrades, trying to provoke rage in her, and taunted Til that she'd destroy everything dear to her including the Republic. Loretilia's Raises and Sees included telling her sister they could never go back to the way they used to be, and throwing herself in harm's way for her fellow Jedi. <br/><br/>Loretilia won in the end but did take a hell lot of Fallout, and when the player rolled them all Til was in serious trouble. However, she didn't take any serious bodily wounds during the course of the Conflict. What we decided to do was to defer the result of the Fallout to the end of the follow-up conflict, which was between Veonard Cottiere and another PC Jedi over the fate of the prisoner. Cottiere wanted to kill Darth Cerit right away before she did more harm. The PC Jedi, Zarax, on the other hand absolutely refused to see an unarmed prisoner killed. <br/><br/>Just when Cottiere would have Escalated to lightsabers, Darth Cerit retrieved her 'saber with the Force ('unarmed' being a relative state for a Force user), stabbed her sister, and took advantage of the confusion to escape. Loretilia collapsed, and the third PC Jedi acted as physician in a third Conflict with Til's life at stake. So deferring the result of Fallout worked out quite nicely, with lots of dramatic ups and downs. <br/><br/>The way I see it, d10 Fallout basically means that the player cared enough about the outcome of a Conflict to risk his character, not necessarily that the Conflict itself was enough to kill the character. Therefore there seems to be some license in just when to have the result of Fallout surface--unlike with more conventional damage systems like lost HP, which absolutely means that you took that much damage, right then. <br/><br/>So the session was basically a series of three Conflicts, centered around one PC but with all the characters getting their moment to shine. For me it really brought home the importance of framing a Conflict to squeeze maximum dramatic payoff from a situation, and also the usefulness of deferring Fallout. <br/><br/>It also turns out that having a recurring villain isn't necessarily about the villain having mondo stats and wiping the floor with the PCs. With her randomly-generated stats, Darth Cerit wouldn't have lasted five rounds against the combined wrath of four Jedi. The point was that the players <i>wanted</i> to let her go, even if the PCs emphatically didn't, and we accordingly set the stakes so she'd come back another day to mess with her sister's head. <br/><br/>So that was our game. It's at times like this that I love Dogs so much it hurts. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97142/#Comment_97142" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T09:13:41+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  9:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And this, dear friends, is why stakes setting is a skill to wield well.

Now that I think about it there were also a couple of issues with the session that I wanted to throw out there. <br/><br/>While the central conflict (does Darth Cerit turn Loretilia to the Dark Side?) worked pretty well, its backdrop--the action sequence for the other three Jedi--was rather fragmented and listless. Both the players and I had trouble finding our bearings outside the Raise-See flow. <br/><br/>If this situation happens again, where only a few of the participants in the scene are actually in conflict, I think it might be a better idea if everyone narrated as part of the Raise-See cycle even if they don't roll or put forward dice, as kind of faux Raises and Sees. I do wonder how the individual actions would resolve without dice involved, though. <br/><br/>Another issue that caught my interest was that some of the stakes of the Conflict weren't very clearly communicated. I was kind of surprised by how hard Loretilia's player fought the Conflict, to the point of racking up six d10 Fallout. I commented that the player must have <i>really</i> cared about not letting Loretilia be tempted by the Dark Side, if he was willing to risk her death for it. The player answered that he hadn't been sure just what it would mean for Til to fall to the Dark Side, whether she'd go the full Dark Jedi monte or just give into her emotions and struggle with the issue afterward. <br/><br/>Now I certainly could have been clearer about what I meant by Loretilia being tempted or falling, but then again stakes-setting is hardly a GM-only job. I think the player should have asked me to be clearer and actively negotiated the terms of the conflict. His caring enough about the conflict to risk his PC is great; his fighting the thing out tooth and nail because he felt he had no information or control over his protagonist's fate, not so great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97411/#Comment_97411" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T20:55:06+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  8:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, he must have assumed it was bad if he risked the fallout.

After talking to the player a bit more, it turned out he actually did prefer the character dying to her falling to the Dark Side. I just wish I'd been clearer about what exactly "falling" entailed so he could have made the decision with more certainty. It's so easy to assume the other guy knows what I "really" mean when I say something, an assumption that's way too often wrong. \n<blockquote>As for the action conflict.

(The world of IRC gaming being ever time-conscious...) There's a main actor for each side of the conflict, who are the only ones that actually Raise and See. The other characters on either side can only help that main actor via the usual helping dice rule, usually by narrating the helping action and rolling the relevant Traits dice, giving the main actor a maximum of one per helper for each Raise or See. The subsidiary characters can't roll their Attributes, and can only give Relationship dice if they could roll the relationship by the usual rules--that is, if the relationship is at stake or the person is the opposition. <br/><br/>We actually used this rule for the other two conflicts in the session, I don't know why not for the first and main conflict. It certainly would have helped the pacing problem, and given the other players more of a part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
