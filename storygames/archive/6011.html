If you haven't posted already, please consider doing so.)<br/><br/>I'm going to phrase this question to JC directly, but if you have a similar experience or insight, feel free to post as well.<br/><br/>JC, helplessness is definitely a form of terror. Do you get the feeling, though, that when dreading a dice roll you're actually dreading an outcome in a fiction you're immersed in? Or are you dreading the dice roll for the same reason you'd dread the outcome of a dice roll in Monopoly that will likely land your little hat in jail?<br/><br/>In other words, are you feeling dread on a purely system/gamist/"real" level, or do you actually feel some fraction of the burden of the fictional participants in the conflict?<br/><br/>Follow-up question - regardless of your answer - is the dread a "good" kind of dread, where if things turn out not in your favour you still walk away feeling satisfied to have been a part of something pretty scary? Or a "bad" kind of dread where if the dice roll fails, you walk away upset at the outcome? This is, again, a reality/fiction dichotomy, I think: if something bad happens in a horror movie you're watching, it's satisfying. If something bad happens to you in real life, it's not satisfying.<br/><br/>Finally, how do you think the tension of the dice roll terror can be best replicated?

On the fictional level, I was definitely feeling the dread: "I'm probably going to die, and I don't even know if they made it out or not."<br/><br/>On the "real" level, though, I was feeling anything <i>but</i> dread: "My guy's probably going to die! To save his friends! Who don't even know he <i>thinks</i> of them as friends! Awesome!"<br/><br/>Of course, then the GM totally ruined the moment by cheating to keep my character alive, but that's a different issue altogether.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134653/#Comment_134653" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T13:37:04+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  1:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite><br/>Of course, then the GM totally ruined the moment by cheating to keep my character alive, but that's a different issue altogether.</blockquote>\nI beg to differ, Ron, that is <b>not</b> a different issue altogether. It's a great example of how GM fiat kills system-induced feelings of dread in roleplaying games. Imagine if a Call of Cthulhu Keeper had the right to modify any dice roll with impunity, and what that would do to kill the dread in combat encounters or SAN checks.<br/><br/>Very good point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
