Today, during what is normally our Writing time, we gathered on the carpet to tell a story together. I asked the students (18 of them) some questions about who our story would be about, where they lived, what they did, and what the problem would be. I ended up with this scenario:<br/><br/>Marco the school janitor is cleaning up late one night and hears a strange noise in the cafeteria. When he goes to investigate he finds a gigantic green creature slobbering all over the floor and tearing things apart. <br/><br/>Through group voting they decided what Marco would do. For example, I asked them if Marco should A) Try to attack the creature head on or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> sneak away and try to get help. They would vote and which ever was the majority Marco would do. Then I would roll the 6d and use the following table to narrate their success or failure:<br/>1-No and<br/>2-No<br/>3-No But<br/>4-Yes But<br/>5- Yes<br/>6-Yes And<br/><br/>The kids ate it up and once again were cheering like mad when they hit a 6. Marco ended up finding a pocket knife in the things confiscated from students and lured the monster out of the school. An animal patrol officer got eaten, but Marco saved one of the students when the monster tried to sneak in the window of her room. In the end, Marco used the umbrella from some backyard patio furniture to spear the creature and save the neighborhood.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401295/#Comment_401295" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T07:58:11+00:00" title="December 20, 2012  7:58AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
