I'm about equally knowledgeable and vested in each of three hobbies.<br/><br/>My question for those of similar interests, do you facilitate hobby crossover in any ways?  If so, how?<br/><br/>For instance, in our group we used AT-43 minis for our Empire of Dust game.  No modification needed, worked excellent.  <br/><br/>I've also adopted board game rules for RPG mechanics.  In our current steampunk campaign we needed a craft mechanic for a tinkerer PC.  We tried to just use the AW Savvyhead rules but they didn't seem to fit with what our system/campaign demanded.  I conjured up a neat little system based on a deck of cards which was highly influenced by the Merchants and Marauders board game.  Basically use a similar mechanic to Merchant Raids.  This works awesome.<br/><br/>I'm also very interested in how you bring RPG rules to miniature or board games.  The only time I've been successful in doing this was with our classic Car Wars campaign I ran about a year and a half ago.  We played Car Wars rules straight for battles/action and then used Primetime Adventures for everything else.  We had Screen Presence fanmail (which could be spent in the Car Wars battles), etc.  Worked awesome and would love to do it again.  <br/><br/>So what have you done or what ideas do you have?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338489/#Comment_338489" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T15:13:12+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  3:13PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great!

Here are the practical bits.<br/><br/>I realized that miniatures play could be more than just toy soldiers battles or skirmish encounters a la D&amp;D4e set pieces. <br/><br/>World play style games or adventure games with just an initial set up (in terms of both fiction and physical bits, sort of like Jocelyn R's recent thread on creating one shots) were also possible and deeply enjoyable.<br/><br/>The only real tricks to doing those turned out to be;<br/>1) Commit to working largely with what you have physically available, but have a good bit of different stuff available, so that people can ouija board it in the direction it makes most sense as things develop<br/><br/>2) Have non-combatants available, even in an adventurous setting. Just as with some of the more emo-pornoriffic Indie Games, the stories wrapped around the "little people" of the world in strange and trying circumstances can provide vastly interesting stuff to work with.<br/><br/>3)Commit to actually drawing on-the-fly inspiration for fictional stuff from what you see in the physical stuff. If all you notice about that cowboy figure over thataway is that he has a shotgun and you can't think of anything else fictional to wrap around him, you're doing it wrong.<br/><br/>4) Using minis can be distancing, but this can be used to good purpose.<br/><br/>My most successful experiments with stuff like this have been with use of just the core mechanics of the Mythic GM Emulator and attitude stolen from a variety of Indie Games.<br/><br/>I've found that the attitude/philosophy/approach is vastly more important than the mechanical aspects in this kind of play, especially when there isn't a traditional GM or Ref, but more of a First Nerd Among Equals initiating and facilitating play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338572/#Comment_338572" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T08:11:57+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  8:11AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2011 8:12AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>My question for those of similar interests, do you facilitate hobby crossover in any ways?

Players who couldn't compete well with their miniatures on the table remained competitive through manipulation and treachery against the teams around them. <br/><br/>It was a lot of fun and I'd love to do it again.<br/><br/>The new crop of miniatures games could really be used to develop this concept, especially games such as "Malifaux" from Wyrd and "Freebooter's Fate" from Freebooter, since these games allow their players to achieve victory by fulfilling scenario conditions. For example, in Malifaux a player may choose a victory condition from a general set of objectives, from objectives restricted to members of their faction, or even objectives specifically related to the character leading their troops...almost like keys from The Shadow of Yesterday.<br/><br/>It's something I'm toying with and I should have some kind of actual play report in the next few week with all things going well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338702/#Comment_338702" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T08:09:29+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  8:09AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's amazing Michael.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338727/#Comment_338727" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T12:32:44+00:00" title="August 14, 2011 12:32PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several of the RPGs that I have ran lately have had a very board game feel as I go around the table giving each player spot light time and a lot of player scene framing control.

If you won a game, you progressed to the next clue first, while the loser could spend some other form of influence or character interaction to follow along behind these trailblazers. PLayers who ended up too far behind were given the opportunity to jump ahead once one of the shortcuts (lighter arrows) had been passed. This made sure everyone remained competitive in the game even if they lost a string of games, or if real word commitments prevented them from getting to sessions.<br/><br/>Along the way, characters developed, so even though the overall story-line was fairly linear, individual rivalries between team leaders, learned feats and side quests kept up a degree of melodrama and made things interesting. We encouraged people to write up their stories, putting them into a weekly newspaper as a chronicle for the quest. A bit like fan-fic based on the events of the miniatures game, and toward the end of it we tried to create scenarios specifically based on the tales that had been written up about earlier games. <br/><br/>I guess that in the modern storygaming lexicon, this gave us rightward and leftward pointing arrows.<br/><br/>As I said in my earlier post, I'd love to really push the envelope in this direction soon at my local game shop, using the Malifaux miniatures system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338851/#Comment_338851" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T09:15:30+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  9:15AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2011 9:31AM by thadrine.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do this ALL THE TIME.

A game of Shoji where players got moves based upon how well they did in the various scenes of the game and the outcome determined to war that was going on in the background. Unfortunately they were really, really, bad at Shoji. <br/>In other games in the past...<br/>\u2022\tWe used Clue to resolve a murder mystery. <br/>\u2022\tWe used Formula D for a Chariot Race. <br/>\u2022\tWe played a hack of San Juan when they helped a struggling community. <br/>\u2022\tI also layered  Catan tiles over a world map in Photoshop and had them play a couple of rounds of a massive Catan game every session to see how a the economy of their kingdom fared. Difference with this was that when you sent the robber or soldiers you actually played out the scene in the game, and the soldiers were a Miniatures combat game using Hero Scape. <br/>\u2022\tJenga has been used for several different elements and games.  Like points on damage to the ship before it falls, a crumbling tower during a siege, the stock mark in my Monopoly RPG (Yes, we playing an entire rpg around the game Monopoly, each piece had a character sheet with special advantages)<br/>\u2022\tIn a Vampire game one of the players created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk" rel="nofollow">The Turk</a>  that abstracted the plots and schemes of all the major players in the Prince's plans. <br/><br/>I have also done other "Real World" things in my games. <br/>\u2022\tI used an inclined table, marbles, and Jenga blocks as obstacles to represent players trying to roll a large magical apparatus down a stream. <br/>\u2022\tA collapsing airship was becoming unbalanced. So I actually took a large dry erase board balanced on a couple of books and the players had to move weights around it to try and keep it balanced. <br/>\u2022\tFor a modern espionage game I had pre-recorded phone messages, on an auto dialer, that would have the players "Contacts" relay (call their cells) information during to them during, and after, the game. <br/>\u2022\tFor a horror game I had speakers in the other room and a sound effects board on my laptop that made people were ringing the doorbell, hear gunshots, storms, people whispering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338853/#Comment_338853" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T09:21:05+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  9:21AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth is fucking crazy.  <br/><br/>Can you elaborate a little?

I made up a selection of NPC's that players were assigned to play (people that they were already in confidence with). Then each player, and npc, got a selection of cards based upon what they might actually know in character. Players had to successfully convince each other and other NPC's to get them to reveal what they knew, they were not allowed to just each other. It took quite a bit of prep, but it was pretty awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338856/#Comment_338856" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T09:38:39+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  9:38AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that sounds very engaging.
