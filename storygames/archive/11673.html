In that regard, I thought it would be prudent to post our position.<br/><br/><br/>In short, we will not accept submissions of products in PDF format <em>if</em> the product is <em>also</em> available in print/POD format. We will only accept the print/POD (printed out and bound) version.<br/><br/><br/>Our reasons for this stance are thus:\n<ol>\n<li>We're committed to evaluating the products that the public has in their hands and making sure that fans are voting for the same product the judges have nominated. Based upon discussions with publishers, 3.5 products in print have a deeper market penetration than their electronic counterparts and, therefore, would have an unfair advantage amongst voters who would base their votes upon the print version rather than the PDF that was submitted.</li>\n<li>It is more difficult to judge production values in a PDF product versus its printed counterpart. What you see on the screen can look vastly different than what you see in a printed product. In some cases, it can look [I]better[/I] on the screen and might give a publisher an unfair advantage in that regard.</li>\n<li>We cannot, and <em>will not</em>, treat different publishers differently. It is not fair to any publisher to force a larger publisher to send print products and allow a smaller publisher to send PDF only versions of a printed product. All publishers must follow the same guidelines.</li>\n<li>The ENnie Awards is a non-profit entity. A vast majority of our funds come from the silent auction that is held prior to the actual ceremony at GenCon. Most people would be unwilling to bid the same amount for a PDF product than they would a print product. In order to maintain the same standards people expect from the ENnies ceremony, we must raise money somehow and we do not want to shortchange ourselves or the fans.</li>\n</ol>\nPlease remember, if you are a publisher and have electronic versions only of a product, then this does not apply to you. You may continue to submit your products in electronic format using the steps laid out here: <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/publishers/how_to_enter.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ennie-awards.com/publishers/how_to_enter.asp</a><br/><br/><br/>With that said, we welcome feedback and any comments you have on the subject. We only ask that you keep it clean. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><br/>Tony Law<br/><br/>ENnies Assistant Business Manager                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/reveal" title="reveal"><img alt="reveal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/reveal">reveal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260665/#Comment_260665" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T08:34:41+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  8:34AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 8:35AM by reveal.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick clarification: However, if a publisher has a product available in POD format and 1) the POD version has sold less the 50 copies <i>and</i> 2) the PDF and POD versions <i>are exactly identical</i>, then the publisher may submit the PDF version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260680/#Comment_260680" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T09:40:01+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  9:40AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand your stance in some respects, but it does rather strike me that not allowing PDF submissions of print products is also unfair as it skews the results in favour of big companies that can afford to send out multiple copies of a print product, both because they have higher levels of income and because economies of scale make each individual book cheaper for them. I wouldn't expect large and small companies to be subject to different rules and regulations, but I would prefer the playing field to be as level as possible.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a certain degree of self-interest inherent here, since as a small publisher I've never been able to afford to enter the contest. However I doubt that I'm the only person in this position. Similarly, when I write my little review column, I am always happy to accept PDF if the publisher can't afford to send me a print copy.<br/><br/>Also, why should it matter if a print product and a PDF look different, provided that it is clear to the general public which of the two is being submitted to the contest and that it is a version of the product that is on general release? I could understand it if someone submitted, say, a full-colour PDF when the book was only available as a black-and-white PoD, but if the colour version is on sale as a PDF and everyone knows that's what you're reviewing for the competition, where's the harm?<br/><br/>Finally, if the argument of a PDF looking better than a print copy is valid, then I would like to offer the counter-proposal that a print product is instinctively viewed as having more value than a PDF and furthermore is more popular and visible to the game-buying public, thus skewing possible results also.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260741/#Comment_260741" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T12:56:08+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 12:56PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 12:58PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a product has more value, isn't it a bad contest that <i>doesn't</i> skew in its favor?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260748/#Comment_260748" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T13:14:56+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  1:14PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were running the contest, and I'm not, PDFs would be eligible for everything physical books were eligible for, <i>except</i> production awards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260856/#Comment_260856" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T03:48:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  3:48AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2010 3:49AM by Destriarch.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>If a product has more value, isn't it a bad contest that<i>doesn't</i>skew in its favor?</blockquote>\nThat's not quite the point I'm making. The OP asserts that a PDF might look better on the screen than it does in print, and that this would skew the results in favour of a PDF. I argue that, since a book has greater percieved value, the results would skew back in that direction anyway, thus canceling out any apparent advantage that a PDF product might have. In absolute truth though, I think that both should be viewed on their own merits. Why should a good PDF game be disallowed or rendered unenterable through economic factors, just because the publisher also takes the trouble to put it in print?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>If I were running the contest, and I'm not, PDFs would be eligible for everything physical books were eligible for,<i>except</i>production awards.</blockquote>\nI couldn't agree more, assuming that by production awards you mean awards that are purely due to the printed quality - PDFs have production values too, they just have different requirements to a print product. The usual problem for the publisher when printing a book is in adjusting for contrast, brightness and intensity so that the printed version of the book is easily viewable and doesn't lose too many of the subtleties in the art. That's why it's so important to proof a copy. Most everything else will depend on the choice of printer / binder as, since Mongoose abandoned their equipment, I don't think any RPG companies have in-house printing any more.<br/><br/>Makes you wonder actually if print quality awards shouldn't go to the printer rather than the publisher.<br/><br/>Personally I think the ideal situation would be to have different categories for printed material and PDFs, at least in the major awards.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
