I'd actually been hoping for a couple more, but we had some cancellations, so there were only three of us: me, my partner Neil and our friend Dan.<br/><br/>By coincidence, this was precisely the same group that had tried out Moldvay Red Box months ago when we dug up Neil's brother's copy, so I explained the system as trying to be akin to RB insofar as a quick setup and getting Straight to The Adventure, but hopefully with some more interesting tactical opportunities when it came to conflict.<br/><br/>Neil and Dan, never able to take the straight path anywhere, immediately came up with a pair of utter bastards for their characters: a necromancer who posed as a pious priest and his semi-indentured servant, a ranger/assassin who was following only until the necromancer could get powerful enough to raise his dead love.<br/><br/>Character creation was pretty straightforward and I was pretty lienient in what I allowed as skills.  Neil ended up with spells like "Create Zombie" that was basically his Fight skill in almost every battle.  He either had one trailing behind them, or raised one to fight for him (several of the battles conviently happening in graveyards or temples and ruins full of corpses).  He could also wither limbs and cause pain ("Wrack") and he actually ended up having a Heal spell for when his 'priestly' duties called for it.  He could also talk to the dead via his Seance skill. Dan's character had Sneak, Bluff, and mostly fought with his Bow.<br/><br/>I asked them for a Goal.  They decided the pair was questing for an ancient relic: the mummified hand of a dead Saint, that would give them protection from the undead and the ability to nullify the abilties of the rest of the necromancer's circle, giving them a distinct advantage.<br/><br/>Neil and I had drawn up a map during the Red Box Hack game we'd played, and we decided to use it for this.  I'd placed a small village called Two Oaks in the center and far to the east, beyond the mountains, was the Lake of Ash.  We set the temple on its shores.<br/><br/>The party started out in Two Oaks, and immediately decided to try gaining Advantage there, using the town as a base.  They'd convince the yokels that they were on a holy pilgrimage and get supplies and help.<br/><br/>Neil tried locating and impressing the local religious figure.  He failed.  I immediately took the Advantage and created an opponent -- Father Fenrik, who didn't think much of the new arrivals.<br/><br/>Dan tried gaining some Advantage at the pub while Neil went to the graveyard to find some useful information from the local dead.  Neil did well on his roll, Dan failed.  He ended up pissing off some of the local drunken farmers.  Rather than fight them in the bar, he ran.<br/><br/>It was the first use of the Move maneuver and it went pretty well. Dan succeeded wildly, they failed miserably (Level 2 Farmers).  I told Dan that he could either get away or lead them as he saw fit.  He lead them to the graveyard, where he and his partner proceeded to slaughter them and then, to add insult to injury, make them into zombies to dig their own graves.<br/><br/>They then decided to use the information Neil had gained from his seance to their advantage, shifting popular opinion away from the good Father.  They succeeded and lead the townsfolk to a hidden cache hidden during an earlier time of trouble.  The people were delighted and procured the supplies the party needed, but Father Fenrik remained unimpressed.<br/><br/>The two woke up in the middle of the night to find several burly priests with swords standing over them (failed Observation counter rolls).  They were dragged to the graveyard where the Father stood over the newly dug graves.<br/><br/>Unable to receive a sufficient answer for how this had happened, Fenrik nodded, turned to his men and said "Bury them with the others," before walking off.<br/><br/>This is where we ran into our first problem.  Using the rules as written, I'd created Fenrick and his followers - all Level 4 characters.  Outnumbered two to one and already in a situation which placed them at a disadvantage, the characters were going to get utterly slaughtered.<br/><br/>We talked it over and decided to start over to a certain extent.  I'd reset the Goal and we'd narrate that they'd fought a bit and then ran off, leaving almost everything behind.  We decided to try two new rules: the GM doesn't start with Advantage from a goal based on its difficulty and Advantage can be spent at a rate of 1 point to 2 Levels of opponents.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143046/#Comment_143046" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T08:53:40+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  8:53AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 12:21PM by peccable.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The second rule worked out great.  The first one, not at all.  Without any real way to set up obstacles for the players, they ended up making their own, which was very unsatisfying (the [corrected] Czege Principle in action, ouch).  This part of the game got a little muddled, but once the Advantage started flowing again, we were on out way.  I've come to the conclusion that I'll stick with the Difficulty = Initial GM Advantage rule as written, but change the cost for opponents.<br/><br/>The party made their way across the mountains to Halfway, an old mining town set in the mountains between Two Oaks and the Lake of Ash.  Halfway used to be prosperous, before the local silver mine died out.  Neil had the idea of using his Wrack spell to hurt some of the locals and then arrive to heal them.  Dan noted that some of them were already sick and that they could just cure a couple of them.<br/><br/>"That could work too," said Neil.<br/><br/>They plied their trade here with much greater success, saving Silas the local shopkeeper from illness and getting supplies and his son Fredrick as a guide in exchange. <br/><br/>Neil tried gaining Advantage on the way by using his Seance skill to contact one of the dead priests from the abandoned temple.  He failed miserably.  We narrated that his body went into convulsions as his soul was dragged down to the Ninth Circle of Hell (on the way down he actually caught sight of the three farmers they'd murdered). Dan's attempts to explain Neil's actions to Fredrick were fun.  Neil ended up talking with the last priest of the temple (Cornelius), who lied through his teeth, leading Neil to believe that he'd been a pious man to the end and had been betrayed by his fellows.  Neil managed to get a couple of useful tidbits out of the torrent of lies, but we narrated that the information ended up hurting him more than helping him (represented by the GM gaining Advantage).  Neil returned with tales of the utter evil that had taken over the temple.  <br/><br/>The party decided utter evil was right up their alley and proceeded.<br/><br/>Further along the approach, Dan maneuverd a Gain Advantage using his Scouting skill.  Succeeding, he narrated seeing a glowing angelic figure near the temple.  "Are you quite sure it was utter EVIL?" he asked the necromancer.<br/><br/>I used some of the accumulated Advantage to create a set of Level 1 Cherubim (which I described as looking like the "singular plural" cherubim from "A Wind in the Door") to harass them, using the 1 Advantage = 2 Levels of Opponents rule.  This ended up working *much* better, as did the combat count rule (the cherubim harassing them for three turns and then fleeing before they were killed).<br/><br/>They went through several encounters in the temple, including a falling stone trap that I created using the Create Trigger maneuver.  In the end, after being attacked again by groups of Cherubim, the party decided to put it all out on the table.  Neil dressed Dan up as a priest (Gain Advantage using his skills) and then Dan went and found the angel and proclaimed that they were on a holy pilgrimage to see the icon (Advance, using Bluff).<br/><br/>It was here that Neil came up with the idea of spending Advantage purely for a mechanical Advantage.  I agreed to let them spend up to 3 Advantage to gain up to +3 towards their effective skill for a roll (much the way Skill Damage already worked).  It worked great -- the party could invest more Advantage in rolls they took more seriously.  They ended up succeeding wildly on both rolls.  I narrated that the angel (named Koriel) looked rather skeptical, but lead the "initiate" back to the room that housed the relic.<br/><br/>At this point they just shoved the stupid angel out of the way, grabbed the hand and tried running for it.<br/><br/>The whole adventure ended with a massive battle against Koriel and his Cherubim and was basically decided by Neil melting off Koriel's face (Skill Damage against his Personality, to prevent his using his Inspire skill to help the Cherubim).  Dan spent the last of their Advantage on an Advance (the final point they needed) to Bluff the angel into backing off.  Koriel let them go, but cursed them, vowing revenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143047/#Comment_143047" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T08:54:48+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  8:54AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 9:03AM by peccable.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having achieved their goal, Dan immediately asked if we could play another adventure.  We realized that we'd only been playing about 2 hours, and set up another 8 point goal: carrying the hand and a willing sacrifice to the Broken Towers (in the forests west of Two Oaks) where they could transfer its power to Neil's character.<br/>The willing sacrifice was the tough part -- Neil and Dan decided that they just couldn't drag someone off.<br/><br/>They arrived back in Halfway and tried fleecing the locals again.  However, the angel's curse must of held because things went horribly.  Fredrick had returned to his family with weird stories about the "pilgrims" and Silas would have nothing more to do with Dan.  In the meantime, Neil managed to accidentally kill someone he was trying to heal.  The sequence ended with the Neil fleeing from an angry mob towards Dan who was standing on the outskirts of town with their horses.<br/><br/>I used some of the Advantage I'd gained through this to throw a set of Dracoids (dinosaur-looking Kobold-like creatures we'd invented during our Red Box Hack game) at them as they fled across the fields beyond the mountains.  They handled them well, clearly getting used to the combat system.  Neil, for example, immediately started directing Dan on when they should try Skill versus Kill Damage attacks and when one was more useful than the other.<br/><br/>It was during this fight that they both noticed that fights tended to be all or nothing -- either they were barely holding on for dear life or they felt like there was no way they could lose.  We talked it over and decided that we'd try a new rule variant: Advantage would be gained for the difference in skill level between sides only once at the start of the battle.  This ended up working much better, with more balanced battles that still contained swings in Advantage.<br/><br/>They left the last Dracoid alive and Dan used his Bluff skill with an Advance maneuver to convince the thing that by coming with them and sacrificing itself at the Broken Towers it would be saving its village.<br/><br/>The Dracoid lead them north of Two Oaks through the forest towards the towers.  On the way, they were harassed again by Cherubim.  After killing them off, Dan announced that he was going to try drawing blood from one of them and asked Neil if he could somehow use it to enhance his weapons.  Neil spent some of the Advantage they gained from winning the fight to do a Find Maneuver to dip one of Dan's arrows in the blood, which could then be used to gain 3 Advantage during a fight against a supernatural creature.  It was the first time we'd used the Create Item rules and it seemed to work well: open enough that it could support anything Dan wanted to do, but specific enough with regards to cost.<br/><br/>They eventually reached the Towers and I threw a couple of other obstacles in their way including a neat little sequence where they had to climb one tower and then cross its broken top, which leaned against the tower they were trying to reach.<br/><br/>They found the chamber they needed at the top of the tallest tower.  As they entered, Neil noticed something moving out of the corner of his eye -- there was a figure in one of the mirrored walls of the room that he recognized: Cornelius, the dead priest of the temple he'd spoken to.  Dan noticed another figure in the opposing mirror: the melted skull/face of Koriel.<br/><br/>The final battle involved the ghost of Cornelius, the half-deformed Koriel, and a small fleet of Cherubim against Neil and Dan.  This was probably the best battle of the whole game.<br/><br/>At one point, the ghost of Cornelius tried a big move - a Kill Damage Area of Effect Lightning spell risking 6 Advantage.  He failed the roll.   It was the turning point of the battle.  Having such a huge influx of Advantage, the players went crazy on the Angel with Skill Damage attacks, completely taking him out of battle with regards to his Muscle and Agility (until he could no longer effectively use his flaming sword or golden net), which means he basically had to fly back and Intimidate them while trying to heal. <br/><br/>The party ended up killing the angel and then shattering the mirror that Cornelius had emerged from.  Dan narrated that he picked up a piece of the mirror and they could see Cornelius's face looking out, yelling at them.  He planned on using it with a Find maneuver next adventure.<br/><br/>We ended with Neil completing the ritual and gaining the power of the hand as the Dracoid killed himself with Koriel's flaming sword.  I narrated that after it died, it suddenly stood again, wings shooting out of its back.  It grabbed the flaming sword, looked at them both for a moment, and then shot out of the broken top of the tower.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143049/#Comment_143049" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T08:56:59+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  8:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 12:22PM by peccable.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And that's where we stopped for the night, about 3 1/2 hours after we'd started.  Dan noted that their next adventure (one more 8 point goal would get them a level up) would probably involve going back to Two Oaks and kicking Father Fredrick's butt, but that would have to wait for another time.<br/><br/>And that was it.  I think everyone had a lot of fun and while there were problems with some of the specifics (usually involving cost), as a whole the system seemed to hold together pretty darn well.<br/><br/>The conclusions we came to:<br/><br/>* The obstacle rules as written were totally unbalanced.  1 point for a character equal to a single party member can allow the GM to utterly decimate the party early on.  We ended up switching it to "1 point = 2 Levels of obstacle". Thus, 2 points could make a Level 4 opponent, or 4 Level 1 opponents, or 2 Level 2 opponents, etc. <br/><br/>* Advantage points given to the GM as the start of a Goal should be spent immediately to set up initial obstacles for the adventure -- to give the players some framework to move within.  Without this step, the players end up coming up with their own obstacles and solutions just to generate Advantage.  As a real-life example of the [corrected] Czege Principle in action, this definitely did not work.<br/><br/>* Neil asked during an important roll if he could spend Advantage outright to get a plus on the roll, much the way Skill Damage works. It made sense to me, so I ruled you could spend additional Advantage to a maneuver to add up to +3 to your effective skill for the roll. We used that rule for the remainder of the game and it seemed to really work well.<br/><br/>* There was a definite cycle where those who started out on top stayed on top in the first couple of battles.  We decided to try out a new rule: Advantage was only gained for skill differences at the *start* of a fight.  This ended up working pretty well, as it allowed much more flow in the battle in who seemed to be winning.  It also made the down time between turns even smaller.<br/><br/>I felt that, with the changes we made, the system worked well.  The later battles we ran went quickly and yet were narratively and mechanically interesting.  I really liked when Cornelius' big move failed and it shifted the whole battle against them.<br/><br/>I feel like with these changes, the system has some stability.  It'll definitely require a lot more testing to get a feel of how the costs work (particularly for the Find and Create Trigger maneuvers which weren't used a lot) as well as how the whole thing scales to higher levels.  <br/><br/>Thanks again to anyone who chimed in with their comments.  If anyone ends up testing the system, I highly suggest the above modifications (I'll have to get a version 0.0.4 out).  If you do, please let me know!<br/><br/>Thanks again!<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143073/#Comment_143073" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T11:07:40+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 11:07AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 11:09AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds great!

I blame this on work.  In any case, our mutual friend Dan (confusing, I know) did grab a copy of Riskbreaker and brought it over my place last night.  We got into a good, chunky three hour playtest of the game, some one-on-one stuff.  I'm afraid that I'm not terribly conversant in the system's language so I'm not so sure that my observations would be all that helpful.  Still, I'll reproduce some of my notes from that session here and maybe you'll find them helpful.  <br/><br/><b>Different Combat Types</b><br/>In our game we would often get into social combats.  I spent a lot of time trying to convince other characters of the greatness of my own, Sir Geralt Devonshire.  We wound up treating these just like regular combats but with no long-lasting repercussions (i.e.: death).  We also got into plenty of regular old combats when NPCs didn't recognize how great Sir Geralt actually was.  Through these combats I noted that it wasn't terribly useful to just go for a regular attack.  Skill damage was so much more useful.  It decreases your opponent's ability to attack you and, if enough skill damage is done, removes him from the fight entirely.  Also, it's easier to do a skill attack than it is a regular one.  The presence of both killing damage and skill damage felt redundant.  <br/><br/><b>Whiff Factor</b><br/>Sir Geralt, despite being the greatest Knight of the entire land, failed.  A lot.  My strongest attribute, which was above average, was a five.  Meaning that should I be attacking someone with my sword skill I have only a fifty percent chance of succeeding on every attempt.  My other attributes put me at either a forty or thirty percent chance of being successful.  Because of the nature of the system each roll is isolated, meaning that further attempts at finding success do not actually increase my chance of success at all.  Dan had the same problem.  We would spend fifteen minutes or more on some conflicts simply exchanging our Advantage tokens back and forth between each other as we went back and forth failing our rolls.  <br/><br/>We wound up resolving this at our table by changing the type of dice we were using.  We switched the dice types from d10s over to three fudge dice that we used to modify our attribute scores in an attempt to hit a constant target of five.  When we did this conflicts moved much, much faster and felt more satisfying.  We also said that using an appropriate skill gave you one bonus dice, a la Shadow of Yesterday.  <br/><br/><b>Mooks</b><br/>Dan wanted mooks.  He just wanted little guys that worked together and equalled out to a level two or four opponent.  Just a notice of something you might want to think of including.  Or do you think mooks don't fit?<br/><br/>Also, just a note from another playtesting guy, you should boil up character sheets that have all of the relevant abilities and combat options that the players have on them.  During our game I would often ask Dan what I was capable of doing, and then ask him the same question twenty minutes later.  The tactical abilities in the game are really interesting, but I wanted an easy way to reference them.  Considering the tiny footprint of the character information (which is awesome) you could really cram a lot of information about those tactical options on to a character sheet with no problem.  <br/><br/>I really do hope that this was helpful, Peccable.  I really liked the experience we had playing, though it did have the occasional hiccup.  Mind you, those might have come up simply because we were playing the game incorrectly.  I think Dan might come along later and bring more mechanical information from the session to be mulled over.  Also, and obviously, I'd be hapy to answer any questions you might have about our session.  <br/><br/>-m                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143276/#Comment_143276" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T08:13:27+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  8:13AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2008 8:15AM by peccable.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MPOSullivan</cite>We got into a good, chunky three hour playtest of the game, some one-on-one stuff.</blockquote>\nHoly wow!  I knew Dan talked about playing it sometime, but I didn't realize he meant quite so quickly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks for the notes.  I'll try taking each point separately.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MPOSullivan</cite></blockquote>In our game we would often get into social combats. I spent a lot of time trying to convince other characters of the greatness of my own, Sir Geralt Devonshire. We wound up treating these just like regular combats but with no long-lasting repercussions (i.e.: death).<br/>Perfectly valid.  The playtest version has an extended example where the "combat" is a legal case -- the first person to take Killing damage equal to their Law skill/stat loses.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MPOSullivan</cite>We also got into plenty of regular old combats when NPCs didn't recognize how great Sir Geralt actually was. Through these combats I noted that it wasn't terribly useful to just go for a regular attack. Skill damage was so much more useful. It decreases your opponent's ability to attack you and, if enough skill damage is done, removes him from the fight entirely. Also, it's easier to do a skill attack than it is a regular one. The presence of both killing damage and skill damage felt redundant.</blockquote>\nI think there was some confusion over the rules here.  In all honesty, the current version isn't entirely clear on some points, so I take responsibility for that.<br/><br/>The first point is that skill damage will never actually remove anyone from a fight.  They might be too exhausted to hit you at the moment, but if they can get some distance away from you for a single turn, they can pull a Recover maneuver and immediately gain back up to 3 points of skill damage.  Also, skill damage is spread over particular stats, so if you have skills in other stats, you can still always use those.<br/><br/>We found it was really useful not to put all your eggs in one basket because of this.  The angel Dan and Neil fought had both a Muscle and an Agility weapon and could switch as needed.  Plus he had skills like Inspire and Intimidate that he could use during a Recovery manuever.<br/><br/>If by "removes him from the fight entirely" you meant "makes him unable to do much" that is true, but as I noted, it shouldn't be too hard to try recovering.  If both sides are inflicting Skill damage, they're both trying to get to a situation where they can recover, anyway.<br/><br/>Skill damage is definitely easier to inflict, but it's also easier to recover from.  Does it seem *too* easy to inflict, though?<br/><br/>Neil also pointed out that if the above is true, all you really need to do is do Skill Damage on someone's Agility first so they can't run away, then pummel them until they're impotent, and then kill them.<br/><br/>Which actually doesn't sound like a bad tactic in real life, but if it's the only way to play the game, that doesn't really work, does it?<br/><br/>A possible solution is to remove the need to be out of battle for the Recover Maneuver - that way you can trade in a direct action to gain advantage or hurt the enemy to heal yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143277/#Comment_143277" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T08:14:00+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  8:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MPOSullivan</cite>Sir Geralt, despite being the greatest Knight of the entire land, failed.

They're Level 1, starting with 20 points (10*1 + 10).<br/><br/>They should probably fight in groups, with a leader doing the rolls for them (acting as a group -- as noted in the Risk spending rules).

How about if they manage this, they get a double recovery. But if they recover during the fight, they simply get a normal recovery, forfeiting their attack? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about 1 recovered in the fight, and 3 outside. This makes the running away an investment that pays off, if successful. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's interesting is that both sides might choose to recover inside the fight, and then you get the cool narration of circling each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads me to an observation about recovery. I always hate it when I am penalized in recovery for having high levels of ability. Why does a "Cure Light Wounds" help that first level guy proportionally so much more than me when I'm tenth level? Balance? OK, but it doesn't make a lot of sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about if you recover in the fight, you get back up to 3 or your level of ability -2, whichever is lower. If you recover outside of a fight, you recover up to full, whatever that may be. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, if that seems too fast, you can do a "long-term" skill damage rule that says that the character can only recover up to their level of ability -1 at best when in a fight, and up to full when taking a full recovery? Just some ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally speaking, how much lattitude to characters have in ability use, and changing them? What if, instead of resting, while I'm circling you, I'm actually using my tactics skill to try to find an opening (represented by advantage shift)? What if, my agility having been reduced to nothing, I decided to fall back on trying to convince my opponents that they ought to join my side!<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you switch tactics in a fight, such that you can use other stats? If so, then the skill damage becomes more pressurizing, and less a winning move. Maybe I can prevent physical harm, but then I might be subject to being convinced to stop attacking with words? <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a player can spend advantage to get into a new arena? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not seeing how Michael's use of FUDGE dice solved his problem... didn't he still whif close to 50% of the time? (The bell curve on fudge dice only slants things slightly to zero in the overall curve). In any case, a rough, but simple solution to this, is to roll two dice, and take the lowest. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven better might be to use dice pools.

As my partner pointed out, in the rules as written combining Agility Skill Damage with any other kind can basically wipe out your effectiveness, since you can't fight back and you can't run away to recover.<br/><br/>I've decided that in the new playtest version, I'm going to simply allow Recover to be used while you're still in combat.  I'd still say that Rescue (Killing Damage heal) requires being out of combat, though.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>What's interesting is that both sides might choose to recover inside the fight, and then you get the cool narration of circling each other.</blockquote>\nRight.  You've both given up a maneuver to recover.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>This leads me to an observation about recovery.

One possibility I'm playing with is that you can heal up to half your current damage in an ability while in a fight and full if you manage to get away for a moment.<br/><br/>I don't think this is totally unbalancing, either, since you can only heal in one stat at a time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Generally speaking, how much lattitude to characters have in ability use, and changing them?

If you choose not to take that additional maneuver, you heal 1 extra point.<br/><br/>Actually, now that I think about it, that rule doesn't quite work.  The bolded part should read "using a Stat other than the one you're healing."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>What if, my agility having been reduced to nothing, I decided to fall back on trying to convince my opponents that they ought to join my side!</blockquote>\nIt's always an option.  During our playtest, Dan's "killing" move against the Angel was, in fact, a Bluff.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Can you switch tactics in a fight, such that you can use other stats? If so, then the skill damage becomes more pressurizing, and less a winning move. Maybe I can prevent physical harm, but then I might be subject to being convinced to stop attacking with words?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely you can switch tactics.  It was the only way at certain points that Koriel stayed in the fight.  They took out his Muscle and his Agility so he could use neither his net nor his sword, so he pulled back and Recovered while using Inspire and Intimidate (his Personality hadn't been hit...that is, until Neil melted his face off).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I'm not seeing how Michael's use of FUDGE dice solved his problem... didn't he still whif close to 50% of the time?

Did the dice change help at all?<br/><br/>Regarding percentages, as I said, it seemed "right" to me that a total Level 4 Adventurer Noob has a 50% chance to succeed using his/her strongest skill.

Basically every character gets to recover one stat (at half or whatever) each turn, so long as he's not currently using it?</blockquote>\nThat's the practical upshot of the rule, yes.  You do a Recover maneuver, and declare a supplementary maneuver that's not in the stat that you're healing.  You get back half of the damage done to that stat.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>That seems elegant. How about the player can forgo the roll, and get a full recovery of one stat? The half-recovery only occurs if the character also does something else.</blockquote>\nCurrently as written you get +1, but going full-heal sounds fairer and more interesting.<br/><br/>As a note on balacing and cost: inflicting damage of any kind costs Advantage and an action.  Healing Skill damage costs no Advantage, and possibly not even an action (in this new version).  Healing Kill damage costs both.  That seems to work for me: there's a point of diminishing returns on inflicting Skill damage, since your opponent can heal while still fighting you (though they may be favoring stats that aren't their strongest).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Yes, definitely killing damage needs to have the character out of conflict to resolve. This is to make it a more important goal. But I fear that it makes stat damage too weak.</blockquote>\nI don't think so.  I'll have to test it, but lowering stats make those opponents necessarily slower (since initiative is based on the stat you're using).  Hit them with skill damage in one round, slow them down and then set them up for killing damage the next.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Again, what if you have long-term and short-term stat damage? That is, whenever you recover in a fight, you can only at best recover up to stat -1 (that one irreparable point representing longer lasting effects of the damage). To get back that last point, like healing killing damage, you have to get out of the conflict, and have some ability that can take care of that damage.</blockquote>\nThat's kind of how it works now.  Since Rescue has to be done out of conflict, and costs Advantage (I just noticed it's not this way in 0.0.3, but it's how we played it and it works), it becomes an interesting choice: do we wait and heal up for do we press forward?  The first choice saves Advantage and saves you a roll that might give even more Advantage to the GM.  The second choice is 'safer' in the near-term, but in the long term can give the other side more power to use against you.<br/><br/>It sounds like exactly the sort of choices I wanted a party playing Riskbreaker to face.<br/><br/>In your example, you're expanding it to Skill damage, but since (as written) such damage doesn't cost advantage, the idea of 'long term' skill damage doesn't really work.  I could, of course, change the rules to support this, but I think having to stop and heal Kill damage seems enough.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>The issue now with "switching tactics" is that as you have it... is there ever any reason for a character to use anything but his highest ability? Is there any penalty for using words in a sword-fight? Or for trying to use a sword in an debate? Are certain goals only achievable with certain abities?</blockquote>\nWell, an obvious reason not to use your highest ability is that it's been hit with Skill Damage such that it's no longer your highest ability. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Another is that skill/stat use has narrative consequences, at least that's how I play it.  Pulling out a sword on your opponent during an empassioned debate in front of the emperor is much more likely to land you in the dungeons than sway the court.<br/><br/>Also, in the end, it leads to more interesting play, which is worth a bit of min-maxing in my opinion.  Dan using his Bluff skill because he was good at it to finish off the adventure was fine.  On top of this, I got to keep Koriel alive for the next adventure.<br/><br/>Also, certain goals are absolutely only achieveable with certain abilities.  I tend to be pretty open, but if a player's trying to use their Bluff skill in a sword fight to inflict Kill damage ("I utterly crush his self-esteem!"), I'm probably going to say "Uhm, no."<br/><br/>I've been making a list from this thread of changes I need to make for 0.0.4.
