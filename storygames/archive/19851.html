This game is designed to be run by a teacher/adult for a group of children Age 9-13.<br/><br/>The major premise for the game is that there is a secret world of magic that is hidden to the majority of people similar to something like Harry Potter. The Game Master, called 'The Tutor', acts as though they are an agent from the government, sent to scout out those who can become magicians. The children players are told that they show the potential, but before being indoctrinated to the world of magic they must prove that they have what it takes to be a Witch/Wizard.<br/><br/>This is where the RPG aspect comes in.  The children fill out a short a short personality test which determines their affinities to the different schools of magic, Character's base attributes, as well as grants them one of 4 special abilities. Characters within the game are mental projections of the players themselves, meaning they look and act just like the players but with the ability to cast spells. Within each session the players will be tasked with working together to overcome challenges. <br/><br/>Characters grow and develop from in session actions, but I want the acquisition of new spells to be something the players have to do outside the game. I would like to have the kids go off on their own and learn something they may not have learned in school. <br/><br/>Ex. If you want to learn the spell <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/colorSpray.htm" rel="nofollow">'Color Spray'</a> you may have to learn about the dispersion of light.<br/><br/><b>But here in lies my problem, how do I measure such tasks? how do I phrase these assignments to be interesting, and balanced?</b><br/><br/>I have been looking at this problem for the past little while, but I haven't found any way to make these extra assignments as unobtrusive as possible. any ideas?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for the help!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439929/#Comment_439929" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T23:43:07+00:00" title="November  4, 2014 11:43PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great idea.<br/><br/>Here's my first reaction:<br/><br/>If the children are going out to collect information on whatever it is they want magical powers for, make the resulting powers based on the information they bring back.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>Version 1<br/><br/>There's a spell called "Color Spray". To learn it, the player must go read about the dispersion of light. Then s/he comes back to you and must somehow demonstrate their knowledge, which you must "rate" so you can decide whether it's "good enough" for the spell.<br/><br/>That sounds like what you're suggesting. This is awkward, and no fun!<br/><br/>So I would go with something the other way around:<br/><br/>Version 2<br/><br/>Player says what subject they are researching (e.g. the dispersion of light), then goes to collect information, and brings it back to you in whatever fashion they like. <br/><br/>You, then, either create or find a spell/power based on the information they brought back. <br/><br/>The player gets a spell no matter what... but the power and type of the spell or power depends on the information they find.<br/><br/>The more thorough the information, the more stuff they find, the more versatile or powerful the spells they will gain access to. <br/><br/>Someone just looking up how the dispersion of light works might get a "Light" spell.<br/><br/>Someone who studies prisms, diffraction, different spectra, etc., might get a spell which can create light of any colour (including outside the visible spectrum, if they learned about that concept!), and it returns information back to them about whatever it's striking (maybe the kid read up on "spectral analysis", so you need to reflect this in the spell or power).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L" title="Patrick_L"><img alt="Patrick_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/999/nLXZTS67FSGIK.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L">Patrick_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439933/#Comment_439933" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T00:03:36+00:00" title="November  5, 2014 12:03AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like where you are coming from Paul.

They'll be able to see cause and effect: "I researched THIS and I got THAT spell. Next time I should find out more about this-or-that."<br/><br/>As for the Napoleonic war problem, yeah, ask the kid.<br/><br/>But it might be good to get on the same page *before* the research happens. You don't want kids bringing in random trivia, after all, and then trying to fit it into the game.<br/><br/>Ideally, I'd say, there's a fictional problem that the character is facing, and they want to develop a tool which helps them solve it. That suggests something from them to research - and you turn it into a spell. <br/><br/>If they don't like something about a spell, you can make recommendations for further research - "If you want to be able to float while doing this <i>as well</i>, you're going to have to find out something about how living creatures that are light enough to fly or glide are constructed! Otherwise your mage won't know how to weave the dweomers right..."<br/><br/>Kid: "I want to summon the spirit of the dead?"<br/>You: "What kind of spirit? The more you know about the people you're trying to summon, the easier it will be - their languages, customs, what they cared about... all that information makes it easier to summon the dead!"<br/><br/>If you have trouble being "impartial", you could make some kind of roll or oracle for yourself when crafting the spells for the kids:<br/><br/>* Unusually good result: the spell is extremely useful, powerful, long-lasting<br/>* Mediocre result: the spell does something unusual, but not immediately apparent what it's for... it's up to you to figure out how to make it useful!<br/>* If the number rolled was odd, the spell has an unusual side effect<br/>etc.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FableForge" title="FableForge"><img alt="FableForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/648/nXJ4O51HY3RHE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FableForge">FableForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440020/#Comment_440020" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-08T03:41:35+00:00" title="November  8, 2014  3:41AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to volunteer a system called DESTINY which seems like it might help.

Here is what I am planning on going with, let me know what you think.<br/><br/>Since characters in the game are mental projections of the player, they have skills and abilities appropriate to what the player knows about. These are called Understandings. These Understandings act as both the characters skill list, and spell focus list. Whenever a character tries to perform an action or cast a spell, they can tag an appropriate Understanding to gain a bonus to performing that action.<br/><br/>Ex. Billy collects bugs, so his character has an understanding of "Insects". He can call upon this bonus any time its appropriate.<br/><br/>-summoning a swarm of bees<br/>-learning facts about a bug in the game world<br/>-sprouting bug wings, allowing his character to fly<br/><br/>at the end of a session, the players either state a topic they wish to explore or an understanding the which they want. The GM and the player then agree on the name of the understanding the character will receive for learning about the topic (the GM can also give the player some topics to start researching from). This way the player and the GM know what the in game implications will be. Players can also choose to explore an understanding they already have, in order to gain more ranks in it.<br/><br/>At the start of the next session, players will then share what they learned. Sharing anything relevant to the agreed topic will grant you one rank in that understanding.<br/><br/>Once everyone has gone around the table and shared what they learned. they players then vote for who brought the most interesting piece of knowledge (they can't vote for themselves). For each vote you receive, you get an in game currency similar to fate or hero points. <br/><br/>If every player at least brings one piece of information, then the whole group gets additional Fate/Hero points.<br/><br/>The game is still in its early stages and I would love some feedback on this, so let me know what you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
