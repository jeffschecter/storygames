Are you familiar with Game Chef or 24-Hour RPG or The Ronnies (which is a sort of combination of both of the latter) or any of the other specific themed game design contests. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese have created some of the coolest new games out there. Both of Gregor Hutton's "Best Friends" and "3:16" came out of The Ronnies, for example, so I think they're a great idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nDid you have something specific in mind? Were you asking just to see if anything like this has been done?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179278/#Comment_179278" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T04:26:38+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  4:26AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, back before I got swamped with other stuff, I was thinking of sponsoring NagaGamera: the National Game Gaming Rampage!  I even had a mascot picked out in the form of <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/a-note-to-myself/" rel="nofollow">Garasharp</a>, a giant snake (naga) from the tragically unmade kaiju film <i>Gamera vs. Garasharp</i>.  I would definitely be willing to design a hot Garasharp-inspired logo for anyone thinking of putting something like this together.  Game design contests are one thing, but a game writing contest would be another.  Putting together a playtest draft of something would definitely be a worthy endeavor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/glshade" title="glshade"><img alt="glshade" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/glshade">glshade</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179389/#Comment_179389" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T17:52:10+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  5:52PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops - I forgot game chef......<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that with nanowrimo the open admission your first draft is allowed to suck&gt; I have never gotten a writing project beyong the first 5000 words and with nano I am almost at 30,000 right now, sur lots of it is crap and my story has changed since its beginning so the structure would be different but the intent would be to create a playable game over the corse of a month - I dont recall the elements of game chef.....if I recall right there are elements that you need to include so maybe what I am thinking of overlaps but.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI think haveing  bunch of people creating a game in a do what you want digg might get more people to actually get in and try to make a game that has been lurking in their minds. <br/>\n<br/>\nanyway I have more words to write tonight - --- - who knows maybe I'll turn that sucky novel into a game setting....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179394/#Comment_179394" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T19:55:52+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  7:55PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although the design challenges with various constraints definitely have their place, I do like the idea of doing at thing more like NaNoWriMo, which is basically intended to just get you to write a lot, with no evaluation of the content.
