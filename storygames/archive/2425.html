                    Do you use gender neutral language in your RPG text?<br/>
<br/>
If yes, how?<br/>
<br/>
Say someone wrote: "I wonder who my GM at the con will be. I hope he is friendly."<br/>
<br/>
Methods I've seen to make "he" gender neutral in this example:<br/>
1. "I wonder who my GM at the con will be. I hope the GM is friendly."<br/>
2. "I wonder who my GM at the con will be. I hope he or she is friendly."<br/>
3. "I wonder who my GM at the con will be. I hope they are friendly."<br/>
4. "I wonder who my GM at the con will be. Whom I hope is friendly."<br/>
<br/>
I generally prefer <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, using "they", as it sounds very natural and not as wordy as "he or she". But many people consider this improper as GM is singular and "they" is plural.<br/>
<br/>
What do you prefer?<br/>
<br/>
Edit: fixed the mistake of joining two independent clauses together with a comma. Rock, Larry.                </div>

                            I alternate using "he" or "she" pretty randomly (though always consistent within a given reference to a hypothetical person).  I figure half my hypothetical population is male and half is female.                        </div>

<p>I often don't, depending on the context the game gives. If I recall correctly, <em>Snow From Korea,</em> being about samurai, tends to use the male pronous, while <em>Mridangam</em>'s hypothetical players are dancing girls, so it addresses them as women.</p>

Some gaming texts have adopted the convention of simply alternating from masculine to feminine pronouns between paragraphs, or similarly, arbitrarily assigning feminine pronouns to "the GM" and masculine pronouns to "the players."

                            I'm not a game designer, merely a GM, but I often use "s/he" (sorry, Larry) or alternate between pronoun choices.  When reading an RPG book, I prefer alternance, or a convention as that described by John Stavropoulos ("she refers to the GM and he refers to the players.")  I definitely twitch, nowadays when reading texts (not just RPGs) written entirely in the masculine, unless there's a contextual reason.  <br/><br/>Interesting note: RPGs gave me the habit and comfort of alternace between gender pronouns.  The first time I saw it (I think it was in <i>Vampire</i>), it took me a little bit to get used to it, but now it's my unconscious standard.  So I guess some social progress came from games.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<br/>
The gender-neutral neologism look cool. Although I agree that they would be easier to incorporate into a sci-fi game. Although I think it's cute to use E, Sie, Xe, Ve, Ze, or Zie. Thon sounds weird!<br/>
<br/>
Sophie, right on!<br/>
<br/>
Shreyas, great idea! Just make everything specific when possible.<br/>
<br/>
This probably ties in with the "Cultural Influences on Game Design" thread. Part of why I don't think it sounds funny to use "they" is because in Greek you do use "they" when you want to use gender neutral language or when referring to someone with respect or who is older than you. Ha, I completely forgot about that till now!                        </div>

                            Gender-neutral pronouns are not actually a big deal.  That is, they are really, really easy to avoid.<br><br>Now technically, and as has already been pointed out, using 'he' as the default is correct.  Using 'they' instead is incorrect, and it's not only <em>technically incorrect</em> (with all the prissy and it-doesn't-matter bullshit emphasis you want to put on it), but using 'they' occludes and confuses meaning.  They means more than one person.  Don't use it to mean one person, because readers will get confused and think you mean more than one person.  Not all the time, no, but enough that it's a bad choice when there are much better alternatives.  Alternating pronouns also does this, to a slightly less degree, but has the added bonus of making you sound like a schizophrenic.<br><br>There is a grammatically correct alternative in "one".  As in "One doesn't do such things."  Unfortunately, it's not commonly used or familiar for most audiences, especially in the US.  It's a pity, cause it's the most elegant and hassle-free solution.<br><br>There are gender-neutral neologisms as have already been suggested.  They are less familiar than using "one" and therefore, in my mind, less useful.<br><br>It's relatively trivial, however, to turn around sentence structure so that the default pronoun isn't used.  Instead of, "I wonder who my GM at the con will be, I hope he is friendly." just write, "I wonder if my GM will be friendly."  When you're going the distance, do as Shreyas suggests and just give your hypothetical people names and then use the appropriately gendered pronoun.  And specificity is one of the keys of good writing, anyway.  It's a good habit to, uh, engender.<br/><br/>Then there's the option of intentionally breaking the he-default rule.  If you break a rule unintentionally, it's a mistake; if you break a rule intentionally, it's a statement.  In <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> I assign female pronouns to all ungendered persons of authority.  I don't point it out, I don't screen it with names for the hypothetical people, it's just there and it's a subtle jibe at established gender power structures.<br/><br/>So that's my two cents -- either write so it's not necessary, or make a decision for a reason and stick with it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I use "he or she" usually but "they" sometimes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> points out that although it can be argued as technically incorrect, the use of singular "they" goes back to the 15th century and appears in such writers as Shakespeare, various early Bibles including King James, Thackeray and Jane Austen (though most of the examples can be quibbled with, and are, in the article).<br/><br/>Interestingly it says that in Australia the use of singular "they" is officially sanctioned in government style guides.<br/><br/>I also use "the player" or "the character" in order to avoid the issue.<br/><br/>Neologisms annoy me; I find them distracting and jarring. Sorry, Meguey. But for that matter, alternating "he" and "she" I find distracting and jarring as well.<br/><br/>This is one of those things where any solution you adopt is likely to annoy someone, except possibly Shreyas's one.                        </div>

Great point! Nicely said!

Awesome!!! This fits well with how "they" is used in Greek as well (mentioned above). 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>I also use "the player" or "the character" in order to avoid the issue.</blockquote>
Also a great idea!

                            For the game I'm currently working on, I'm thinking about referring to the GM as "it," but this is for thematic reasons.  The game involves players playing the roles of normal folks who have somehow been "cursed" or "infected" by a great, cosmic Evil.  The GM's primary role is that of "The Evil," so I might use the genderless pronoun to help reinforce that.<br/><br/>But I'm also thinking about separating text regard "the GM" and "the Evil," just as I am about "the players" and the "the PCs."  If I go that approach, I'll probably only leave "it" for when I'm talking about the GM's role as the Evil and instead use "he" for the GM.                        </div>

                            Joshua Bishop Roby, <br/><br/>Standardized spelling and Elements of Style grammar are tiny little blips on the very big radar screen of history. Just because you happen to be correct right here and right now doesn't mean that you are correct for my future self, who has come back in time to tell me that "they" will become correct for referring to one person once our race has evolved enough to recognize that the individual in fact is not, but is in fact a nation state. And they can refer to a nation state. <br/><br/>So there, says my immortal transhuman self from 2463, and he says Shakespeare is back and writing badass brainoperas. <br/><br/>-<br/><br/>My honest answer is: it depends on the book I'm writing. I usually select a gender for example characters or players and use it specifically throughout the example. For example, I often make the GM a female and a player male, and then it becomes obvious when I say "She" I mean "GM" and he is "player." Easy enough, and usually helps contribute to clarity.<br/><br/>The other thing is, I often don't worry about the pronouns so much in terms of gender equality. Honestly, I'll look at them when everything else is done, but because most gaming books are still such gender unequal monuments to boy-hobby, I tend to see the pronouns as the mote rather than the beam.                        </div>

                            More often than not I adopt the convention used (but not very obvious) in Fudge, where players and PCs are referred to with male pronouns and the GM and NPCs go by female pronouns. When I do something different it's because it's specific to the game (e.g., a game where all the PCs are girls) or I'm just not paying attention. ^^;<br/><br/>The gender-neutral neologisms were perfect for Shock:, but in most cases they'd grate.                        </div>

                            As a malicious totally unimportant side-remark: there're languages which don't have this problem due to the simple fact that all the words there have gender. So the "character sheet" is "he" and the "pen" is "she", and you use <i>her </i>to white on <i>him</i>. The "player" is "he". It can lead to constructions like "if he's a girl..." which would sound funny (yet be absolutely grammatically correct).<br/><br/>In forum discussions I tend to use "(s)he" cause it's easy to write and no-one gets offended.

                            "They" will be perfectly clear in context to any modern English speaker. Is it <i>correct</i>? I'm trying to think of a reason to care about that, but I can't come up with one.<br/><br/>I personally try to avoid it, because, yeah, some people will think you're being lazy, and laziness may not be the mood you're trying to evoke. But it's not a big deal. At all.<br/><br/>In Agon, I alternated genders when I felt like it, and used Shreyas's approach otherwise (referring to specific people for examples and such). It worked for me.<br/><br/>I really, really wish that "ze" didn't seem incredibly silly to me. And I mean that. I <i>want</i> to like it, and to incorporate it and make it common.

                            Ahhh, gender neutrality. Let me just say it's harder in some languages than in others. In 'The Shadow of Yesterday', all non-specific characters, players and GMs are female. An exceptions are goblins, who are being polysexual and refered to with the neutral 'it'. Specific characters, players and GMs are consistently male or female. Clinton did some trickery by making the sample characters a strong warrior woman and a love-stricken goblin that gradually transforms into a man because of it's feelings. Lesson: It's not only the language constructs, it's also the contents of the text.<br/>
<br/>
This is something I cannot fully recreate in german language without using some really awkward language constructs. As a compromise, I used 'die Spielfigur' (female) instead of 'der Charakter' (male) throughout the text. For Goblins, I tried to use the plural whereever possible, which uses female articles.<br/>

Not being a professional translator, this gives me quite some headaches at times.                        </div>

                            It's misleading to describe the singular use of they as "incorrect". It's no more incorrect than, say, the Oxford comma (a comma before "and"): some say it's correct, some say it isn't. Merriam-Webster supports the use of the singular "they" and the Oxford English dictionary sits on the fence.<br/><br/>It does give a colloquial, modern English tone to the text, though, and that's not always appropriate.<br/><br/>Oh, John, if we're going into deep grammar, I think all your phrases should start "I wonder <i>whom</i> my GM at the con will be", and the fourth phrase is really quite wrong.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Oh, and Brand's right that it depends what kind of book you're writing. "They" gives a modern tone:<br/><br/><i>"The Active Player plays a card. They then narrate an advantage to their character."</i><br/><br/>He/she sounds rather technical:<br/><i><br/>"The Active Player plays a card. He/she then narrates an advantage to his/her character."</i><br/><br/>Ze sounds otherworldly:<br/><i><br/>"The Active Player plays a card. Ze then narrates an advantage to zir character."</i><br/><br/>One sounds formal and old-fashioned:<br/><br/><i>"If one is the Active Player, one plays a card, then narrates an advantage to one's character."</i><br/><br/>So Ze, for example, sounds great in <i>Shock:</i> (sci-fi) but jarring in <i>The Hours</i> (a horror thing set in a mansion). So it depends on the voice you want to use for the text.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Larry, Joshua BR, you guys are killin' me. You have got to stop with the "it's technically incorrect" thing. You're killin' me.<br/><br/>Folks, don't let them snow you with confident, authoritative pronouncements. I'm sure they're nice guys, and they even have fine ideas about what to do if you're trying to avoid the singular <i>they</i>. But it is not technically incorrect. It is <i>socially</i> incorrect (admittedly, in some often important circles). Singular <i>they</i> is grammatically correct by every standard important to people who study language seriously and technically (usage, historical attestation, distribution, comprehensibility, internal consistency within the linguistic system, etc.). Even among linguists who disagree about very fundamental issues about language (such as whether we're born with some sort of generative grammar or not), there is simply no controversy about singular <i>they</i>. None. It doesn't matter whether you cut the cake historically or synchronically, you're going to get the same result. There is worldwide consensus among linguists on this, and there has been for a very long time. Do you know how rare a good consensus is among scholars? We get paid to prove each other wrong! <br/><br/>Please don't believe this old bit of folklore. There <i>are</i> good reasons to avoid singular <i>they</i>. Most of them have to do with the popularity of this bit of folklore and some of its tiresome ilk among social gatekeepers. But don't avoid using singular <i>they</i> just because you've been tricked or bullied into believing it is grammatically incorrect. Avoid it for a good reason, like maybe you really want that job, and it's really not a big deal to avoid <i>they</i>. Avoid it for the same reason you get a nice, new haircut before you go to the interview.    <br/><br/>I'm not sure I have the time or energy right now to get into the tiresome old argument this always entails, and if this were RPG.net or some super high traffic site, I definitely wouldn't have even bothered to write this much. But it still pains me right down to my professional pride every time I hear it passed on as gospel.<br/><br/>Can you hear me whimpering from the pain? I'm whimpering.<br/><br/>Rich                        </div>

                            Good stuff.  I think this is important and I want to model inclusive language and behavior.  It is difficult.<br/><br/>So my game is GM-less and highly procedural, and I've got text like this:<br/><br/><b>"For example, perhaps the Mission reaches a point where the player characters are pinned down by machine gun fire.  A player might narrate the terror his character feels, and immediately jump into his Personal Scene, which focuses on how his character overcame the fear of telling his girlfriend he loved her."</b><br/><br/>I could de-genderify it thus:<br/><br/><b>"For example, perhaps the Mission reaches a point where the player characters are pinned down by machine gun fire.  A player might narrate abject terror, and immediately jump into a Personal Scene, which focuses on how the character overcame the fear of telling his girlfriend he loved her."</b><br/><br/>But it feels weaker, less specific.  Another example:<br/><br/><b>"The Leader can choose his own character if he likes.  He must explain - but never defend - his decision."</b><br/><br/>De-gendered:<br/><br/><b>"The Leader need not choose another player's character.  The Leader should explain, but not defend, the decision."</b><br/><br/>Wordy and weak and passive.  I'd love to see some strong retoolings of these two snippets.  <br/><br/>All the extended examples in the game include female players and characters, anyway.                        </div>

                            In Panty Explosion you play only female students, but I tried to use "student" for everything. If I had to make a reference to the player I used "she" or "her". For examples we (Matt actually) developed a set of fictional players, both male and female. So you'd get stuff like " Matt decided that his character Yumi would confess her love to Tomo. Yumi walked up to the other girl nervously and tried to look her in the eye. A blush rose across her face". Thats what our examples tended to look like.<br/>
<br/>
You play boys and girls in Classroom Deathmatch. I still prefer to use "student" where I can, but I find that instead of trying to be gender neutral I just insert "he" or "she" whenever I want. I alternate pretty widly between the two, so you'll get whole sections of "he" and then a whole chapter of "she".<br/>
<br/>
For my new game The Year We All Died I'm trying to come up with something thats gender neutral that reflects the nature of the characters. TYWAD is a 2 player game about young lovers at the end of the world. I've been refering to the players as "the lovers" or as "the couple", but both sound really cheesy.<br/>

                            Rich, I completely empathize! <br><br>Last night I became sensitive about my usage of who/whom that I went online and downloaded several proper usage tutorials.

It's like a bit of actual play to remind us that this isn't about politics or personal agenda. In this case it's about inclusion.

                            I alternate between "he or she" and "she or he." It's awesome that everyone is thinking about it. Going with 'he' is no longer a viable choice, and that's pretty satisfying, despite what some freaks on RPGnet think.<br/><br/>The neologisms, while admirable, won't catch on. <i>cf.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><b>"The Leader need not choose another player's character.  The Leader should explain, but not defend, the decision."</b></blockquote>
Sometimes it helps me to re-think the sentence at -1 level of zoom. What are the important bits of info? 
<ul>
<li>Being able to choose any character, not just your own?<br/>Not to forget that you can choose your own and not just another player's?<br/>Explain but don't defend? </li>
</ul>
How does it fit with the information that comes before it and after it? Sometimes you're better off dealing with the pronoun stuff so that you don't present ambiguous information.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I use "you" a lot in my latest stuff. Such as, "If you're the leader, you can choose any character, your own or another player's."                        </div>

                            Thanks, Matt.  Clearly separating player choices and character choices is super important in this, so I've adopted a more removed voice and specified "the player" or "the character" or "the Leader's character's Scene" or whatever.  But I'm also using the direct address you're suggesting:<br/><br/><b>"It's important to note that unlike exposing, you can threaten or destroy another character's Thing Held Dear as easily as your own."</b><br/><br/>So maybe I can go back through and re-write all the gender-specific stuff in direct address to the reader as player.                        </div>

                            I like "they" in some contexts, but it can sometimes confuse the meaning.  I've personally started using "one" quite a bit.<br/><br/>It's funny, because I would like to think that the pronouns used in the text didn't really have that much of an effect on me, but I have to admit that I think the use of "she" to refer to the GM in <i>The Mountain Witch</i> really did help me feel more comfortable in inhabiting the role of the GM.  Generally speaking, I like texts that use a lot of specific examples, and either assign one gender pronoun to the GM and one to the players, or make an effort to use both equally.  I sometiems find it confusing when authors very carefully alternate pronouns every paragraph, though...<br/><br/>Tangental grumpiness: <br/>I also have to admit that I recently went all grumpy over the use of "Sire" in the Vampire books to denote the vampire, male or female, who Embraced your character.  I'm playing Vampire for the first time (<i>Dark Ages Vampire</i>, if you're curious) and in working on my backstory, I suddenly realized that I was consistently imagining my Sire as male, due to the language.  I realize that it's supposed to demonstrate the vampires' tendency to hold men and women as equal, but to me using a very specifically gendered term to do so just does NOT work.  The only other context I've otherwise encountered "sire" on a regular basis (aside from as a form of address to a king) is in animal breeding, where the male stud is frequently referred to as the "sire" or as having "sired" a bloodline.  Such specifically biological connotations made it very distracting for me.  Maybe I'm just weird, though.                        </div>

                            Vincent did a really great job with this in DitV: he used second person in most of the text, which neatly sidesteps the issue. I did this in Mortal Coil, too, leaving me only the example text where I needed to use gendered pronouns, but then they were referring to specific fictional characters who had already been assigned gender.<br/><br/>Here's Jason's text using this method:<br/><br/><b>"For example, perhaps the Mission reaches a point where the player characters are pinned down by machine gun fire. You might narrate the terror your character feels, and immediately jump into your Personal Scene, which focuses on how your character overcame the fear of telling his girlfriend he loved her."</b><br/><br/>I think this actually increases the impact of the text, by making it more relevant to the reader.<br/><br/>Edit: and I see that I'm echoing Matt here, as well.                        </div>

                            I use male pronouns in carry, because all of the characters in the book are male. I also clearly say "this book uses all male pronouns" in the introduction, and the example GM is female (and referred to with female pronouns in the examples, of course).<br/><br/>Which is to say, I think it is important to make a considered choice about such things, and your choice can be to go with "traditional" useage, if it's appropriate, in my opinion.                        </div>

                            I just combed my ms and found eighteen paragraphs where I use exclusively masculine pronouns (in 89 pages, so I'm not doing too bad).  I'm going to change all those to second person and be done with it.  I'm not seeing any immediate drawbacks, as long as the divide between player and character remains crystal clear.  I think "you" will actually help with this.  I already went through and purged every reference to "you" referring to characters a few weeks ago - that's just sloppy writing.                        </div>

                            The use of "you" is very clever. That's nice.<br/><br/>In GRS, I use "he" from start to finish, because it reflects the tone of the game: women just aren't on the radar.<br/><br/>Although I imagine Jason won't use it, that's probably an option for Grey Ranks as well. After all, that's how documents were written in those days: a non-specific example person was always "he".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Sweet agatha is written in the first person, so i sidestep a lot of this by refering to things with I, but in general i like to refer to users (my prefered term for players) in the second person. Its a lot more engaging, as has been stated more clearly previously.<br/><br/>I like to consider myself a feminist, a believer in equality for the sexes, but Ze, Zim, Heesh, whatever. All that stuff is so nobly intentioned, and falls so flat. Whenever i see those things in print i get completly thrown off and immediatly lose track of what is being talked about. Because they are made up words. No one ever uses them in verbal communication so they don't have any context, they are just roadblocks to clear understanding. <br/><br/>Also, they come off really condecendingly. Like the writer is so ABOVE pronouns. What, you're above pronouns, really? Are adverbs the new black? Dangling participles the new hip accessory?<br/><br/>Lastly, these words, these neologisms, they smell bad, like patouli and granola and canadian hashish. (ok, this last bit is a joke, and little well meaning proding, please don't take offense).<br/><br/>FULL DISCLOSURE: as evidenced by what has just passed before your eyes, i am not a cunning linguist, my grammer is for shit, my spelling a crime against humanity, and the European Union is preseantly debating a law that would punish my punctuation habits with manditory jail time. (seriously, its like a comma buffet up there). I am not any sort of authority on what is proper or Correct, I am however very confident in my ability to judge what is readable and what people are able to understand easily (it's what i do for a living). So for what its worth, that is the source of this post. (I'm also woefully ignorant of canadian hashish... woefully)                        </div>

                            Oh, I forgot the second-person sidestep, which is actually very very useful, yes.<br/><br/>John, the "drawback" to using second-person is when you start describing an interaction between two players.  Only one of them can be "you" and for the other guy you're pretty much back where you started.  However, you'd be surprised how often game examples are actually only about what one person is doing (see Jason's example).<br/><br/>Also, tangential: Esperanto, which Matt mentioned, has gendered pronouns and its nouns are gendered male by default and modified for feminine, but "Riist" Esperanto introduces a gender-inspecific pronoun and assumes ungendered nouns unless modified.  Just, y'know, saying.                        </div>

<p>I side with Joshua and with Rich. Bugaboos about singular they are like the bugaboos about double negatives and ending a sentence with a preposition. However, you can do some simple things to avoid even raising a question, like... using plural they where possible. Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GM should surprise his players.</li>
<li>GMs should surprise their players.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are cases where you can't avoid a singular, so you adopt another technique, like using <em>one</em>, specifying an imaginary person's gender, switching to the imperative (surprise your players!) or whatever's appropriate.</p>
<p>The one ironclad rule is: Don't write a disclaimer about the use of language. If you're going with the "GM is female, PCs are male" approach, don't explain it, just <em>do</em> it. Disclaimers are whiney and a waste of space. Only exception I can think of is if you feel the need to use a neologism, you should have a one-sentence explanation of it up front. But personally, I would avoid the neologisms, because they never last; what happened to "E" and "Co"? That's what's going to happen to "Ze".</p>

                            In Beast Hunters, I try to avoid the pronouns by referring to the roles (Hunter, Challenger), but if it comes up, I usually use "he" for the Hunter and "she" for the Challenger, with a good dose of "you" in there as well.  Sometimes I mix them up just for no reason.  Keep them guessing, you know <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>As the guy who picked a new last name with my wife as an expression of our egalitarian relationship, I do think that language and conventions matter and we can find new ways around them.  But in the process you'll make a bold statement that might have side effects, so you need to be ready for that.  It took me a while to show my family that my picking a new name was not a rejection of them, and that whole heap of trouble and upset was a side effect of the name change, though the change itself was meant as a celebration of this new union.  They might have missed out on experiencing our egalitarian relationship in practice because of their reflexive reaction to a particular expression of it.  Luckily, things settled after a while and everything's great now.<br/><br/>Similarly, using "ze" might turn off some people (either because they think it's weird or because it makes the text harder to read) who then might miss out on playing a game that challenges gender roles, thereby having less effect overall than it could have.  I'm not saying you shouldn't do it, but be aware that bold statements can often cause strong reactions.  Sometimes that's just what's needed.  Other times it's distracting from the essence of what you're doing.  That's just something to consider.                        </div>

                            Several people have mention <i>Shock</i> as a good example of the use of gender-neutral constructs.  I bought it back at at GenCon last year and was eager to dive into it based on what I'd heard.  But when I cracked it open, I had two reactions:
<ul>
<li>My gut reaction was that this was very pretentious.  I understood the point of it and put aside my first impression, but I also knew that some of my players wouldn't.  Thus, it wound up in my "my group won't play this" pile.</li>
<li>For some reason, it played hell with my mild dyslexia.  I found myself unable to follow the text without considerable effort &amp; several re-reads, all because of these unnatural words.  (From a logical standpoint, I think it's ridiculous that I had this problem with <i>Shock</i>, but knowing it was ridiculous didn't cure it.)</li>
</ul>
The thing to keep in mind is that a game is partly an instruction manual.  Anything that removes clarity is going to decrease the population who can understand and play your game without a personal explanation/demonstration (i.e. everyone who orders your game online based off of a review, or are sold it at a con but didn't get a chance to demo it).  Such neologisms can remove clarity for some people.  Like I said, I understand why <i>Shock</i> was written that way, but that understanding doesn't fix clarity issues.                        </div>

                            Ryan, it probably wasn't any sort of dyslexia, just the normal reading process getting mucked up.  The gender-neutral pronouns in Shock: (sie? I forget which it is) probably just aren't one of your sight words -- words that you recognize on sight without recognizing and decoding the individual letters.  Generally, your brain sort of expects anything four (or five) letters or smaller to be a sight word, and focuses its letter recognition and decoding processes on longer words.  Your eyeball literally flicks right over the little words with your brain assuming that that flick is enough to recognize it easily.  (Sie is actually one of the less disruptive neologisms since it can be easily mistaken in that flick for 'she' -- which kind of totally defeats the purpose of using the word.)  The 'missed' words start piling up until you can't decode the meaning of whole sentences.  You have to go back and ploddingly go word to word, making sure you read each and every one, forcing your brain and eye to get every single letter.  It's like reading when you're in kindergarten (or whenever you learned to read) -- <em>exhausting</em>.  In a parallel point, it's very much like games that use attribute abbreviations throughout the rules text -- very hard for new readers to follow, but once you get used to it (ie, add ST, DX, and PS to your sight words) you barely notice it any more.                        </div>

                            Hey:<br/><br/>Matt's and Kirsten's comments are worth talking about, I think, but slightly different subject matter. Can we have a thread about content vs. context? There was an interesting blog post about that recently, although I can't conjure a link at the moment. There's a link on John Kim's LJ if anyone is less lazy than I am.                        </div>

                            Edit: Cross posted with Matt. I agree, let's spin this onto a new thread.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Dust Devils Revenged uses "he" in<i>all</i>cases. This was intentional, fully aware of discussions like this one.<br/><br/>The reason has jack-all to do with clods on RPGnet and lots to do with threads like this one.<br/><br/>If you think I'm a macho, sexist prick for doing that, go play/buy something else. I'm not interested, and you're not paying attention very well.</blockquote>
Matt, was there an RPGnet thread about this? I feel like I'm missing specific context related to your post.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure what you mean by "and lots to do with threads like this one."<br/><br/>My intent isn't to denounce a specific methodology of writing game text. I'm only interested in what's the best way to incorporate gender neutral language if that was a feature I wanted to include in my own game text.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>The thing to keep in mind is that a game is partly an instruction manual.  Anything that removes clarity is going to decrease the population who can understand and play your game without a personal explanation/demonstration (i.e. everyone who orders your game online based off of a review, or are sold it at a con but didn't get a chance to demo it). </blockquote>
Great point. This is something I'm constantly thinking about. This is only tangentially related but I once stumbled upon an article talking about how users read on the web. Very interesting:  <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html</a> It's all just part of the collective notes I've been taking on writer better game text (print or online) for instructional purposes.                        </div>

                            I did it for a few different reasons. I did not do it intending the game to be played only by men.<br/><br/>First, rightly or wrongly, the Westerns represented in film are, by a ridiculous majority, about men and men's issues. It is about violence, redemption, and -- occasionally -- redemption THROUGH violence. I find that to be a primarily male topic (certainly not exclusively so). I find it to be primarily male in the same way that I find sexuality and redemption and redemption THROUGH sexuality a primarily female topic. <br/><br/>Pointing to our exitence as humans and saying that the women as have much to answer for as the men in terms of violence and lawlessness is pretty ignorant. That's what I'm saying. Frankly, the men fucked it up good ... but on the other hand is the violence <i>always</i> fucked up? Dust Devils says "Not always, but you gotta work it out yourself when it's right and wrong."<br/><br/>To be sure, there are exceptional female characters in Western films, and exceptional women-oriented themes and directions. Not a single one of the movies I cite in the book, for example, explores a female protagonist. When there are women, they are whores or schoolteachers. Either virginal or promiscuous hussies. There are too few "regular ol' women." William Munny in Unforgiven is wrathful for whom? Whores. And, the movie makes no apologies that they are whores who <i>fuck</i> people for <i>money</i>. Oh, the women characters are often smart or decisive. Or both. Or, they are proto-men, like Calamity Jane (see Deadwood for a particularly butch rendition), trying hard to be women in men's clothing and men's roles, shedding all their womanly identity to become tough guys.<br/><br/>I make no judgment on that. I do so because I am not interested in challenging the Western tradition <i>in terms of gender</i>. Someone else can do that if they like. Wonderfully, I am quite certain someond can do it <i>by playing Dust Devils</i>. I'm all for it. It's just not what I represent in my book.<br/><br/>So, I deliberately made Dust Devils with a kind of "Man's Man" voice. And, I did it in a book that many cite as a quality indie game. I did so because I think it's foolishness to set a standard across all possible products we could produce that must take on a particular political position or else suffer the consequences of social disdain in threads like this. I find that stiffling and moronic, and I think our indie scene is taking much for granted in the political sphere. If, oh, Prime Time Adventures doesn't properly represent Mexican people or transgendered roles or whatever ... so what?<br/><br/>And, I have yet to see anything like this "Well, I bough Book X, and I regret it because there is nary a She in sight. I will never play this game, and I recommend no one else buy or play it. It is the Devil." But, I see plenty of threads like this. And, I don't find it terribly consequential. <i>Conscientious</i>, yes. Consequential, no.<br/><br/>And, to be clear, I'm all for representing genders equally in gaming texts when I think it's appropriate. I did exactly what others have cited in Nine Worlds -- the game master is always female, the players always male. That's another reason I said it's foolishness to say I'm being a macho jerk, but that's up to the individual, I guess.<br/><br/>Odd note -- I do not cite <i>The Quick and the Dead</i>, the 90s movie with Sharon Stone in my book. It just didn't strike me as a good enough movie, that's all. That particular piece wasn't a gender issue, I don't think.                        </div>

                            Joshua, you're probably on the money there with your explanation, but from my end-user standpoint there's little difference in "I can't read this right now because my brain is screwing with me" and "I can't read this right now because of the language used."  The end result is the same, so I assumed that there's at least some relation.  In any case, I can plow through it if I focus and step down my reading process much like you mentioned, but it is exhausting and very much not fun.<br/><br/>Also, when it comes to "ze," I can't take that as anything but humorous.  I read that, and I instantly switch mentally to a mock German accent (a la Turkish from <i>Snatch</i> saying "Before ze Germans get here").  But that's probably just me.                        </div>

                            Matt S., thanks for the reply. Damn you type fast!!!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with most of what you said. And I believe the value of immediately consequential vs. conscientious is up to each individual to weigh and judge. But that is tangential to what this thread is about.<br/>
<br/>
This specific thread (as in the first post and the majority of the responses) is not about politics or setting standards. It is about technique. It's a "how to" thread. That's it.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, it was an awesome thread and I learned a hell of a lot. Thanks everyone!<br/>

Ok, I can see this (I was just really, really afraid that you were going to say something along the lines of "because 'he' has always been considered gender neutral' or some such nonsense and I apologize profusely for that -- it's just something I've encountered innumerable times from otherwise intelligent people, and it sets my teeth on edge like you wouldn't believe).<br><br>I do think that your reasoning has been reasonably well-represented in this thread, though -- I see some discussion of situations where certain wording or pronoun use might be more effective in one game vs. another (for example, that "ze" might work in certain contexts, depending on the bent of the game, but that in most it's just going to be distracting).<br><br>I do want to speak to this, though:

I might be in the oversensitive minority here, but things like this do really affect my feelings about a game and my decision to play it.  If I pick up a book in the store and discover that the author has chosen to assume a male audience <i>without a contextual reason for doing so</i> (if the whole idea of the game is that everyone is, oh, a gay man, or a male boxer, or a classic John Wayne cowboy, it's probably not going to bother me), then chances are I WILL put the book back on the shelf.  So it's consequential.  It's probably not going to affect the game's sales appreciably -- women gamers have gotten used to ignoring a lot of similar kinds of crap, after all -- but it can have consequences.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            For all the awful, Etta was actually pretty interesting in the original WW comics. She's resourceful, independent, and subtext-y, just like all the boy sidekicks. She got turned into pretty much a pure gag character before long, but if you ever read the original few years of stories, well, .... I'd play her.<br/><br/>(There exists an obscure but devoted segment of Diana-Etta shippers in the fandom. And they're not entirely without textual grounding.)                        </div>

                            I use "he" almost exclusively simply because I am a "he," and I tend to write from my own perspective (since its really the only one I have, last I checked).<br/>
<br/>
I do this mainly because it is simple, but also to avoid phoney-sounding language. I remember cracking open a published book filled with robots, violence and mayhem and was amused to find all the gender pronouns as "she." Every single author and collaberator was a man, save one suit in the editing department who was a female, and one guy who thanked his wife for "understanding." The target audiance was clearly young punks like myself at the time, and this hokey use of gender only served to draw the reader's attention to the entire issue.                        </div>

                            Graham, with respect, it depends on how you want to interpret my statement. I agree that the topic screams to be political and for many people their posts are probably driven for political reasons. But the intent of the thread was not political. And the execution was mostly political free.<br/>
<br/>
Overall this thread was as neutral as one could reasonably hope it could be. Almost no one stated that all game text should be X for Y reasons (outside of grammar). And looking at page 1 (50 posts), the majority of it is straight to the point and technical in nature. Hell many threads derail in less than 10 posts or lead to political back and forth straying from the thread's intended goal. It was pretty un-political till Matt made it so (I'm not attacking Matt here, I enjoyed his posts and I think he is brilliant). And my response was to him. Before that, my statement was pretty much true. You yourself had 3 very relevant posts on page 1 that were pretty much on board with the intent of the thread, non political, and technical.<br/>
<br/>
I don't like labeling a topic because of similar topics that came before it or by the contributions of a minority, say 2 out of 30+ participants. I also don't understand the intent of your post, especially after things have already calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                            I know it's going back a way in the thread, but I wanted to address something.<br/>
<br/>
Use of the second person to avoid this works, but is not some surprising technique. That is, it's a major choice to decide whether you want to use the intimate tone of "you and me" or to use the formal tone of "The GM and the author." Most importantly, don't ever switch between these modes in the middle of your text. Definitely don't use this just to avoid having to use one of the other methods, and then switch back to a formal tone elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
People report that when the tone changes back and forth between formal and informal that this makes reading really hard. Possibly worse, it makes the writing seem amaturish (I'm not making a judgment here, I'm just saying what many people find to be true). Vincent made the decision to go with informal and intimate all the way through, and that works for him. I really like the formal mode myself to the extent that people have commented that my texts are unpleasant to read like textbooks in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
I like textbooks...<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, yes, in terms of ease of writing, this argues in favor of using the informal tone on this one point. For myself, my writing tends to be formal enough that it's completely consistent with my tone to use "They", "The player," or even "One." I know it probably sounds archaic, but I like that.<br/>
<br/>
So, how would I write the challenge text?<br/>
<br/>
"The Leader can choose their own character if they like. One must explain - but never defend - one's decision."<br/>
<br/>
But in many cases, the problem is that this is lazy - you're just converting the sentence that popped into your head. If my sentence looks odd, it's because it's a conversion of one that works best with "he" in it. Better writing is to come up with an entirely diferent way of stating the idea.<br/>
<br/>
"The Leader selects any character, and then explains - but does not defend - the decision."<br/>
<br/>
Much mo betta.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I learned this lesson (not lazily converting, but rewriting) from Rich Forrest above, if I recall correctly, when he was editing Universalis or something for me. In all things gramatical, I defer to Rich. His point above isn't being given enough due. It's not "correct/incorrect" that really matters, it's what works.                        </div>

<p>I guess I should drop in here since Shock: has been mentioned twice already.</p>
<p>Under the Bed uses "they" because it's colloquial, which is appropriate in a game about children.</p>
<p>Shock: uses sie/hir because it's a neologism that gets to the core of one's cultural assumptions, which is what the game's about. Obviously, it makes it hard to read. That's because it's not saying exactly what you think it's saying.</p>
<p>I always use a gendered pronoun when the subject has a gender.</p>
<p>God never gets a pronoun (which is a separate, but maybe related, issue).</p>
<p>So, yes, I use gender neutral language because gender isn't at the core of what I'm discussing, though the question of gender might be. If I write a game like Bliss Stage, I'll give genders.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think Fred's Fudge standard is really good. It personalizes those jobs, to make the GM "she" and the players "he". It makes it so they're people, not just positions around a table. It could be willfully misread, but I think most are willing to see what that's saying.</p>

That's an interesting point. Certainly seeing "he" is more common than seeing "she" as the default pronoun, esspecially in technical manuals. Upon thinking about it, however, if a game is pretty obviously marketed tword women and written by women, seeing "he" all over the place would strike me as odd.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kkriegg</cite>I remember cracking open a published book filled with robots, violence and mayhem and was amused to find all the gender pronouns as "she." Every single author and collaberator was a man, save one suit in the editing department who was a female, and one guy who thanked his wife for "understanding." The target audiance was clearly young punks like myself at the time, and this hokey use of gender only served to draw the reader's attention to the entire issue.</blockquote>
Check the last line of the post: <i>The target audiance was clearly young punks like myself at the time, and this hokey use of gender only served to draw the reader's attention to the entire issue</i>.  Isn't that kind of the point? Like maybe to get 'young punks' to think about gender a little?<br><br>The thing is, if I pick up a game book, and see only male pronouns, male players, male PCs, and male NPCs, I have a very similar reaction "Oh. Clearly this is Not For Me(tm). Too bad, 'cause I sure like robot violence." So if I am to play, I have to get over it. Again. However, when a book is well-written and has a balance of gender representaion - some example players are female, some PCs, some NPCs, maybe even some playing across gender - then the default pronoun importance fades into the back-ground. I can't tell you what the default pronoun is in <i>Prime Time Adventures</i>, but I do know it's got gender balance. <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, while having a little of a male default, is totally clear about both men and women being Dogs, and very conscious of gender issues throughout the game. <i>carry; a game about war</i> is all male, and a very excellently written game that I love to play - the gender is consciously part of the game.<br><br>In <i>1001 Nights</i>, I use Shreyas' and Vincent's techniques of using specific gendered example people and third person. In <i>Miss Schiffer's School for Young Ladies of Quality</i>, it's not only addressed to the young ladies in question, thus using  female pronouns, but all PCs are women - the gender is consciously part of the game.<br><br>If more attention was on writing well and having good gender balance through-out the game text, the question of what to use as a default pronoun  could be a lot less of a thing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
