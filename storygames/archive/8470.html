I knew a guy in Japan who was a <i>hashiriya</i>, a street racer, and it was all he talked about. He drove this crazy insane Skyline GTR that was pimped out beyond all imagining and I think he told me he'd put $100,000+ into it. He lived very modestly - you'd never know where all his money went unless you saw his car. He'd take it out after midnight when the highways were relatively clear so he could wring that beast of his out. I went with him to one of the roadside rest areas where his people gathered and their cars were equally tricked out. That was years ago and I lost touch with him and I don't know if he ended up wrapped around a lamp post in his GTR or what, but it's still quite a memory for me.<br/><br/>And that's why there's gotta be car fetishism, because without it, you're not capturing the essence of what the lives of these people revolves around, IMO - their cars.<br/><br/>There's got to be a game in there somewhere...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187435/#Comment_187435" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T15:59:25+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  3:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2009 3:59PM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>There's got to be a game in there somewhere...</blockquote>\nGiven all that, I would say there was a Sorcerer one-sheet in it, at least.<br/><br/>You could stay on the FATE avenue as well, and give the cars aspects and stats as well, to reflect the tricked-out natures of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187437/#Comment_187437" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T16:04:57+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  4:04PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the game has to be about pimping the car, Racing, and what the person does to make it happen.<br/><br/>Off the cuff I would look at a rewrite of Sorcerer where the car is your demon and your life is always in conflict with your passion for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fragmad" title="fragmad"><img alt="fragmad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fragmad">fragmad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187439/#Comment_187439" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T16:05:42+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  4:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2009 4:06PM by fragmad.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>You could stay on the FATE avenue as well, and give the cars aspects and stats as well, to reflect the tricked-out natures of them.</blockquote>\nThat sounds like an awesome way to handle cars. <br/><br/>When you say 'car fetishism' do you mean raw numbers?

Like that.<br/><br/>And then you have those scenes where the two drivers are squaring off, boasting about what they've got under the hood, trying to one-up each other, and then the only way to settle it is to put the hammer down and burn some rubber.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187452/#Comment_187452" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T16:35:19+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  4:35PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thor</cite>So the game has to be about pimping the car, Racing, and what the person does to make it happen.<br/><br/>Off the cuff I would look at a rewrite of Sorcerer where the car is your demon and your life is always in conflict with your passion for it.</blockquote>\nThis may be the way I'll go about trying it.

It's basically a weird combination tabletop/larp thing, where you sit in four chairs arranged as if you were actually in a car, playing the driver, shotgun, backseat driver, and shifter, respectively.<br/><br/>More recently, I bought a bunch of matchbox cars and was working on a system where you laid out playing cards, connecting them together to create the track (angling them to make turns and so forth).  The speed of the matchbox cars was measured in card widths and players moved their cars simultaneously each turn, pushing them with their fingers.

Standard rpg mechanics with stats and dice wouldn't be too far off the mark.<br/><br/>Initial D is about the process of learning, detail by detail. The idea of car abilities as fluff is perfect for it, because Initial D does not use realistic performance comparisons, and the mechanic of racing has no variable elements. Instead, each race is a mystery, and solving the mystery (figuring out the one spot where the performance of your car exceeds the opponent's car) almost always wins the race.<br/><br/>Wangan Midnight sets up the cars as opponents to their drivers, with each upgrade to the car increasing the danger, but also increasing the potential success (much like a raise in Legend of the Five Rings). It's not skill that's the primary determiner of races, though, it's spirit. Racing is an emotional struggle with fear, how close you can take your car to the limit.<br/><br/>It's just been too many decades (I can actually use the plural!) since I've seen Cannonball Run, so I'm not going to make the attempt to figure it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187703/#Comment_187703" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T07:24:10+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  7:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I don't know a lot about the genre, but I have read a few Initial D.  Initial D, like a lot of racing manga, basically comes down to a character drama with lots of background flavor.  Eseentially, at its core, it's not really different than One-Piece or (better example) Yakitate Japan (but with CARS instead of BREAD), or Max Stirling from Macross, and basically comes down to:<br/><br/>The Problems With Being The Best. With LOTS of color.<br/><br/>The Initial D guy (forgot his name) is the best. Period. And all the drama around the manga is about him dealing with that, as he's really not out to be a super drift racer or whatever. <br/><br/>Thing is, even though that's all it is (and it is an interesting source of drama!), I couldn't imagine just running it with PTA. Or at least, I could, but man... not having rules for all that awesome color (car engines! Tires! Drift-based-tuning!) would be like an open wound... just something that needs to be filled!<br/><br/>I can't help much here, but I think what you're looking at is essentially a character drama (though Canonball Run is very different than Initial D), but with lots and lots of awesome color crunch.. to me, I'd love to see that in rules, but I know nothing enough to actually do it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187707/#Comment_187707" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T07:33:10+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  7:33AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 7:33AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call on Formula De, JWalt.

Make sure that cycle is a feedback loop that simultaneously satisfies the player and makes him hungry for more. <br/><br/>Only then do you start nailing down crap like attributes, skill lists, and (god forbid) dice mechanics.

Maybe you have a day job, but at night you're all speed and gasoline, tearing down the highways and racing other gearheads for cash. Wins supply the hard cash to buy better parts for your car and repair the damage you've done. <br/><br/>Play cycle: <br/><br/>1. Create a character. Every player gets a driver and some friends. Distribute points between driving skills, mechanical skills, and social skills. Depend on your friends (NPCs attached to your character) for the stuff you're not good at, but expect them to have their own demands.<br/><br/>2. Create a car! Cars have skills, too, and you improve them with cash. There's a huge car skill list with stuff like "custom-tuning" and "adjustable fuel lines" and "aluminum radiators."<br/><br/>3. Drive. Role-play situations about your racing life. Make deals for parts. Help out your friends so they'll keep your car purring. Show off at car shows. Race! Earn money at races and shows.<br/><br/>4. Improve your skills and your car skills. Experience on the road and "in the clutch" earn you XP to spend on personal skills. Spend money earned at shows and in races on better stuff for your car. <br/><br/>5. Repeat. Drive and improve. Drive and improve. Intersperse scenes with friends. If you want a more action-packed game, introduce enemies, drugs, guns, and angry criminal types. Drive fast or die.<br/><br/>Important questions:<br/><br/>* Can you die? Since this is a cinematic driving game and dying isn't fun, maybe the worst that happens is you total your car and you get Fucked Up (hospital bills, etc.). <br/><br/>* What can you improve on a car? See Gran Turismo or other console racing games for pointers. Generally interesting "skills" a car might have are acceleration, speed, handling, and braking. Also, skills for "looks" (detailing, intimidation, etc.). Also internal mechanical things like "cooling" and "diagnostics."<br/><br/>* How is racing handled? I'm imagining a street "dungeon" with hidden traps, corners and intersections that require skill checks, and so on. The rules should let the <i>player</i> use terrain to his benefit (e.g., he knows his car is good on the straight-away, so when he hits the mile-long stretch of I-66, he makes a car Speed check. Each race has a default time (in seconds, probably) and each skill check can subtract (good) or add (bad) seconds. The fastest time wins!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187753/#Comment_187753" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T10:47:47+00:00" title="January 12, 2009 10:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 10:56AM by Per_Fischer.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Good call on Formula De, JWalt.
