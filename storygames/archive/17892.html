I've gathered up a new group of people who are down to play basically whatever I have for them (all new to the hobby), but I don't want to exclude the friends who had the fight - I'm still close to all of them. <br/><br/>What I was thinking of doing was, basically, alternating those guys - have the 3 new guys in for every session (maybe once a fortnight), and have A and B one session, then C in the next session, then A and B again, and so on. It's obviously not ideal, but it means everyone gets to play at least sometimes, and it stops A, B, and C from having to deal with each other.<br/><br/>Has anyone done anything like that in their games? I'm worried for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I'm looking at running Monsterhearts or Leverage; while I think they'll both mechanically be able to handle the "slightly different line-up each week" thing I'm not sure that the fiction will be able to deal with it. (Especially MH - there's no good reason for teenagers to be out of town every second week, is there?) Second, I think it might be tough on the regular players, having to keep track of who was there for important things and who wasn't. The other thought was running two games in alternating weeks (MH for A and B, Leverage for C), but I'm pretty new to GMing and I'm not sure I can take that on just yet.<br/><br/>I'd appreciate any thoughts you might have, especially anything coming from your own experiences dealing with stuff like this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404894/#Comment_404894" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T19:14:54+00:00" title="January 28, 2013  7:14PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you ever play short-term games, like one-shots, or short runs of a few sessions each?<br/><br/>That could make it easier.

(We started out playing Our Last Best Hope, and have kind of developed from there.) That's why I'm eager to start heading towards something a little longer-form.<br/><br/>As to why I'm GMing... well, a couple of reasons. I'm the most into the whole role-playing world, in terms of both experience and wider reading, so the role kind of falls on me by default. I enjoy it, too, sometimes more than I enjoy playing as a PC - I'm a little emotionally detached in real life, and GMing hits the right level of "involved in what's going on but outside it" for me to get into it properly. It's not that GMing one game is too much for me, though, it's more that I don't think I'm capable of doing two different things in two alternating weeks and keeping them properly separate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404904/#Comment_404904" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T20:21:44+00:00" title="January 28, 2013  8:21PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's what I meant, though: if running two games at once doesn't sound like fun to you, you're under no obligation to do so.

Some of the players show up on most playdates but most participate only sporadically. To ensure that the right amount of people show up at the right times we use www.trello.com where we can get a good overview of when people are free to play. Using this kind of scedueling device you can put the responsibility of the two not meeting in their hands instead of you having to juggle them around. So, get trello up and running and just say something like: "Hey everyone, sign up to the dates when you are available and we will play something where enough people sign up!". Of course longer campaigns (or even few session campaigns) are troublesome but not impossible (we have a few running in parallel right now) so I would recommend focusing on one-session games like Fiasco, While the World Ends, The Daughters of Verona, Best Friends, etc etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404923/#Comment_404923" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T05:42:57+00:00" title="January 29, 2013  5:42AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2013 5:44AM by Harlequin.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did this before very successfully.<br/>In Mutant Chronicles, of all things.<br/><br/>It began as something simple, where there were two high-paying jobs offered at once, and the characters shuffled themselves into teams.  I understand that your set-up is less ideal.<br/><br/>The groups were in different fictional locations, but they would catch news from one another.  When things got terrible on Venus, I sent the group on Luna the headline.  They thought it was interesting, and it built into their own tension, but they had no idea it was the other players that were causing the trouble.  They affected each other in little ways like this.  It made things easier for me.<br/><br/>Where one group would do a favor for one organization, (say a less-than-legal arms dealer...) the other group would get ambushed by cheap thugs with surprisingly effective weapons (which they could only afford because of the less-than-legal arms dealer).<br/><br/>Definitely try it.  It can be a lot of fun, and you shouldn't have to feel like the groups will do completely unrelated stuff, or completely intertwined stuff.  You'll find your own style and maybe everyone will have fun.<br/><br/>... but that would require two entirely separate groups each week.

Just hearing about that person - or anything connected to that person - would make me furious.<br/><br/>I don't see why you should run the same game with the same story with different people that dislike each other. For less confusion for the new players, play different games with different constellations. It will feel more natural for the new ones to play one game with one guy and another game with the two others.<br/><br/>[edit] There will also probably be a leak of talking shit about each other from both parties, which will affect the new players.

But 'experience and wider reading' doesn't stop less experienced players from having a go so you can have a break from time to time; and 'it falls on me by default' is an outright terrible reason why you should have to do it. More importantly, I'm worried that trying to please everyone like this means more stress for you, likely resulting in less fun at for everyone involved.
