In every one, I could see where people broke the rules. Twice, this was fun, and a third time, it wasn't. The third time was with a game I have never really promoted, and I finally figured out why: it's not fun if you don't follow the rules exactly. In the other two cases, the game still worked and was fun, although I know if other rules were broken, it wouldn't be fun.<br/><br/>So here's what I learned:<br/><br/>- Expect people to play your game wrong. If you don't, you will design a brittle game.<br/>- If you have rules that are inviolate - and these should be a small subset - make them prominent and easy to remember.<br/><br/>This seems really simple, but it's been a big insight for me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68449/#Comment_68449" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T09:11:05+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  9:11AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

That's because it's a game that's basically impossible to play unless you follow the rules pretty strictly. Now, this is intentional. But, it also means the game is a tough sell for one person to convince his/her game group to play.<br/><br/>I'm ok with Nine Worlds being brittle. It is precisely the game I wanted to make. I'm very pleased with it. But, it also helped me learned lessons -- some bad, but many more good -- about how people use my designs and designs in general. <br/><br/>So, yeah.

I have all these very symmetric areas in the game, and in one part of the character sheet, you're supposed to write action phrases (verb - object). Someone I was playing with wrote down something like "great cook," which isn't an action phrase at all, and I started to correct the player, but I realized it wouldn't be fun to do that.<br/><br/>In TSOY, Jason was running a Bringing Down the Pain, and he did something totally strange to me: he determined whether a conflict was parallel or perpendicular by whether the abilities being used were associated with the same pool or not. It's not a bad rule, though, and it didn't really screw anything up.<br/><br/>You guys are already getting the term wrong. Christian, Beast Hunters isn't brittle because there's one inviolate thing. Having the entire game be an inviolate thing is brittleness. Jason - keeping the inviolate rules with the GM is probably smart, in that less people have to remember them, but expecting your GM to remember everything is a bad idea.<br/><br/>Matt, I never knew how to articulate what I don't like about Nine Worlds, but I think you're right. I look at it and think, "I can't play this right. It's too complex and I don't know what to do." That's a little different, in that I can't get a hand-hold on the rules, but it's related.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68519/#Comment_68519" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T12:48:37+00:00" title="May 11, 2007 12:48PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2007 12:49PM by Dave Younce.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R.
