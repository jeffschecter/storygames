I was planning online games for those days anyway and I figured, why not make an event out of it?<br/><br/><img alt="image" height="300" src="http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e30/highmoon/concurrent.png" style="border: 2px;" width="300"/><br/><br/><b>CONcurrent</b> is a gaming con held online (and at local venues) running parallel to Gen Con, from Wednesday 8/15 to Sunday 8/19. The hub can be found on G+ at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/CONcurrent-con" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/CONcurrent-con</a>.<br/><br/>I'm using ConPlanner to organize the con. You can find the con page at <a href="http://conplanner.com/CONcurrent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://conplanner.com/CONcurrent</a>. We even have people holding events in their local area as part of the con! You can start Adding Events at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/CONcurrent-events" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/CONcurrent-events</a>.<br/><br/>I love Gen Con, and I love the energy that is generated during that week. With CONcurrent, I hope to be a part of that wave at home while the party's going on in Indy.<br/><br/>Drop by and join in!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
