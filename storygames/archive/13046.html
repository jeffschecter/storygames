I gotta say, some of them really jump out at me as exciting... What are you jazzed about?<br/><br/>My list would have:<br/>- <i>Red Land Black Land</i>, Jason Godesky (I'm a sucker for anything with the phrase "Scorpion King" in the text)<br/>- <i>Walkabout</i>, Michael Wenman (aboriginal myths, bad-ass aboriginal art in the booklet. Exciting!)<br/>- <i>Walkers in the Witchery Way</i>, Alla Hoffman (skinwalkers! in a game! how cool is that??)<br/>- <i>Deserting Paradise</i>, Joe Mcdaldno (magic, immortal teenagers are the draw; slick mechanics keep me interested)<br/>- <i>Maddenhaffen</i>, Renee Knipe (an interesting spin on very <i>Warhammer</i>-inspired material. Also, rat-people ^_^)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294068/#Comment_294068" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T13:20:23+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  1:20PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm most excited by Alex Fradera's A Journey, which is about Tony Blair.

I would have liked to have given it a playtest with my regular group, but because I was overseas I ended up testing with two people who\u2019d never played a story-game before in their lives (and therefore had no frame of reference with which to suggest changes or compare) and myself (who knew the game so well I\u2019d never have spotted some issues if they\u2019d hit me with a cricket bat). It will get its full play-test and polish at some point. Right at the moment though, I need some distance from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294134/#Comment_294134" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T00:03:56+00:00" title="September 21, 2010 12:03AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man-of-Letters, Man-of-War<br/>Haven't read a lick of this one yet, but followed the thread where it was being hashed out.

As has been echoed many times, however, I certainly plan to try to read as many of them as I can greedily gobble with my eye holes. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a first time Game Chef, both in terms of making a game and actually being around for when all the games were completed and brand spanking new, I am totally pumped.

(And mobile, devouring cities? Cool!)<br/><br/>I did the same - Tony Blair's A Journey was literally the first thing that popped into my mind when I saw the theme, and the rest fell straight from that obvious connection. No special acts of re-imagining, at least on my part. Just what my head spat out.<br/><br/>I suspect it's the same for many submissions.<br/><br/>I do believe each of us is a unique, couldn't-design-us-if-you-tried conduit for taking the various stuffs of life, mixing them up and spraying them into the world.

I'm nearly positive that the reason that didn't really happen is the inclusion of the ingredient "skin". Both "city" and "desert" immediately trigger a number of obvious notions for a game. "Edge" isn't quite as obvious, but ideas flowing from it are still pretty immediate. The initial reaction to skin is "how the fuck do I make a game about skin"? <br/><br/>I think all such contests should have at least one ingredient like this.

I'm quite excited by the character generation questions. Specifically, a player creates a significant person (or thing) in their character's life and the other players ask difficult questions like "what did you do when you found X having sex with y?" thereby creating a tragic, and unpredictable, character history. These histories are told as flashbacks as the characters execute a doomsday bombing run on a giant, tyrannic machine. In the foreground, essentially, we are taking a step through each character's life while, in the background, we are seeing how they sacrifice themselves for a greater cause. Intense.<br/><br/>I also have a to-read list:<br/><br/><b>Danger Mountain!</b> (Just because <i>Jason Morningstar</i> wrote it\u2014I'm a sheep for big names)<br/><b>Silver and White</b> (again, <i>Jackson Tegu</i>... )<br/><b>Memoir</b> (How will you be remembered? That hits a primal nerve.)<br/><b>Nowhere Road</b> (I'm hooked by the line "You think you know what you want. But the other players know what you Really Need.")<br/><b>7SSR </b>(Good story hook:  stuck in an abandonded city in the middle of a desert with some brand new tattoos and a note addressed to them)<br/><b>The Hand of Gulliver the Man-Mountain</b> ("The world\u2019s first manual-digital-tactile roleplaying game.")<br/><b>Never to Die</b> (It sounds vulgar and mean, which I'm sort of turned on by, but I also think there's a mundanity here that I'd like to express myself in a story game... that's probably a shit way of saying it. What I mean is that there is something common about this story, something gritty and opaque, that I don't often tell in my own game sessions. I'm looking forward to seeing what that feels like.)<br/><b>What Happened Here</b> (Two player game: always interesting.)<br/><b>Walkabout </b>(I liked the enthusiasm and the ozzie perspective during the development process. Because of that, this might be the game I play.)<br/><b>A City</b> (Sounds vague and artsy.)<br/><b>A Sojourn in Alexandria</b> (Jason Pitre looks like the kind of guy who probably knows his shizzle. If he does, then this'll be a good read, and maybe even a game that I'd like to get my friends to try. History sells!)<br/><b>Going Home: An Urban Power Fantasy</b> ("Basically, \u201cFalling Down\u201d, the role playing game.")<br/><b>Sparks from the Fire</b> (Again, this is a name thing. I saw Brennan Taylor post "I made a good game," or something to that effect, and I believed him.)<br/><b>Over the Wall</b> (I'm interested in the idea of skin as currency.)<br/><b>Man-of-Letters, Man-of-Wars: A Game of Tactical Correspondence with a Chance of Drowning</b> (This has the most exciting premise and the most delicious blurb. It already sounds like a complete game that I'd pay for. I can't wait for this one, so I've purposely left it at the bottom of my list, dangling there like a carrot.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
