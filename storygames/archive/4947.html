It was with John S and Eppy from NYC, and another guy named Josh whose last name I never caught. There were definitely moments of awesome, and I wanted to talk about it here in case anyone's interested.<br/><br/>1) Specialties and Conflict Resolution: There's 5 specialties and you get to allocate points into them, but it's structured such that its easy to be really good at one thing but not great at a lot of things.  Each also has a one-use-only special ability for the person in the group with the highest score in that specialty. For example, the 'Mars' ability is for someone who kills to get what they want, and they can, once per session, kill someone with no dice rolled. When something comes up that puts your character 'at risk' you figure out which of those specialties applies, and you roll as many d6 as your score in that specialty. Depending how well you roll, you or the GM gets narration rights and the action is resolved. This worked pretty well, except when something would come up that wasn't really within scope on any of those specialties, or when a character was opposing another character (with the rules as written, GM never rolls any dice, which was a little boring for me, too). But the players looked for ways to use their "Once a game you may..." stunts, so those were kind of cool.<br/><br/>2) The players make up the challenges. They wanted to be a kind of eco-terrorist organization, so I gave them the challenge of kidnapping a CEO of a big oil company. So they set to work doing the 'planning stage' where they talked about how he was at the White House for a gala and (we were doing near-future) there was this crazy helicopter ops center thing above it and what other nations were there and so forth. I took studious notes and gave out dice to the team leader at the end for him to split up amongst the team. Then we launched right into it, and I had to look for ways to incorporate the challenges and obstacles they'd talked about. This part worked pretty well, but I wished I'd been able to include a 'twist' or two they didn't know about. <br/><br/>3) The 'trust' mechanic. GM is supposed to seed mistrust among the agents and pass out dice from time to time to people who are screwing over their fellow-agents. I wrote little secrets on pieces of paper and passed them out, like "Agent B is an FBI plant" to get them going. I don't know how this would work in games longer than a one-shot without very careful planning, but these dice did flow and it was fun.  Especially with players like John and Eppy who love getting screwed over. There was a moment when Josh had to choose which of them would get the shaft, and they had these great puppy-dog "No, pick me!" faces. <br/><br/>4) the 'timing' mechanic. There are a couple of ways that you're supposed to ratchet up the pressure as the game proceeds. I didn't do any of them because I wasn't prepared with a timer and knew I wouldn't remember to look at a clock in game, but I wish I had - it would have made them hurry and would have given it a very '24' feel. I definitely want to try doing something with that in the future. <br/><br/>In sum, this game has some excellent ideas, and probably works pretty well to pull together an espionage pick-up game or oneshot. For extended play, there are some kinks that I think would need to be addressed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111112/#Comment_111112" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T09:20:51+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  9:20AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>For example, the 'Mars' ability is for someone who kills to get what they want, and they can, once per session, kill someone with no dice rolled.
