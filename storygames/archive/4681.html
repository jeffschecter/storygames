I'm very good at it, and consistently get good grades on them, but I am so done with that, having already done an undergrad thesis and a master's thesis.  But right now, I'm taking a grad-level Music History class, and our term papers are coming up\xe2\u20ac\u201dwe have to have our proposals, along with a tentative bibliography list, turned in by next Monday night.  <br/><br/>Tonight, before class, I spoke with the professor and explained to him my frustrations with traditional paper-writing... you see where this is going.  Basically, I asked him (in not so many words) if I could write an RPG about composers in Renaissance Italy, where they compete for patronage from the emerging bourgeouisie, and try to avoid getting either assassinated by their patrons' rivals, excommunicated by the Church, or completely alienated from all they love, forced to compromise their art for money.<br/><br/>Right now, my ideas for how to implement this are very sketchy at best.  Here they are, in no particular order:<br/><br/>1.  I see the potential patron (de Medici or whoever) as a sort of GM role, but I'm considering having it rotate \xc3\xa0 la Polaris or Shock: or somesuch.<br/><br/>2.  I need to incorporate some actual music into the game somehow!  Maybe not the details of compositions, but at least some sort of soundtrack.  (Where's that soundtrack thread?)<br/><br/>3.  I'm thinking 3-5 players.<br/><br/>4.  The game needs to be educational in some way about the time period, and needs to showcase all the research which I'm about to do for it.<br/><br/>5.  My answers to the Big Three:<br/><br/>a. The game is about the struggle to gain fame and recognition as a composer in 15th- and/or 16th-century Italian city-states.<br/><br/>b. The players (especially whatever GM-ish-type role I wind up with) attempt to recreate the feel of Renaissance political and religious conflict through appropriate narrative details, while challenging each other's characters, trying to prevent them from getting what they want.<br/><br/>c.  The characters, at least the composer characters, seek to earn notoriety as composers and performers, and a secure patronage, while avoiding censure from the Church or being caught up in political conflict (or plague, etc.).<br/><br/>(Arrgh.  I have no idea if that's any use at all.)<br/><br/>6.  I'm considering having some sort of "event card" mechanic, things like "plague" or "Papal visit to your city."  Maybe they could be ambiguous and interpretable \xc3\xa0 la Ganakagok.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/><br/>1.  Should I take the easy way out, and just design this game as a scenario for Burning Wheel (or another system, but I think BW's lifepaths would be helpful), and mainly focus on historically researching the characters, maybe statting out historical figures and putting them into (semi-fictionalized) conflict with one another?  (Regardless, I'm totally writing "Duel of Notes" mechanics lifted directly from the Duel of Wits.  Somehow, some way, I will make it work.)<br/><br/>2.  Can people suggest *one* or *two* games I should look into to help me, in terms of what I'm aiming for mechanically (although, I'm not even sure\xe2\u20ac\u201dsee question 3)?  I currently am at least familiar with (though don't necessarily own all of) the following: Polaris, Shock:, BW/BE, PTA, Mortal Coil, 1,001 Nights, TRoS, TSoY, DitV, Grey Ranks (and the Roach... ooh... the Roach comes to Renaissance Florence perhaps?), Beast Hunters, Conspiracy of Shadows, maybe one or two others I'm leaving out.  <br/><br/>2a. Would "My Life With Master" be a reasonable model for such a game, if instead of seeking out patronage, you start out with a patron, who makes you do horrible things / does horrible things to you?  My Life With Medicis?<br/><br/>3.  Which of the three G/N/S priorities should I emphasize here?  My instincts say Nar\xe2\u20ac\u201dthe Borgias will hire you to be their personal house composer, but only if you <i>murder your wife!</i>  But that might not fly well with my intended audience.  I could see it being competitive, in which case there's a non-rotating Patron role, and the other players are competing composers; in the end, only one will be chosen.  That might make it more like a boardgame, which is what my prof originally thought I meant.  Ha.  Little does he know... fools!  I will show them all!  Mwahaha... ahem.<br/><br/>4.  What should I call it?  "Grab the Lute!",  "Duel of Notes",  "Troubadour's Travails",  something Latin TBD (Intervalus Diabolicus?), "1,001 Florentine Nights" (some sort of 1,001 Nights hack might not be a bad idea, actually) are all ideas I've had, but they probably suck.  I don't know.  I need help!<br/><br/>5.  Should the characters maybe just be historical composers and patrons (and popes, etc), statted out?  I think going this route might be easier, but would also involve going more in the boardgame direction as noted above.<br/><br/>Please note: I do NOT expect to have a 100% complete game by mid-December, but I'd like to at least throw some mechanics together and begin playtesting, perhaps with my unsuspecting classmates.  And obviously the historical and musical research needs to be as solid as possible, but clearly that's not why I'm posting here.<br/><br/>Thanks all, for any help or insight you can offer!<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105490/#Comment_105490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T04:40:08+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  4:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.  Making it a hack seems like a good move since you have some time constraints.  I know you're a BW fanboy, but consider other options as well.  1001 Nights, as you mention.  TSOY.  The Roach.  There are lots of possibilities.<br/><br/>2.  Your list of possible references looks solid to me, given what you are going for.  That's a lot of diversity.  <br/><br/>3.  I wouldn't think about this at all, personally.  Just let it be what it is going to be.<br/><br/>4.  "Lute Warz!" obviously.<br/><br/>5.  I say yes to this - maybe look at Sons of Liberty for a model.  Don't make me invent a Florentine composer, just provide me with an interesting one I can learn from as I play.  In fact, consider making it a game for, say, 4 players, and having exactly four characters, all real people, all tightly bound together by relationship and obligation.  <br/><br/>Other thoughts - I think you need to inject situation somehow, as you note, through "event cards" or something similar.  I'd also consider designing for your audience (non-gamers, stodgy grad students), which makes me leery of BW as an initial engine.  Does the game need a facilitator, or can that be handled by rotating authority somehow, chained to a pre-set sequence of scenes?  It'll work better in a classroom without one, if you can manage it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105491/#Comment_105491" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T05:13:16+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  5:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suggestion for a title: Mecenate (italian, but was the same in the renaissance times), and it's your rich patron.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105514/#Comment_105514" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T08:05:38+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  8:05AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I'm thinking of Don't Rest Your Head, mainly because I like the core dice mechanic.  What I like about it is that it provides both a quick and clean method of scene resolution, but also gives you different "flavors" f success and failure -- you can win the scene cleanly, or in such a way that it makes other things worse or costs you resources.  <br/><br/>I guess I'm imagining a game where the composer-PC is trying to balance different goods -- the favor of his patron, the favor of the marketplace, pure musical invention (or, if you like, the favor of other composers) with each action.  <br/><br/>The thing from MLwM I'd really love to see in a game like this: the endgame, where you look up your character's fate on a table and then figure out how it applies.  I think it would be tremendous fun to discover that your character's music is immediately forgotten but he's remembered as somebody's enemy or lover (a la Salieri), or gets the music gets remade 500 years later into a pop single with synthesizer backup, or that he's actually made it into the canon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105526/#Comment_105526" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T09:26:47+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  9:26AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing that springs to my mind is a hack for Contenders, in a similar vein to Umlaut, if you've seen that. Players can try to earn reputation, money and patronage whilst at the same time avoiding notoriety or mediocrity. You could have concerts instead of fights.<br/><br/>You could introduce an educational aspect by having preset characters as real composers, detail their connections as real people (or perhaps have the connections replaced with their famous compositions, and provide a bit of detail) and so forth. Detail the setting a bit with some historical colour to provide a good, interesting context, and you're away!<br/><br/>The endgame could be as Danny suggests - all about their legacy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105527/#Comment_105527" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T09:29:48+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  9:29AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Duh, <i>Contenders </i>is an obvious choice.

Players not directly involved in the scene could form a chorus that could comment on the action, thereby adding helping dice or adversity/complications through their narration (GM could throw them a bone for providing complications that screw over the composer in fun and interesting ways). <br/><br/>Or maybe a 4 part <i>sonata cycle</i> could provide a structure (I think this is a late form, but oh well) with an allegro, exposition, adagio, coda scene structure.<br/><br/>Dice mechanic could also flavor scene narrations with music dynamics like Forte, Pianissimo, mezzo-forte, fortissimo, etc. So you could have a scene where you win the conflict, but have to narrate with Forte or with Fortissimo (I see this as how over the top and wacky you could be with the narration).<br/><br/>I haven't thought all this stuff through obviously, but I like the idea of Music as structural metaphor instead of story or narration as structural metaphor.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105819/#Comment_105819" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T21:57:52+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  9:57PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone.
