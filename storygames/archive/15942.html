On the other hand, what gamers we have tend to be well-versed in different games, and generally have a wide range in what they can get into, so usually we don't have any trouble forming a group. Over the recent years we've tended to play whatever I've had brewing, with players self-selecting in or out depending on whether they like that sort of thing. This is mostly because I'm one of like three adult gamers around here; the rest are highschoolers or young college students who naturally follow along. The teenagers play stuff like Warhammer, MtG, larps and some occasional tabletop roleplaying games when I'm not there leading the pack. There are a couple of people I get along with especially well and will generally ask to participate when I'm planning something new, but maybe two thirds of any given grouping will usually be formed of new or non-regular people. The typical game will last about half a dozen sessions, except for this D&amp;D thing we've been doing that'll apparently hit session 60 tomorrow.<br/><br/>Many of the local gamers have been trained by myself over the years, so I'm not surprised that their likings reflect my own to a degree; it's pretty common around here for people to appreciate many kinds of games as long as they're clearly explained and purposeful. On the other hand, these same folks tend to get impatient with vague games that involve a lot of exploration and reflecting upon what we're actually doing here right now. <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, for example, has a history of being a difficult game for this scene: the average GM who reads it and wants to run it usually hasn't really done more than setting up a plot of some sort, so it's tended to be a slow, mediocre experience with players uncertain about what they're supposed to be doing in the game.<br/><br/>Now that we've been playing D&amp;D I've had multiple people playing with us for whom D&amp;D is their best rpg experience ever; they clearly prefer the adventurous, challenge-focused, plotless, drama-less game over the range of more usual fare they've been familiar with from before. These also include several players who I think wouldn't be happy, or make others happy, in a drama-oriented game: D&amp;D has a much lower threshold of participation than many other games, so it suits guys who'd find it difficult to appreciate and participate in a game that relies more on literary stylings and a sense of narration. I've also had some people (well, one) opt out specifically because they don't like this sort of thing at all, and would rather play something more narrative and less character-death-y.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362715/#Comment_362715" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T12:15:08+00:00" title="February 26, 2012 12:15PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Different groups, different games.  <br/><br/>I have a "trad" group that plays D&amp;D (4e, Pathfinder, etc) and will occasionally let me experiment on them with "weird" games like Burning Wheel or Warhammer FRP 3rd ed or Marvel or whatever but those guys mostly don't care.

If he sent out a mass email saying, "Who wants to join me for some fiction-first Burning Wheel?", the people whose first love with that game is to manipulate its system would know to opt out.<br><br>"Indulge your creative side, make up lots of stuff" versus "control your character and nothing else" was another distinction that I felt attracted different folks, and also led me to invite different folks to different games.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362747/#Comment_362747" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T13:41:08+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  1:41PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David">@David</a> Berg<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's a typical example of "manipulating the system" (as play goal) the way you're defining it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362749/#Comment_362749" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T13:46:04+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  1:46PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite><br><br>Can you talk (in general terms) about who is/isn't suited to what games or kinds of games and why?<br><br>Like I have some people who are too ADD for Cthulhu the way I run it.

It's kind of like the example you're giving there.<br>I find that there are two metrics that often crop up in determining who to invite to a game.<br><br>The first is subject seriousness.<br>Some people feel like Perfect Unrevised or Penny For My Thoughts are too serious and somber. They ask, "Why would something so sad and grim be fun for me?"<br>Other people feel like Danger Patrol is too goofy and shallow. They ask, "How is this a meaningful story?"<br><br/>So, I don't invite silly people to serious games, or serious people to silly games. I mean, I do once or twice, to give them an opportunity to explore a new opportunity. But once it's clear a game tone isn't right for them, I stop trying to make that match.<br/><br/>The other one is rules complexity.<br/>I have some friends who love telling stories, but complicated dice and tactics are too much for them. For some friends, the complexity limit is about that of Microscope. For others, the limit is around In a Wicked Age. For others, it's around Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>I don't invite people to games that will overload them, wrt complexity. I don't happen to have any friends who have a minimum required complexity, but I have in the past.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362751/#Comment_362751" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T13:48:12+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  1:48PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Every single time I want to play a session of a roleplaying game, I hand-pick who to play with based on schedule logistics and who'd be interested/suited to the game that's desired.</blockquote>\nThis shit would drive me FUCKING CRAZY.

The point isn't to game but to hangout. Often this is grounded in nostalgia. We don't love playing using the rules of Marvel FASERIP or Shadowrun but we love those games (it's less rational, more emotional). So we will hack those games, keeping the nostalgia, but blending in techniques from new games (not just from other RPGs but also video games and boardgames).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to all watch movies together but now it's nearly impossible to get 12+ people to all agree on what movie to watch. But with RPGs (and this specific group), we'll hack them on the fly to keep the group together.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nI also play a lot of games with a lot of different people. I helped build a local gaming community partially to have a greater variety of people to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften when I want to play a very specific game, I'll email a 100+ people saying\u2026 "who wants to play X game on Y date?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis usually means I don't play long term games. These aren't strangers. These are all people I care about and to play a campaign means playing with less people, so I stick to 1-3 shots to game with as many quality people (quality being non-universal, subjective and personal) as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother but\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nOften I'm friends with all these people but they aren't always friends with each other. At least not yet. So it's even more helpful to give people information to self-select. I don't believe in universal fun. One size doesn't fit all. So when reaching out I like to set expectations asap.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, I would say 1/3rd of the time (sometimes 1/2) I'm in the mood for a very specific game. This almost always means I don't play that game with my high school friends (at least not all of them as a group).<br/>\n<br/>\nI occasionally play with groups with mixed preferences. Sometimes it's amazing. Sometimes it's terrible. Often it means I have to do more work as GM (I generally prefer to GM) to make it socially work. So I try to go with what's less work. Or at least I prioritize the work I have to do by what brings me the highest return of fun on my investment of effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362812/#Comment_362812" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T21:14:31+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  9:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pretty much play with the same group of people all the time.

Another guy and I in the group are interested in indie games, but we've learned we can't pitch them for the standard Saturday night session, because people want D&amp;D (or something like it) for that night.  We had a 9 player session of Fiasco on a weeknight that was a lot of fun, but it would never sell for the normal bi-weekly session.<br><br>I still pitch them indie games, but I do so lightly and irregularly.

Or are the differences between the groups just down to logistics?</blockquote>\nTailored? Kind of. I have something like four "pools" of people I tend to play with.<br><br>One pool consists of people in a weekly group that usually plays D&amp;D and Pathfinder. The group started from a message in a local Meetup group for people interested in D&amp;D, and that kind of game is their primary interest (though some of them also like Savage Worlds and they've enjoyed it when I've run InSpectres and Don't Rest Your Head for them). <br><br>Another pool is made up of people from a group I LARP with locally, pretty much exclusively World of Darkness stuff. These folks are all part of what was until recently White Wolf's official fan club. It's a big group and people come and go from it frequently, but it's fair to say that most of the ones who stay are into the games (though I'm sure for a minority of them it may be more of a logistics issue - this is the only game they know of going on at the time they can play, this is the one game with room for more players that their friends are playing, etc.).<br><br>The other two pools are ones I don't get to see as often, consisting largely of folks who live farther away from me and whom I primarily play with once every month or every other month at somebody's house or at a convention. Those two pools, who are basically 1) people who live on the other side of town and 2) people who live out of town but I see at conventions, share a decent number of members between them, but still have enough different people in them that they can be considered distinct from each other. In those cases, we more often than not play Savage Worlds, which most of the people in those groups enjoy quite a lot. The rest of the time we play a number of different games both "traditional" and "indie" which for the most part are things I think work fairly well for those groups.<br><br>Whenever I try to run games of my own, I usually pull from three of those four pools (the three that are local), mixing and matching as needed to get the numbers I'm looking for. Because of that, in these cases whether the game fits the group isn't really a consideration, taking a back seat to the question of who's available. I'd say the people who show up probably fit the games better than the ones who decide not to come because they're not familiar with the game in question.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Do you have certain people in your group that you know have certain preferences?</blockquote>\nYes, very much so. I can sometimes use that to help figure out who to ask when I'm recruiting for games I run (though to be honest, my primary qualifying question is "Do I enjoy playing games with this person?" or at the very least "Do I get along with this person?").                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362842/#Comment_362842" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T01:19:23+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  1:19AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Do you play all the RPGs you play with the same group of people or do you play different ones with different groups?</blockquote>\nDifferent games, different people.<br/><br/>Currently I'm running three games. One player (my significant other) plays in all of them. Two players play in two of them. The other nine in one game each.\n<blockquote>Do you feel the games are tailored to the groups? Or are the differences between the groups just down to logistics?</blockquote>\nBoth. Some people have broader tastes, some narrower. A lot of it is logistics as well. Knowing lots of gamers and wanting to play games with many of them has an effect too: not logistics per se, but desire to socialize with more people.\n<blockquote>Do you have certain people in your group that you know have certain preferences?</blockquote>\nYes.<br/><br/>I don't know nearly everyone's preferences, though: there's 70+ people in my facebook "Gamers" list, most of them local and all of them meatspace friends and acquaintances. I played tabletop with maybe half of them, more if you include larps. When I'm looking for players unless I already have specific people in mind I message that list and let them know.<br/><br/>Some people I know <i>really</i> like certain stuff. Some people I know <i>really</i> hate certain stuff. Some people have fairly narrow tastes but are willing to experiment. Some haven't played very much and think they have narrow tastes, but just haven't discovered how different games can be cool. Some people I <i>think</i> belong to the previous group, but really do have very narrow tastes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/juliusz" title="juliusz"><img alt="juliusz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/juliusz">juliusz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363311/#Comment_363311" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T07:45:31+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  7:45AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're doing this mostly on a person-by-person basis.<br/><br/>I have kind of mental map of current gaming preferences of people around me, based mostly on what follows:<br/><br/>playtesting or not<br/>high vs low points of contact<br/>Norwegian-style games are cool vs "yeah well, but maybe rather this other thing"<br/>games with lots of RPG-related tropes or references to various games older than 10 years vs no history-of-the-hobby-including-D&amp;D-and-WW-related baggage<br/>people from my close gaming circle vs random people from local fandom / internet<br/>one-shot vs few sessions<br/>preferred agenda<br/>amount of free time next month<br/><br/>Most of people including me drift between these categories; usually, there are at least 2 persons in each of these, often more. So in practice it's categorical "no" that matters - there are people who are totally not interested in, say, gamist play or OSR-related stuff - it kinda makes for the core of the groups for different types of games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363321/#Comment_363321" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T08:04:48+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  8:04AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got one group for all of my games, and they don't like the games I like, so now I don't have a group at all.<br/><br/>I could probably find a new group if I tried, but I don't know many people here and meeting new people is <i>terrible</i>!<br/><br/>Plus, I might just suck at these games, making all of the effort wasted and pointless.

There are people who I know I can play Burning Wheel with but others who I know would be more into PTA and plenty of folks who would play both.  I tend to be the person who wrangles people into a game and I choose the game based on the group...kind of.  More like I get a game and think, "Oooh, this would be perfect for Barry, JJ, KK and Padraic.  They'd love this shit."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Do you feel the games are tailored to the groups? Or are the differences between the groups just down to logistics?</blockquote>\nYes, I do feel the games are tailored but there are logistical things going on too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Do you have certain people in your group that you know have certain preferences?</blockquote>\nYeah, definitely.  I know Jim wouldn't like Primetime Adventures because its not crunchy and/or fiddely enough for him but I know that he'd love Marvel Heroic Role-Playing.  I'd love for Jim to have played in our Burning Wheel games but I know how busy his personal life is and that the night we played wouldn't have worked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363361/#Comment_363361" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T10:00:05+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 10:00AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play different games with different groups. There's a big enough community in NYC (which man is so awesome) that I will often enough end up with friends and friends of friends whom I haven't yet met, and we'll organize a game and play for a while based on what the group likes. Sometimes that means it's a game I'm not totally into, and so that's a game I don't play.<br/><br/>Among my closer friends, I'm pretty keen on what they do and don't like, so there's occasionally some tailoring depending on whether I really want a) to play with specific people or b) to play a specific game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
