I came up with a few ideas in the couple of days beforehand. I went with a basic demon that manifests as a mouth in the back of another girl's head which uses hair tentacles to drag kids in and eat them. So far so good.<br/><br/>I wrote out some basic sheets to help people keep track of the elemental dice and what they could be used for, because I knew that would be the slowest thing for me to look up and remember, and I'd need to advise the players on how to allocate the dice on the fly. I also to the opportunity to note down the 5 parts of scene setting for reference.<br/><br/>The game itself went... okay. I came across 2 main issues with running Panty Explosion that day, both of which I feel I can address relatively easily. The first one was simple: the pre-generated character sheets which Brian downloaded from the website aren't really PDFs, but rather images which have been placed in a PDF. As such, they are grainy and, on the whole, very difficult to read. The players had to come to a concensus on what one of the characters was called by referencing the other sheets, and one of them seemed to have the hobby "Sgnoles" (about 10 minutes from the end we realised it said "smokes"). This just caused a lot of distractions, so I'm thinking of taking the sheets, deciphering them and making proper PDFs out of them.<br/><br/>The other thing which could have been done better was my explanation of agendas. I was running the game off the cuff, and I guess I didn't realise just how important the agendas are. They actually drive the whole game - nothing happens in a scene unless either the GM specifically says so or the players want to resolve an agenda. This was only sort of explained in the rulebook, and I only realised that after a scene or 2 had stalled.<br/><br/>Because of that, the players hadn't really resolved any agendas by the time we had to move to the final scene with the demon (killed with a golf club). On the other hand, we totally had the hang of the rival/best friend narration structure, which rocked and everyone enjoyed it. We decided that all of the agendas were resolved by the end of the game, which was cool.<br/><br/>One other point: the elements are very all encompassing things, and the descriptions of them in the book cover a pretty big range of aspects of them. This does make it hard to decide quickly in the course of a short game what to do with your dice. Attacking is a fire things, sure, but talking someone into something? There are elements to cover all stuff, but it would be nice to have a few easy keywords for some of them. Water especially is a bit diverse, so breaking it down to something like "Flexibility and Emotions" might help, and to be honest, if that doesn't cover the whole thing it shouldn't matter as the game will be quick enough it won't cover a lot of ground.<br/><br/>So, for future reference, my advice for running Panty Explosion is to focus on the agendas, make the character sheets clear, and give simpler explanations of the elements.<br/><br/>Shevaun<br/><br/><i><a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com" rel="nofollow">Cross-posted with Collective Endeavour</a></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105635/#Comment_105635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T06:18:35+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  6:18AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting so quickly Shevy.<br/><br/>Jake, Matt: any chance of getting the fuzzy writing fixed on the downloads?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106468/#Comment_106468" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T01:57:00+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  1:57AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Shevaun! I totally missed this. Thanks for running PE. thanks tons! Glad you had fun. <br/><br/>The grainy character sheets suck. Sorry. I'm actually in the middle of updating the ones for Classroom Deathmatch, and I'll make sure to do the ones for Panty Explosion as well. They should be up on our site late next week.<br/><br/>Agendas are central to Panty Explosion. The whole game is about agendas. But it's becoming clear to me that this isn't as clear as I thought it was. We'll be adding a little bit addressing this to the next printing of the book. This will mean another round of free PDFs for everyone, which is always fun.<br/><br/>Thanks!!!<br/><br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106485/#Comment_106485" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T05:59:37+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  5:59AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whee!
