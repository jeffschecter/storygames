All those D&amp;D sacred cows are so much bullshit, I don't even know how this could break the game. Some awkwardly thinking individual sometime in the '70s or whatever thought to start comparing character classes in an armchair theory way, and therein grew a completely unrealistic model of class balance comparison that relied on these types of details as supposed balancing mechanisms. For some reason most people will gladly agree that say the Paladin code or the high ability prerequisites Rangers get are bullshit balance measures, but everybody seems to think that the sky will fall if everybody can use whatever weapons they can lift in the fiction.<br/><br/>(The above does not consider people who oppose lifting weapon restrictions for some other reason aside from game "balance". For example, it's not an insane argument to say that the various restrictions help differentiate between classes, which supports the game's idea of specialization. I happen to think that this is not needed when you give the classes some nice positive class abilities, but there is an argument there.)<br/><br/>Of course, later editions of the game have grown around these types of D&amp;D arcana (quick, somebody give this a snazzy name, I want to use it in my book - "Dungeonica"?) like a tree grows around a rock, so I'm sure that 3rd and 4th editions would have real and definite balance issues if you just removed these limitations without doing anything to rebalance. Of course 3rd edition balance is a joke to begin with, so maybe 4th is the only real problem.<br/><br/>In our campaign the only reason to not use plate mail is if you need to be that much more nimble, light, or comfortable, or if you can't afford it. The world is a cruel place, the guys with the thousand silver guildens that it takes to buy a full panoply are head and shoulders above others, experience level be damned. Even those who can afford it do get into situations where they don't want to use a plate mail, though: wizard types don't want to buy it because they have other money sinks, and they don't want to wear it while doing ritual magic due to the comfort penalties. Nobody wants to wear it while swimming or jumping or climbing or just running. Nobody wants to wear it while sleeping. If what you do often involves those things, or you suspect that those'll be a feature in the next adventure, you leave the plate at home.<br/><br/>The methodical answer to this whole plate mail thing is to look at the fiction and draw on your understanding of medieval armouring, and push, push, push appropriate mechanics and subgames until the fiction starts to pleasingly approximate your vision. Doesn't take too long, and the longer you stick to it the better your local application will be. For example, I'm considering doubling most of the various armour penalties in our campaign to further emphasize the awkwardness of plate mail in certain situations; I also make a point of the time it takes to don or undress it, so the characters have to actually think about whether to wear it or not. I consider myself successful when armor is no longer a fetishistic identity statement like it is in modern D&amp;D (you pick a type of armor that your character always wears as part of his official ensemble), but rather a tool you use or don't use depending on the situation. Character class only enters into this in that Fighters are usually more adept at using armor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366010/#Comment_366010" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T11:39:12+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 11:39AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just what wizards need, something to make them more powerful. :-/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366017/#Comment_366017" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T11:56:52+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 11:56AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In True20, Adapts have no armor restrictions.

I started the players off dirt poor and I was somewhat stingy with loot, because I wanted the need for cash to be one of the driving forces of the game. Over the course of several adventures, the players never got to the point where paying for room and board wasn't a meaningful expense. Their armor upgrades came from looting (I'd generally rule that they could grab about half the armor from the defeated enemies - the other half was too broken up by them killing the enemies to be useful), plus I made them pay some cash to get things refit and to maintain them.<br/><br/>Sure, not everyone wants to do a campaign that way. But if you're playing a game that's "too heroic" to worry about realistic cashflow, then why would you be asking the question of whether wizards should be able to wear armor anyway?<br/><br/>Oh, and I tweaked the way armor worked in Savage Worlds - I gave it an armor bonus, but also a negative of about half the points that was applied to spellcasting, swimming, climbing, riding, and a couple other things. Better quality - more expensive - armor had a lower negative. The players thought it was balanced and easy to work with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366028/#Comment_366028" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T12:22:39+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 12:22PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally I prefer my wizards lightly armored, but is something else game-breaking?

I couldn't make it work, either, when I tried it with a bottomless trashcan and a David Copperfield biography. What you need to realize, however, is that D&amp;D is a <i>fantasy</i> game; it's totally unreasonable to expect fantasy wizards to be realistic like that. Heck, I don't see D&amp;D demanding that fighters <i>die</i> when they jump off a ten-story building, so I should think that this wizard-armor thing would be well within suspension of disbelief. In fact, thinking about it, I don't see too much Cleaving going on in the real, realistic world, either, so holding D&amp;D to the standards of realism on this one point seems entirely unwarranted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366049/#Comment_366049" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T13:05:24+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  1:05PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin,<br/>Your point is well taken, but relies on the presumption that casting spells requires upper-body flexibility and precise hand gestures. I mean, yeah, AD&amp;D2e made this more explicitly part of the mechanics by listing verbal, somatic, and material components for each spell.<br/><br/>I think that Lamentations has the right idea (which Eero alluded to): make more fighty characters better at fighting, rather than making less fighty characters even worse at it. <br/>One solution, regarding spell mechanics themselves, could be to divvy up spells into combat-ready and ritual-style. 3e sort of hinted at this approach with the whole "take 10" and "take 20" idea. <br/>For that matter, it could be cool to have MUs spend time "locking" their spells into gear they're carrying, instead of memorizing them, so that then you can make 1-shot wands or baubles or something - - it'd still sharply constrain the utility of magic but in a way that clarifies how magic works, rather than keeping up the poor illusion that we currently understand what magic is. <br/>And such "locked" items would be more like baby wands or baby magic items, which would make the whole "wand-charges" thing fit in with the overall magic system more smoothly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366057/#Comment_366057" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T13:35:41+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  1:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is terribly edition-dependent.<br/>In low-level Mentzer/Moldvay (that is, the Basic set), for example, there is no difference in to-hit ability between a lev. 1-3 Fighther and a lev. 1-3 Magic User: thus, the greater combat attitude of Fighters in such a situation is entirely predicated on having more HPs and broader armament options. In Basic, then, the ability to wear chainmail and plate armor is a distinguishing class feature of Fighters, Clerics and the Demi-humans (also fighter-ish classes) and giving such ability to Magic Users and/or Thieves would significantly dilute the appeal of those other classes. Different flavors of OD&amp;D, AD&amp;D or different tiers in BXCMI may vary on this, though, especially depending on the mix of character classes involved.<br/>On the other hand, in about 10-yrs playing D&amp;D 3.x I've seen very little PCs use heavy armor at all, because those were only useful to low-dexterity characters, while most fighter-types had a number of incentives to not dump their dexterity score. Medium-weight armors were all the rage, and most armor-using PCs wore a breast-plate (the "best" medium armor in 3.x), with exotic-material breast-plates (mithril, etc.) being highly sought after. Rogues, 3.5 rangers and the like used either masterwork studded-leather suits or mithril chain-shirts; strictly no-armor classes could easily pick up armor proficiency feats, but nobody I've met IRL ever bothered with those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366058/#Comment_366058" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T13:41:16+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  1:41PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 1:42PM by Krippler.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's an aestethic choice not in how your character dress up but rather how scary it is to be in a melee.

The +8 to AC from plate armor is nice, but if you want to pump AC you can make a staff wizard (+1 to AC), get your INT up high (which you want anyway), and spend a feat on either leather armor proficiency or Unarmored Agility to get another +2 AC, which can get you up to 18 AC, which means you've reached the same AC as a typical fighter at 1st level, albeit by building heavily in that direction and passing up some other good stuff.<br/><br/>But anyway.<br/><br/>I never saw the point of limiting magic to the scrawny guy who runs around in robes.

I'll give you later editions - no reason whatsoever for a sane roleplayer to go for them if the fantasy stylings don't match your vision, except perhaps the skirmish rules in 4th edition are pretty sleek in their own right. With the oldest editions, though, there are things going on there below the surface that are not satisfyingly provided by any other game. I specifically wouldn't know what to replace the D&amp;D methodological framework with if we for some reason decided that our only recourse to having wizards spell-casting in armor was to quit D&amp;D for something else. Perhaps <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i>, I suppose.<br/><br/>(Ironically the casting-in-armor thing is in actual fact moot in our campaign. I've toned the wizardly magic down so far that it's a miracle the players manage to cast spells at all outside a ritualized context. Still, armor technically doesn't interfere in the matter as long as the wizard doesn't need to e.g. do something dextrous with gloves on or whatever - you have to establish a concrete fictional reason for the armor to be a problem before it becomes one, not the other way around.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366115/#Comment_366115" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T17:06:17+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  5:06PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pulp Poet</cite>It is game breaking in 4th edition if you just give it to them, because the defenses of various classes are ostensibly balanced against each other.

I thought there was a "mage armor" buff of that type, but I couldn't remember the specifics.<br/><br/>There is fallout from this, mostly magic item lists and such. Light armor is more beneficial to wizards than heavy.  Fairly easy to tweak.  Though, I'd say that last AC point is a pretty big one as most of the classes get pretty close and can make or break the "mostly hit/mostly whiff" factor. And like third, there are some classes that can feel like a wizard, but are meant to be more in the thick of things, that would fit the style better (like the sword mages or whatever they call it from the Forgotten Realms book - although I think they have some kind of magic armor buff too). But it's not game breaking in a way that would bother most people, but that difference if big enough that it has the game designer in me climbing out onto a ledge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366126/#Comment_366126" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T18:07:50+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:07PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm pretty sure that the worst thing about it would be that there would be plate armor with wizard enchantments on it, so other plate users would have a harder time finding enchantments that fir their role.</p>\n<p>By setting up each cluster of related classes with a different armor tier, it's possible to avoid this gear dilution effect somewhat.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sbszine" title="sbszine"><img alt="sbszine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/471/nTYPQ57XSGLLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sbszine">sbszine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366137/#Comment_366137" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T19:34:51+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  7:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Letting wizards use whatever armour and weapons works OK in 2E where they miss out on weapon specialisation.

There's the game balance part, and there's the fictional verisimilitude part.<br/><br/><b>Game Balance</b><br/><br/>Presumably, wizards have a bunch of other cool things that make up for living with a shitty armor class. There's a trade-off. 3E and 4E designers actually tried to make the classes balanced against each other, so changing this willy-nilly fucks with the order of the universe. So if you're gonna give wizards a better AC, you can either ignore the change in game balance or you can add some kind of cost that makes sense and can't easily be circumvented by clever players.<br/><br/>Then again, look at Basic D&amp;D where fucking-elves get to wear any armor they want, and cast the same spells magic-users can cast. Somehow, that didn't break the game. Elves advanced much slower than everyone else, though, and you had to roll good ability scores to qualify (remember random ability score generation?).<br/><br/><b>Verisimilitude</b><br/><br/>Most of the wizards in the books we read and the movies we watch don't wear armor. If they did, they'd be spellcasting warriors, not wizards, right? If you don't care, then there's no issue. You're gonna let the rogues wear plate, too, right? While you're at it, let the clerics fight with swords and bows.<br/><br/>There's really no reason to break the spell, though. You can give mages a better armor class without giving them armor. Give them some kind of AC bonus that increases with their level. Call it their preternatural ability to deflect blows, like Jedi waving their hands around and flinging opponents hither and thither. That's pretty bad-ass. More bad-ass than wearing fucking plate, lemme tell you. And then the constricting leather and the proximity of all that metal doesn't interfere with their arcane juju, or whatever stupid explanation the book give to justify the game balance thing mentioned above. <br/><br/>Why don't wizards wear plate? Because they can snap their fingers and push your sword away from their soft, pale flesh, muddafudda. Also, because they only have 2 gerdanged hit points and it's hard to run away in plate when you only have a 7 Strength and 9 Constitution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366154/#Comment_366154" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T21:44:34+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:44PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Give them some kind of AC bonus that increases with their level.

D&amp;D has a tendency to be weirdly stingy with magic, in that magical effects are often discrete, sharply defined effects. More "loose" or "ambient" magic is always a nice addition to the game; things like giant mushrooms and talking castles add a certain wonder or whimsy to the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366156/#Comment_366156" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T21:58:10+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:58PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is seriously muscling-in on the elf's racket.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366159/#Comment_366159" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T22:14:49+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 10:14PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe the elf just does it with weapons, rather than psi-power?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366162/#Comment_366162" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T22:54:53+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 10:54PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wearing plate mail (let's not even get into full-plate suits) in the dungeon is like driving a tank in the jungle: sure, you can do it, but you'll get hung up on the terrain and slowed down, you'll make so much noise everyone will hear you coming from miles off, and you'll just get targeted and ambushed, negating the supposed value of the extra protection.

Vances's later Dying Earth books used a slightly different model for magic - recalcitrant entities called sandestins performed the hard labour and spells were rationed narratively through an obscure currency called indenture points.<br/><br/>Can anyone think of a magician from heroic fantasy who wears plate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366221/#Comment_366221" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T09:00:30+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  9:00AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2012 9:01AM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elric?<br/>edit: ... this makes the case for summonings and for lengthy rituals as a type of magic OK for elves and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366237/#Comment_366237" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T09:32:24+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  9:32AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2012 9:37AM by ccreitz.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I'm pretty sure that the worst thing about it would be that there would be plate armor with wizard enchantments on it, so other plate users would have a harder time finding enchantments that fir their role.By setting up each cluster of related classes with a different armor tier, it's possible to avoid this gear dilution effect somewhat.</blockquote> There is a lot to be said for this, too.

Then they take it off. Cause it sucks to wear it all day. I have yet to see/hear of a person who would consistantly wear it for 16 hour stretches. I'm sure someone out there can point out an example or two of someone who does. But they're outliers. The vast vast majority of plate armor enthusiasts wear it for part of a day at most.<br/><br/>Medium armors - chain, brig, maybe plate+mail at most - are SOOOO much more comfortable to wear for extended periods. And yes, I know about the whole "you don't need a winch to mount a horse like the stupid Henry V movie shows" thing. But still, wearing full plate all day every day would be the equivilant of wearing a full bomb squad suit constantly. Nobody does that. You only put that suit on for special circumstances. Much more practical to wear a plated kevlar vest and helmet for extended periods, as many of our modern soldiers do.<br/><br/>So I prefer when systems add escalating negatives to super heavy armor wearing, so that light and medium armors make sense mechanically for everyone, including Fighters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366257/#Comment_366257" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T10:08:37+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 10:08AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Couples with two like-build rogues are always fighting over<i>rings of free action</i>and silk ropes, and it seems like a silly thing, but always having that stress in your relationship is bad for it.</blockquote>\nI don't think the rogue couples are really <i>fighting</i> over silk ropes, so much as intententionally building tension.

In the end, best to leave that stuff to the pros.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I think that spell failure is a more important thing to model, at least somewhat realistically, than falling, is that anyone can fall.

So a game designed to tell the kinds of stories thy bards sing might well choose to treat drowning or falling a little cinematically, while paying a little more attention to disarming traps or casting spells in some kind of ludicrous steel chaps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366350/#Comment_366350" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T17:15:10+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  5:15PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>What I'm getting here, mostly, is that it isn't bad if wizards can wear plate but have all kinds of incentives not to wear plate.

Is that about right?</blockquote>\nI think that's a fine course to take. The idea that magic doesn't like armour because metal interferes with the magical energies is just interesting, I remember how it seemed exciting to teenager-me in MERP for how it complicated the life of a wizard who wished to don arms.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is often very abbreviated and sparse in how it maps things into the fiction. One might easily imagine a game text that gave D&amp;D's armour limitation and mapped it into the fiction by e.g. saying that you can't cast spells in armor or a wizard's dick drops off if he dons metal or wizards are magnetic and thus repulse metal so that you literally physically can't wear metal armor. I think that'd make all the difference, as then it would be easy to picture what is going on in the fiction, and to map some specialty situations like what happens if my wizard disguises himself as a knight by wearing plate mail, or whatever. It's the lack of fictional mapping that's so offensive, it's much easier to take that limitation if it has a reason and is not just an arbitrary mechanical limit. And if the fictional justification rings false and ridiculous to you - well, perhaps that's a sign of something, maybe that original limitation wasn't that good an idea?<br/><br/>Even further, instead of a limitation we can just put in a penalty. Penalties are better than limitations for many things because they cause conditional limitations: in this situation it is not feasible for me to wear armor, but in this other situation it is, and it's up to my skill to perceive which it is. In this way it's so much more sensible to say that a wizard can wear armor, he just can't cast spells while in it. Or he can cast spells, but he needs to make an extra check of some sort. In general, I'm much in favour of game structures that force players to make choices in the game instead of pre-game: don't choose whether your character is a fighter or a wizard and dress accordingly, but rather learn of the situation at hand and dress accordingly. One of these is a character-building choice, the other is a fictional positioning choice. Entirely different things, and I can't say I care much for the character-building choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Even further, instead of a limitation we can just put in a penalty. Penalties are better than limitations for many things because they cause conditional limitations: in this situation it is not feasible for me to wear armor, but in this other situation it is, and it's up to my skill to perceive which it is.</blockquote>\nDungeon World handles this in an interesting way: by giving each class its own encumbrance limit, combined with how much gear a given class needs to "work", you can steer people gently away from bucking tradition, but in a way that doesn't just limit your options.<br/>When it comes to wizards and weapon choices, all weapons wielded by a magic-user do 1d4 damage (plus any relevant mods). It basically frees you up to experiment more with your character's Color, and thus get a chance to better "interpret" the character and get to know it better. Maybe wizards just use lighter, more elegant versions of conventional weapons? Maybe they just don't have the training to hit as hard as professional soldiers can? It kind of leaves room for interpretation, since you can mix and match class and weapon as you like. <br/><br/>Ironically, 3e D&amp;D tried to capture this "interpretive" attitude of mixing and matching character elements, but they went about it incorrectly: if every PC race can be paired up with any class you want, then the theme and color and I guess the "tone" of the PC race choices is diluted. When you put limitations there, at the first stages of character creation, you can guide people into certain genre conventions. Elves can't be clerics, so maybe they don't have organized religion. Dwarves can't be wizards, so I guess they can only do magic if the gods are involved. And for some reason, neither elves nor dwarves can specialize in criminal activity. What's up with that? It kind of implies that only humans and halflings actually live in towns or cities, where theft could be a specialized skill. <br/><br/>Conversely, when you take limits off what items characters can actually use in play, you can much more effectively customize your character - - rather than trying to "build" your character correctly, which stifles your creative options down the road for fear of "breaking the build" - - by changing how you see your character after a particular experience or the acquisition of a particular item.<br/><br/>Picture having a wizard who finds a dark, scary runesword with a couple of cool powers. Sure, he can only swing it for d4+2 damage, but it's cool as hell and can cast <i>darkness</i> and <i>lightning bolt</i>, so what's not to love?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366368/#Comment_366368" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T19:42:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  7:42PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play a variety of OSR games.

Just make it up!<br/><br/>If it doesn't work, do something else.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about later editions of D&amp;D--I no longer play them.

Actually, last adventure I was the one that didn't wear armour (although I did have a big shield) and making it necessary for everyone to have something equivalent to armour significantly added to the verisimilitude of being shot at with arrows. Arrows are *fucking scary*. Especially when they are in your thigh and you're not sure if they missed a major artery yet. Experiences like these make a person want to acquire armour quickly.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you can do it however you want narrative-wise and it would be problematic to do it in DnD mostly because of how DnD's mechanics work and for no other reason.

Perhaps showing the process of evolution you can take to a character class will be educational.)<br/><br/>You guys have D&amp;D-itis, and it's making you sell the fighter short. That plate armor is <i>meaningless</i>, it's not where his core competency lies. By saying that you can't give the wizard armor because then he's as good as the fighter you're saying that the fighter is a wimp who's only got more metal on him than the next guy. There is nothing preventing you from stacking the deck in the favour of the fighter to whatever ridiculous degree you want.<br/><br/>For example, in our campaign:<ul><li>Initiative is important in a fight. You can expend Initiative to take extra actions in a fight, or you can spend it in reactive actions (blocking with shields, dodging, etc.). Have your Initiative lowered below zero and you're <i>confused</i>, which is a dangerous state to be. Fighters get a bonus equal to level to Initiative, and they're eligible for sick specializations that further ensure that they will be acting first and acting often.</li><li>Attack checks are like you'd expect in D&amp;D, with an attack bonus against AC, with a d20 involved. Roll well enough and you're getting <i>stunts</i>, which can range from your usual disarms and trips to outright save or die with sufficiently high rolls. Only Fighters get experience bonuses to attack rolls.</li><li>All weapons do d6 damage, unless they're off-scale and cause multiple dice of damage, or they're wimpy (not intended for killing people, basically) and they do something like d3. The feasible way over this is by boosting your attack roll, above, but if you're a Fighter you can acclimatize to special fighting styles (basically, styles intended against inhuman targets that don't reliably go down on that single d6 when hit) that enable you to use a bigger damage die by default.</li><li>Everybody's hit dice are d6, unless you've got consumption and they're d4. You reroll your hitpoints after every long rest. Most Fighters will be Tough, meaning that they roll their hit points on d8 and retain the better of their roll or their prior points when resting. This means that your typical mid-level Fighter will have well over double the longevity of anybody else in a fight-or-equivalent, provided they've had a few days of rest. They need 10 minutes to reroll their hit points after a fight, by the way, so multiple skirmishes do not exactly blunt the effectiveness.</li><li>Fighting is a chaotic process, especially in a dungeon; you will often not know what you fight, how many there are or actually anything else, including where you are or where your allies are. Most Fighters will be Tactical, meaning that they do not need to waste combat rounds keeping track of what is happening.</li></ul>\nThe above is the result of a completely ordinary process of houseruling on the D&amp;D chassis - it's an entirely legitimate way of running the (old-school version of the) game, in other words. Sticking a mage into a plate mail is basically completely irrelevant next to this series of consistent violence-related supremacy the Fighter is bringing to bear. Heck, if the Fighter really wants, I'll give him a +2 to AC for just plain being more skilled in using his armor. This entire combat-based comparison between character classes is not going to <i>matter</i>, because we are talking about several arenas of conflict, one of which is basically the rightful expertise of this other character class over here. Putting artificial restrictions on a wizard to balance him in a fight is ridiculous: if he want to win the fight, he's going to have to do it with magic or something, as he's not going to be significant on the level the Fighter operates in anyway after a few experience levels.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: if your fighter is going to be irrelevant because of some armor on the wizard, then you need to be adding some flavourful, sensible mechanical leverage for the fighter. Continue doing that until you're happy with the level of dominance a life dedicated to violence affords to the guy - depends on your aesthetic when you stop. I could see a more minimalistic take where everybody's basically as good in a fight as the next guy, but then I'd remove the Fighter character class altogether, too.<br/><br/>Note that the above does not comment upon whether the Fighter's many advantages are <i>relevant</i> or <i>balanced</i> against advantages other types of characters have in different venues of conflict. The whole point of the game is to discover whether it matters for shit that your character is the toughest swordsman between here and Naples. Maybe it doesn't matter, because nothing important will be resolved by fighting. (This seems to be the case in 3rd edition D&amp;D by the book, by the way - fighting competence matters for shit because the world is full of magic that trumps violence on a strategic level.) Not up to me as the GM, not up to the game designer - the play will carry out whatever truth about the real nature of power. If you think that the wizard getting plate mail makes the fighter redundant, feel free to play a wizard instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367305/#Comment_367305" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T17:10:32+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  5:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2012 5:21PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>Plate was superior<i>in every possible way</i>.</blockquote>\nOne little knit to pick. Chain is better at heat dispersion/retension. Plate sucks more heat away in the winter and absorbs more heat in the summer. (edit: these observations are based on what I've seen at ren faires and larp, so it's based on people using chain and plate made from the same basic metal - usually stainless steel. The guys in plate complain about heat in the summer and cold in the winter. The guys in chain don't. Some of it seems to have to do with breathability/airflow. Some seems to have to do with what they're wearing under the armor - it seems to be much easier to adjust other layers to the weather when in chain.)<br/><br/>Also, chain is far more comfortable to sit down in for hours at a time. If I were on guard duty (real guard duty, not some silly beefeater honor guard gig), or off "adventuring", or doing anything else rather than preparing for an army battle, I'd rather be in chain. When I know an army battle is coming, I'd happily put plate on for it, for the improved protection.<br/><br/>Also, chain is good at protecting certain parts of the body that are difficult to protect in plate. Like armpits and the insides of elbows.<br/><br/>A personal favorite of historical armor is wisby plate, which is like a combination of brig and lorica segmentata. It has overlapping plates inside of a suit of leather.

When they're on the inside, they're being held in place better between the leather and the body - you don't have to be as detailed and fancy about the attaching methods. Consider it the equivilant of a kevlar vest with plate reinforcements - it's easier to contain the plates inside the vest than to attach them to the outside. And it's easier to have the armor attached in a way where it's more flexible and moves better with the body, without needing to come up with super detailed and fancy fastenings of some sort (which are ultimately much harder to create and maintain, and are more fragile in long term use). This reduces expense and lets you put more people in reasonably good armor.<br/><br/>And also - putting the leather on the outside insulates better than the other way around. Having metal as the outer layer does more to increase heat exchange and make you colder on a cold night. Very useful when you're a guard or some other sort of combat job other than a field combat warrior.<br/><br/>Also, metal on the outside is noisier. It clanks around. It bangs against walls and cobblestones. It gives away your position in a forest skirmish/ambush. Whenever you're doing anything other than a pitched organized field battle, not having clanky plates of armor all over you is a good thing.<br/><br/>Also, if the plates are on the inside, the whole suit can be held together by a couple of straps under the armpits that are easy to attach quickly. Once you have stuff on the outside, you start needing fasteners that are more complicated and slower to put on. Donning armor quickly is a real concern. Full plate takes frickin FOREVER to put on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368131/#Comment_368131" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T12:36:54+00:00" title="March 16, 2012 12:36PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 12:37PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>As D&amp;D already presents us with an "implausible" scenario where chainmail co-exists with plate armor</blockquote>\nSort of implausible. The romans are known for using lorica hamata (chain) and lorica segmentata (segmented plate). And there are both leather and plate cuirass armors (the posthumously named lorica musculata) in there as well - I think they were worn by officers, if I remember my reading correctly. Surely there would have been overlap periods where both chain and plate were in use, yes?<br/><br/>And remember that fantasy games are usually not about a squad of military folks from a unit that's outfitted in a uniform way. They're about mercenaries, irregulars, special forces teams.<br/><br/>To compare them to the modern military, fantasy parties are more like GI Joe. Look at the intentional differences in uniform, weapons, armor, etc in the GI Joe squad. Much of it is based on actual military loadouts (though the vehicles and weapons are often exaggerated and inexplicably laser-based). But they purposely mix and match in a way that is unrealistic but fun.<br/><br/>When I was looking for a loosely historical based setting for my campaign, I set it around the 400s - during the fall of the Roman Empire. It makes an excellent setting. Leather, chain, and plate armor all exist and are all in use (if you just replace late medieval plate with lorica segmentata) - just assume that people wearing less than the latest tech are wearing relics handed down through generations, and that barbaric types are using lots of leather and such. Civilization is rapidly falling apart into a "points of light" style, where it makes sense that a large military response cannot be counted on to root out incursions of barbarians. Bizzare weapon loadouts can be justified as belonging to ex gladiators and such. It's an excellent fit with a minimum of cognitive dissonance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368365/#Comment_368365" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T15:13:03+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  3:13PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">@RobMcDiarmid</a>: right, sorry. I forgot to point out that I usually read "plate armor" as meaning <i>that particular kind of armor which became very popular in Europe in the 1400s and 1500s, completely replacing chainmail after a short transition period during the 1300s</i> (while other kinds of armor, like the aforementioned brigandine, stayed in use because they were cheaper to manufacture): rigid armor which deflected blows because of its shape, instead of absorbing them, and (contrary to pop-culture myth) was also effective against the early firearms of the time (armor parts were routinely tested against close range fire to demonstrate they were "ball-proof"). I usually assume that for an entirely pop-culture reason: because the armor of "medieval knights" in romantic illustration and, later, in movies was for a long time anachronistically based on that type. If we're talking different time-frames, like your late Roman/Dark Ages scenario, then I frankly admit I have no idea of the relative effectiveness of the different kinds of armor in use at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16059/d-d-how-bad-would-it-be-if-wizards-wore-plate" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16059/d-d-how-bad-would-it-be-if-wizards-wore-plate" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16059/d-d-how-bad-would-it-be-if-wizards-wore-plate/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16059%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16059%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
