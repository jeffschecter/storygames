I need to remedy that! I might even have to GM it, because I don't know anyone else who's volunteering to. But I have a noob question.<br/><br/>Looking at the system ("Rolling the Dice") I'm a bit confused; the difficulty levels seem to be a lot harder than their naming implies. <br/><br/>For example, an "easy" challenge requires 2 hits; to have even a 50% chance of passing, you'll need to roll 3 dice. If you have a relevant trait and tag you can roll those without spending any of your pool dice; but then, if you have those the GM shouldn't be asking you to roll in the first place ("By default, characters can accomplish anything covered by their traits".) So we assume that if you're rolling you <i>don't</i> have a relevant trait, right? That means you have to spend 2 of your 7 pool dice to have even a halfway good chance of passing an "easy" challenge. Or to put it another way, you can afford to try about 3 easy challenges per scene, of which you'll fail about half, i.e. you'll succeed at one or two.<br/><br/>That doesn't seem "easy" to me. :-/ And as for a "hard" challenge, you'll need 3 hits, which means 5 dice to get a 50% chance \u2026 that's spending more than half your pool right there, on one attempt that will fail half the time.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to poke holes in the game! Obviously I'm just missing something, because Lady Blackbird is widely attested to be an excellent game with simple but enjoyable mechanics. So how does it really work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442012/#Comment_442012" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T01:51:17+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  1:51AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're taking that "can accomplish anything covered by their traits" statement out of context.

Who's gonna do something? Well, Naomi has the Key of the Guardian, so of course she steps up. She's going stand guard between the guards and the Lady, so Natasha can (presumably) get away. (Of course, the Lady may end up doing some else altogether, but Naomi's a stubborn defender and thinks she knows what's best for Natasha...)\n<blockquote><b>Bodyguard</b><br/>Awareness, Threats, Defend, Disarm, Restrain, Carry, Delay,<br/>[Security], [First Aid]</blockquote>\nShe gets one die to begin with (1). Then she takes an additional die for being a Bodyguard (2). Awareness, Threats, Defend, Delay definitely apply as well, for four more (6). It wouldn't be that hard for a creative player to come up with an action which also includes Disarming or Restraining. So that's 6-8 dice.<br/><br/>Then she can add dice from her Pool, if she wants, and possibly a companion is helping her.<br/><br/>If she was acting counter to her role, of course (like trying to impress Natasha by competing in a fine arts contest? Not as likely an action for this character...) she might only get 1-5 dice to roll. But then she'll probably pitch in a few from her Pool, plus possibly helping dice.<br/><br/>In the worst-case scenario, she just gets the 1 die, and then she might chip in 3-8 dice from her Pool, for a total of 4-9. <br/><br/>The hypothetical single-die roll *could* happen (a character doing something really out of character and right after blowing all their Pool dice, and without any possibility of help)... but I've never seen it.<br/><br/>[Edited to add: Cyrus Vance?!?

Once you drop down to two, things can get a little awkward even with a Lady Blackbird NPC, simply because the relationship 'mesh' becomes too wide.  A little bit of this is what characters people choose though, also.  Going with Naomi/Snargle/Kale makes for a lot of work for the GM because Lady Blackbird and Cyrus kindof NEED to be present to tie things together a little bit.  There are dodges, but it's tricky.<br/><br/>Ideally, you want LB/Cyrus, and then probably Naomi, and then either of the others is fine.<br/><br/>Er, anyway, what I'm saying is that if you can get 3-4 players, don't sweat the fifth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press" title="kelmscott_press"><img alt="kelmscott_press" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press">kelmscott_press</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442118/#Comment_442118" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T14:04:52+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  2:04PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I second everything Airk said. I've run it with 3, 4, and 5 players, and they all worked fine with appropriate selection of characters. If anything, 5 is the most tricky, because Lady Blackbird doesn't have strong mechanisms for sharing out spotlight time, so as the number of players increases, the GM has to work harder to make sure everyone gets to do stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
