I've been surprised about how this evolution actually began like 30 or more years ago. I've seen a lot of mechanics designed by unsatisfied players and concerned GMs to make playing more interesting. I've seen also a lot of mechanics to make the GM work easier, start the game with no prep or make whole prep with the players in one session or less.<br/><br/>So I'd say yes, now RPGs are more fun to play and easier to GM. But what could make them more fun to GM? As a GM, where's your fun? What would possibly improve it?<br/><br/>Please, let's just start with answers for now; I'll clarify where I'm going with these questions in a few posts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365028/#Comment_365028" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T09:06:38+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  9:06AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prep is fun.

There's some kind of transitional point where an NPC goes from "Petty Noble with Green Houppelande" to "Lord Veldik of the Rampant Marches," acquiring a scratchy voice and a tendency to glance away from whoever's talking to him - when it happens, man.  It's just the best feeling.  Improving GMing for me could be quantifying what happens to make an NPC gel and generating a toolkit or process to support that.<br/><br/>~Gary                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365035/#Comment_365035" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T09:47:50+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  9:47AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, playing NPCs rocks.

Staring at a tangled r-map, having to come up with that first scene while everyone's waiting, is a fun brainsprint.<br/><br/>When it works, when the first scene reveals itself to me and I start blurting out the ideas and then I get momentum and my delivery starts to get smoother, and then the other players start to react and then the game lurches to life -- that's the purest satisfaction for me.

Actually, since I'm a comic artist, I `m probably in the same ground with Sam. Perhaps it's just that I'm kinda burned up and I need a rest from it. But seing how games like 3:16, Burning Wheel, DitV and Fiasco deal with it, I found out that group prepping could be really fun, take probably up to an hour or even minutes and made me feel like I didn't had to worry about prep and just enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Gary, Guy - well, I had a hell of a time out of some NPCs, but mostly only when I was enough inspired. I feel like I had a lot of wasted material there, like I could have exploited some NPCs more and get more fun out of them. Does this happen often? I've also think as Gary, that I still have to find a better toolkit for me to manage character design and interpretation, but again I would love it could be something that gets implemented on the run. Pre-made characters are only fun for me if they are somewhat modular and there's a way you could get a lot different characters by combining a few different pre-made components.<br/><br/>Marshall - OH YES, keeping secrets beats everything for me. I usually made it so players have to keep secrets from each other as well. Actually, that's one of the reasons I still do prep, though I always have to struggle with my procastination. It's also a shame when secrets get wasted in a players move that erases possible plot development, but at least some secrets can be recycled. And there's also (good) railroading, if you really want to get there.<br/><br/>Nicodemus - making things move also rocks. Strangely in the last campaigns I've been GMing, I usually start moving things in a certain direction and then players come with another idea, so I end up leaving the wheel to them and just describing what they find. It's been an incredible fun experience and I'm grateful it happened.<br/><br/>Accounting for taste - yes, players are the ones that make it interesting, always messing with it and making it a real challenge. Now I know how supervillains feel about heroes and why they usually don't kill them in the spot when they have the chance (evil grin)<br/><br/>Thomas - let's say we're talking about an average fantasy heartbreaker hack with some indie mechanics, or just pick one of your less favorite choice of RPGs that you and your group would still like to play once in a while for a long campaign.<br/><br/>Matt - and yes, exactly what you said.<br/><br/>Orlando - I'm about to try something in that sense, I still don't know how it's gonna end though we all got the feeling it's gonna be interesting. I'm wondering how far from GMfull it could be, since having more brains thinking and adding stuff -with a good system that leaves arguments outside- must be glorious.<br/><br/>John - my respects man, coming up with a good idea for an scene in the spot, with cool lines and all is quite stressing to me. Whenever I can prep for this I prefer to do it ahead of time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, I was wondering about this because while I've seen a lot of games that make me want to play, pretty few make me want to GM. Among these are the ones that offer no need of prep at all, simple engaging mechanics and an interesting setting that players can build over and thrash a bit without ruining it. I've seen interesing designs, where just the possibilities implied in the mechanics are enough to give me the thrills of what could happen in the game. Other designs offer out of the box solutions for GMing in general, but fail to provide enough creative resources for players to handle the creative stress of coming up with something amazing right on the spot.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking if there could be a way to make GMing attractive to unexperienced players, instead of making them think it's something troublesome that one of the players have to do if everyone wants to have fun at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365090/#Comment_365090" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T14:00:20+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  2:00PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2012 2:00PM by Keith.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;I've been saying for awhile that I suspect this is the next unexplored frontier in RPG design.

I have to say, it was way more fun than just having one GM.  When I was a GM, I'd say whatever I thought of that was cool and stop talking.  Another GM would layer on to that and volley it back to me,  All the while the player's were reacting.  As a player, I actually ended up being the last PC alive and had 4 GMs at the table.  It was <i>amazing</i> to see how they collaborated to make things interesting for me as a player and character.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan't wait to check out How We Came To Live Here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365106/#Comment_365106" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T14:58:30+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  2:58PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I like being the center of attention, having the status/authority, and being able to participate more than my fair share.

For some reason things that I like tend to be not really popular, so I have no other choice but to run them myself (if I can find players and confidence to do it).<br/><br/>Also, I enjoy people enjoying content I created.
