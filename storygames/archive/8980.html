Something about unknowable radial creatures of neither good or evil brought that mad CoC flavor to any AD&amp;D game.<br/><br/>After 4e rolled through, I really got hung up on the <b><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/monsters/abomination.htm" rel="nofollow">ATROPAL</a></b>.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/EPIC_Gallery/Gallery5a/44165_C5_atropal.jpg"/><br/><br/>It's basically a floating dessicated corpse, like a super-evil sand lich. It floats around, and most of its attacks are basically "if you get close to it, its necrotic life-stealing field kills you. It shoots death lasers at you. If it's really bored, it may swipe at you with a claw".  Basically, it's a Necro War of The Worlds-like Lich King. Totally epic creature, I can see basically a party of heroes in an ancient underground lava-city* in the desert, taking potshots at it while hiding, running through old ruins, avoiding its death field and death lasers.<br/><br/>Vampires are cool. But an Atropal will show up in nightmares.<br/><br/>What's your favorite monster? It can be one you invented, but you have to tell us what it's like.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Thief: The Dark Project fans: Karath-Din, The Lost City.<br/><br/>EDIT: Curse you Mark Causey for making me think of the buddy-buddy friendly version, the "Atro-Pal!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198350/#Comment_198350" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T10:45:06+00:00" title="March 23, 2009 10:45AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2009 10:48AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That thing is fucked up.

Apparently, sometimes Mystra or Chauntea or whoever has too many shots and has a one-night stand with Cyric, and that jerk totally says that she's the only one, but then the next morning there's nothing in the bed but a damn sword or a piece of pie or something, and then her dad Ao finds out even though she tried so hard to hide it and he gets so angry. He starts shouting about her reputation and her divine portfolio and cosmic balance and how there's no way she can keep it, so one day she's missing and is "visiting her previous incarnations" but everyone knows she went through the portal to the Planescape multiverse. Then she comes back and Ao throws the remains into some far off part of Limbo where nobody will find it, along with all the others. But sometimes they wake up. <br/><br/>Seriously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198357/#Comment_198357" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T11:10:25+00:00" title="March 23, 2009 11:10AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2009 11:17AM by Daniel H..">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Also, the fetus aspect is artist Brom's take on the monster (an awesome take, at that).

Consider:<br/><br/>You're in a dark-ass dungeon; you can't see further than 20 feet with a torch before the dusty, moldering gloom soaks up the light. You and your party are bunched up, crotch-to-ass, and watching every crack and flagstone for a trap trigger or some kind of tentacle to come lashing out at you. All you can hear is your breath, the slight creaking and clanking of armor, and the dwarf's farts.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the lead torch goes out--*ssssizle*--huh? What happened? The folks in back surge forward to help, but the corridor has tightened, and the lead (ah, the poor rogue) is pushed into... something. Some firm, suffocating liquid that's filling the corridor. AND THEN THE GOO SURGES TOWARD THE REST OF YOU!<br/><br/>Gah. I mean, played right, the dungeon equivalent of a Roomba can be a fucking nightmare scenario. I always ran them as nearly invisible, though, not like Jello. Think the water tentacle from The Abyss, but acidic and prone to extreme stillness (i.e. hard to notice, in poor light).<br/>----<br/>Runner Up Favorite Monster<br/><br/>I was always partial to the simple things, like a swarm of rats. And along those lines are Blink Dogs (in the Vineyard--no, no, JK).<br/><br/>In the last LARP I played, they sent me and another guy out to be a single, rabid Blink Dog (as no way one alone would attack humans). Basically, either of us could "phase out" with an instantaneous arm-crossing (unlike the Phasing Ability, which took a Three-Count: three seconds) at which time the other immediately uncrossed his arms and could continue to attack and defend. Talk about freaking the SHIT out of a small group we decided to waylay. We damned-near took down four experienced (both real fighting and EXP build points) characters by just constantly flanking around, using the "present" one of us to spread them out (drawing attack) and then "blinking" to let the other guy (now behind someone) get in a shot or three while the first guy repositioned.<br/><br/>Even with them knowing where we were (though they were good enough players not to meta-game it TOO badly) they could barely defend themselves. That got me thinking... damn, a pack of, oh, ten of these (twenty paired NPC players) could wipe out this town (of maybe forty active PCs)! Easily, if they were smart and sneaky about it. And went for the Healer's Guild first. <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/><br/><br/>Running a pack of Blink Dogs against a party of PCs could make me want to run D&amp;D again after all these years, especially with 4E's big tactical element....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198393/#Comment_198393" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T13:15:13+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  1:15PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoblepas_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)" rel="nofollow">Catoblepas</a> has been a favorite for a while, but only because the name makes my daughter giggle.<br/><br/>I will commit heresy and suggest the owlbear's ugly, insectoid cousin: the Umber Hulk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198396/#Comment_198396" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T13:17:52+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  1:17PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inevitables - particularly the Kolyarut which enforces contracts and punishes deal-breakers.

Like: giving someone a fire mephit means you're displeased with their actions, an ice mephit means they're unwelcome to enter your home, salt is a declaration of open warfare (salt mephits are really unpleasant), and so on.<br/><br/>It's the Victorian language of flowers, except instead of flowers, you've got vicious, spiteful, and petty little elemental humanoids.<br/><br/>Plus all the awkward things mephits were made to do. An Ice Mephit to keep a storage room cold! A steam mephit to power complex mechanical engines! Etc, etc. There's a game entirely about Mephits, somewhere between Maid and My Life With Master in tone, somewhere in the imaginary library representing books I'll probably never actually write.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198410/#Comment_198410" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T13:42:47+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  1:42PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2009 1:45PM by ColinC.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got to be the <a href="http://www.enworld.org/cc/converted/outsider/drelb.htm" rel="nofollow">Drelb</a> from Monster Manual II.

You and your party are bunched up, crotch-to-ass, and watching every crack and flagstone for a trap trigger or some kind of tentacle to come lashing out at you. All you can hear is your breath, the slight creaking and clanking of armor, and the dwarf's farts.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the lead torch goes out--*ssssizle*--huh? What happened? The folks in back surge forward to help, but the corridor has tightened, and the lead (ah, the poor rogue) is pushed into... something. Some firm, suffocating liquid that's filling the corridor.

This is because of the stunning, awesome, cool, perfect, over-the-top supplement <a href="http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Freak_Legion:_A_Players_Guide_to_Fomori" rel="nofollow"><i>Freak Legion</i></a>, a miraculous, never-to-be topped splatbook made entirely of win wrapped in more win.<br/><br/>In the game, fomori are humans that have become possessed by Wyrm-spirits, i.e. nasty, corrupt ones, in case that wasn't clear.  They get powerful gifts but pay a terrible price, as you would expect from whiny emo White Wolf guys.  But wait: They don't live long enough to do much emo whining, and the "terrible price" isn't some metaphorical curse or anything like that.  Oh no.  It's a horrible supernatural disease that makes you spurt infectious black pus from every square inch of skin!  Or it's your limbs sloughing off every time you make a freaking roll and spilling out thousands of cockroach-like banelings!  It's being on fire, but not in a cool Human Torch way \u2014 think burn wards and Throbbing Gristle's "Hamburger Lady".  Oh, and that natural weapon that you can wield for six dice of aggravated damage?  It's in your pants, it's prehensile, it has teeth, and it's always hungry.<br/><br/>If you build fomori and (if you're a sadistic GM) BSDs using <i>Freak Legion</i> for your straightforward Werewolf game, you at least make some foes that have a shot against a pack of PCs.  But it's even more fun to just play "my monster is grosser than yours" and then throw them into a pitfight.  Great way to spend an hour or two.

Not only is that the simultaneous definition of monstrous terror and blissful salvation, it's also the definition of player character.  <br/><br/>Compared to a guy who gets to have sex with your wife on your wedding night and essentially owns  you, but who also stands between you and a violent and humiliating death at the hands of bandits, scary-looking mythical dead things sort of pale in comparison.

The Atropal takes the cake, but the Phane and Xixecal are pretty neat too.<br/><br/>Umber Hulks were neat, especially when paired with the Neogi from Spelljammer. Speaking of Spelljammer: the Giff, and the SJ version of Beholders. They're not just above associating with other types of Beholder, they're flat-out xenophobic as a species.<br/><br/>I have a soft place in my heart (and perhaps my brain) for the Nilbog as well.<br/><br/>Nightshades of all varieties from original D&amp;D. Biggest, baddest undead ever. Break your armor and drain three levels? Yes I will! I also think Liches can be done very well.<br/><br/>All the varieties of Genie, including the Tasked Genies from Al-Qadim.<br/><br/>Dark Sun's Cloud Rays and Thri-kreen.<br/><br/>Gem dragons.<br/><br/>Saurials.<br/><br/>I wasn't a fan of any one particular Baatezu or Tanar'ri, but the way they advanced to become more powerful demons was neat.<br/><br/>If Gelatinous Cubes were a naturally evolved creature, consider the sheer speed of evolution. They evolved to take advantage of 10x10 dungeon corridors. How long have those been around - a few thousand years? These things are the next step, man.<br/><br/>The Diaboli from original D&amp;D were really neat. They're a demonic-looking race from the Vortex Dimension that act quite normally and are nice guys when you get to know them. They just have a look that screams "evil" to us, as we do to them.<br/><br/>Another vote for the Displacer Beast / Blink Dog combo. Very cool.<br/><br/>Least favorite? Fucking Black Spiral Dancers, from Werewolf... specifically, when they show up in Vampire games, which happens in <i>every single Vampire game I've ever played.</i> Man I hate that.

It has a large, elephant-like face and a short trunk. The head is topped by large horns. Large fangs protrude from either side of the trunk. The chest is a mass of slimy, short tentacles. Long, muscular arms end in large, jagged pincers. Its feet are webbed and clawed. It is colored night-black but has red veins and eyes.</blockquote>\nIt had "See Invisible" and "Knock" as spell-like abilities, and if it got it's pincers on you it would hold you to it's chest and let the floppy acidic tentacles dissolve you.<br/><br/>In retrospect it would probably be more at home in horror than fantasy.

I saw it all the way back in 2E. It's all about the DM setting up the monsters correctly. I know that I can do Ravenloft (even the original Ravenloft adventure with some mods) "right" with 4e, keeping the creepiness and horror in there. And I've seen enough "this AD&amp;D game is all about HORROR, because you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your companions as always, but this time I throw Horror Monsters at you!" I had a totally uninspiring encounter at an RPGA event some time ago with one of those horrific Ravenloft Living Walls, basically the worst traits of a gelatinous cube, a flesh golem and a Clive Barker book... which sucked, because all we did was stand toe-to-toe with it and traded blows until it fell. Other times, we ran in horror from a neutral Ottyugh monster because the DM really played up the horror and suspense. That was all on the DM, not the Edition.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198539/#Comment_198539" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T10:38:36+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 10:38AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have always been partial to that thing in the psionic handbook.

The most common mounts were huge insects called kanks and one of the most common causes of death were people slapping their mounts and getting their heads bit off (perma death made it even scarier).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only monster I've used successfully to scare players was a shapechanging devil. Actually, the first thing that happened in the adventure was it lured one player down a narrow cave by mimicing a little boy. The player got killed and the devil took his place (he played the devil changed into himself from then on, the other players didn't know). Later the party reached their goal of finding the anchient underground city and exploring it, he managed to separate the other two players and kill one and then that player got to play as the devil for a while. The culmination was more smirkingly than anything else with the last player character finding the corpses of her party members while still in the company of the changechanger (they chose to show her the bodies for effect). The punch line was it killed her too but it didn't possess the magic to leave the desolate city so it was trapped there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmells like a follow up adventure!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NPC" title="NPC"><img alt="NPC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://nathanaelcole.com/_pics/me/spider.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NPC">NPC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198624/#Comment_198624" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T17:30:07+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  5:30PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2009 5:30PM by NPC.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://farscape.wikia.com/wiki/Budong" rel="nofollow">The Budong</a>, from Farscape (there's a D20 campaign setting for it, from AEG).

It's a horror standard -- but there's about a thousand-odd different varieties from myth and legend, supplemented by another thousand-odd varieties that fiction writers have made up, so no two have to be alike.  Add on that most of them can "pass" for human.  Then tack on that most of them can make people into vampires, and thereby control them.<br/><br/>A vampire can be anything from an easy-kill shambling corpse for your lowbies, up to a nigh-unstoppable engine of destruction.  It can be anything from a near-mindless snarling fiend, up to a witty and urbane opponent.  It can be anything from a lone opponent, up to a centuries-old mastermind with minions everywhere and resources you can barely imagine.<br/><br/>It's the all-purpose monster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198803/#Comment_198803" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T19:01:32+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  7:01PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good to see a bit of Kitsune lovin' out there.<br/><br/>...and yet another reason for me to be pointed in the direction of Burning Wheel...<br/><br/>(and yes, the Kitsune would probably think that the Joker was a marvelously funny individual, perhaps a long lost soul...his jokes really make you consider your place in the world.

I have had a cunning dragon in so many games I have run, entirely inspired by the dragon in Gardner's Grendel, can't really get enough of them.<br/><br/>But here's the thing, githyanki have an ancient pact with red dragons.  Rock!<br/><br/>In an old D&amp;D game I ran seven years or so ago, red dragons could, once in their lives, send a delegate and receive a legion of githyanki soldiers for their own use once in their lives for a year.  One of the players was kidnapped by a red and had to go to Tun'Arath and ask the liche-queen for several legions, as an elder red was asking for one on behalf of himself and his two children and his late son.

Most people are familiar with their role as an archetype for bullies, moderately tough, but pushovers when facing someone hitting back.<br/><br/>They're more interesting to me when they're examined in a colonial sense. We've all heard the term "orcish horde." The term horde comes from the Mongolian armies that conquered much of Eurasia. To apply that word to orcs suggests some things about them, that they are not reliant on city states, but tribal nomads, following strong, charismatic (at least for an orc) leaders, warlike and strategically mobile, attacking their targets more often than getting attacked.<br/><br/>What makes this even more interesting is that this is part of how they are declared different from the cultures the PCs come from, which are agricultural, have formal rules of determining leadership, and are shown as being "good" by being defenders, rather than starting wars. From their perspective the orcs are "savage" with all the implications that holds in the way that the Victorians reduced other cultures to the status of lesser people by declaring them "savages."<br/><br/>While this is enough to make them interesting for me, it also opens up the possibility of fleshing them out for greater depth by bringing in more elements from Mongolian and other nomadic cultures. Other avenues may be explored, too, as they are in the game Earthdawn.<br/><br/>So, in a way I like orcs because they help define the gameworld as a whole. I like them even more in Earthdawn, where they serve a similar purpose, but it is accomplished through a more intricate manner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199126/#Comment_199126" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T11:42:26+00:00" title="March 27, 2009 11:42AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BAH!

In a nice suburban town, I was walking through a park, and there were some small children, with their parents, dogs, etc, playing with <i>giant slugs</i>. How big? Oh, I dunno, maybe 5' long. They could curl up and the kids loved carrying them around. They were gentle and slow and great pets... except you had to watch out because they might fight with one another. Also, they liked champagne.<br/><br/>Now, that was weird enough, to have a dream like that. But when I woke up, I remembered that there was a Giant Slug in the Monstrous Manual (or whatever it was called).<br/><br/>And that brough it all back to me: what's the deal with all those weird "monsters" in those books? You know, the ones that aren't really monsters? The Giant Slug, from what I remember, could spit acid--which allowed me to design a clever trap involving a Giant Slug imprisoned behind salt-covered bars--but other than that... what are you supposed to do with it? Can it hurt you if you get close? <br/><br/>There were all those monsters that.... weren't really monsters. They existed to clean up after other monsters, or fill some other "ecological niche". But they didn't really <i>make sense</i>, you know? Not as monsters, anyway. Not as scary things that roar and attack people.<br/><br/>(Like, seriously... I think it had a "bite" attack. Can you imagine a slug the size of a bus trying to <i>bite</i> a human being? Does it poke you with its antennae first, to see where you are, then try to bite you blind? Uh, jump to the left about 5 feet...)<br/><br/>Who the hell came up with those weird things? And how were you supposed to use them? It seemed more like an exercise in creative thinking than any kind of "monster", as the word is normally used: "How can I come up with a situation where the PCs would need to fight a giant slug?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199217/#Comment_199217" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T15:50:17+00:00" title="March 28, 2009  3:50PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun fact: slugs have thousands upon thousands of teeth.<br/><br/>Fun Image: a Flail Snail.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://daggerstab.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/flail_snail.jpg"/><br/>Special ability: Warping magic.
