In all other games I know, conflict is numerical comparison.  Perhaps I compare the Attacker's Orange score (+ 3 if the player makes a silly face) to the Defender's Blue score (+ 1d6 if the Defender gives the Attacker a nickel.)  In Polaris, the conflict system is driven by key phrases like "but only if":<br/>\n<br/>\nA (hero player): I draw my sword and slay the woman's demonic assailant.<br/>\nB (demon player): BUT ONLY IF it turns out that the woman was the demon all along, so you killed the wrong guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, A can now choose whether to accept this price, or to decline the price.  If A declines, then neither statement happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this idea, perhaps because it feels closer to improv theatre which I've always wanted to emulate.  I've been thinking about whether there are any limits to this sort of thing.  Polaris has several properties that I'm not sure how to change, and I'm wondering if other games of this kind exist that differ from Polaris?<br/>\n<br/>\nProperty #1: Player inequality.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly two players, the hero and the demon ("Mistaken") can use the 8 key phrases.  ("but only if", "and furthermore", "you ask far too much", ...)  The other players have minor roles, and may not use any key phrases.  [edit]  The game is "fair", because the major roles rotate quickly throughout a gaming session -- but nevertheless, this means that Polaris cannot accommodate more than 4 players.  (Well, it can, but only if players take turns sitting out. :P)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the big problem for me, because my group has 5 players -- which is why we haven't tried the game yet.  Perhaps we should just try it anyway, but ... more generally, I think it would be interesting to see what kind of story players could tell together, if they all had equal powers in conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\nProperty #2: Character degeneration<br/>\n<br/>\nPolaris is a tragic horror setting, and it has characters advance along a "zeal / weariness" track, as they become more and more corrupt.  It seems to me that this track is used as a "stick", to prevent the character from using his/her abilities all the time.  (You can't refresh your abilities without also risking corruption.)  Could this kind of game take place in a less tragic setting?  If so, how would it control the use of abilities?<br/>\n<br/>\nProperty #3: Vague setting and characters<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setting is poorly defined in the rulebook, giving narrators freedom to invent whatever sorts of demons / relationships / societies they like.  Is this necessary, or could you run the game in a well-defined setting with well understood characters?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228232/#Comment_228232" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T14:28:12+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  2:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vonkorff</cite>I like this idea, perhaps because it feels closer to improv theatre which I've always wanted to emulate.

Since there's no one player with authority over the setting, everyone has equal ability to define the setting.  So either the setting needs to be sketchy and largely incomplete, so everyone can fill in those details, or you need everyone to have familiarity with a large amount of information.  The latter option works pretty well if you're using a pre-established setting, like Harry Potter or Star Wars, and all the players are already fans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228238/#Comment_228238" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T14:52:59+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  2:52PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Look at <em>Mist-Robed Gate</em> for some address of your issue 1.

I am from a different background than you, obviously and got stunned by your question. I would say that any subject and any story than can be successfully dealt with in a numbered game can be successfully dealt with in a number-less game. But the styles of play and (probably, people with deeper insight than me might have a different opinion) the internal drives for the players will be different. <br/><br/>I have always been a proponent of Jeep-style play and the scene they originally stem from, but recently I have come to understand how much these styles (specifically Jeep) presupposes. It seems like non-Nordics who try to play these games in most cases have to see them played live before they really get what it's about. Chances are that if you are used to different dice based games and try to play a random Jeep-game from the page you will be somewhat confused.<br/><br/>But: my experience with getting grown-up non-gamers into roleplaying tells me that both styles are about as easy/hard to teach. In most games there a lot of presupposed material. (The indie-tradition might actually be the best (least bad) around so far when it comes to this aspect, I have to confess.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228256/#Comment_228256" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T15:40:44+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  3:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vonkorff</cite>I guess I was pretty vague ... how about this: I'm specifically interested in whether games without numbers can exist without the three properties I described.

The Tragic Degeneration has more to do with the game's genre, and the other two have more to do with it being GMless.

Like, more of that than the entire tabletop RPG family that shares D&amp;D as a great-Grandfather.   Many, many of these freeform games are playing characters from popular fiction, as in people pretending to be Harry Potter and other Hogwarts students.<br/><br/>I also just wrote out a numberless rpg for playing games in the well-established Dark Sun D&amp;D setting, but I haven't gotten to playtest it yet.  <br/><br/><br/>This numberless roleplaying system thing has been on my mind for the last year or so.

One player is the Sun, and is responsible for moving the game/story closer to its conclusion. <br/><br/>In terms of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, character degeneration: characters have thus far been mainly static, but I am thinking about giving one of the groups the responsibility for indicating "transformations" of characters as a result of the action: e.g., the "dreamy youth" is now a "zealous prophet" or something like that. I imagine some characters will grow stronger and others will grow weaker if I implement this change.<br/><br/>In terms of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, vague setting: yes definitely, but this is finessed since the game uses a Ganakagok deck with quasi-Inuit ideas and motifs (e.g., one card is the Ancient of Tears (Polar Bear): to master or overcome) to inspire the contributions of players in the "plotting stage" of the game.<br/><br/>So it may be better to speak of "role differentiation" rather than "player inequality," as a feature of "numberless" games, is my conclusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228565/#Comment_228565" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T07:20:41+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  7:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some other examples of numberless rpgs with none of the described issues:  <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html" rel="nofollow">Lexicon</a> and <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/01/the_court_of_th.html" rel="nofollow">The Court of the Empress</a>.
