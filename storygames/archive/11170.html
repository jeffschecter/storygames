Not as in "OMG WE'RE FALLING APART", but more like "hey, we should talk about this stuff in a civilized manner and see what we can find out".<br/><br/>To me, it looks like we, as a community, agree on most things. We don't have very strong conflicting feelings about things like "is role-playing fun", because we all agree that role-playing is fun. Nor do we fight much about "can role-playing have artistic value", because we agree that sure, sometimes it can, if we want it to. We even all agree that System Matters.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to the role of system design vs. player skill, we've had a few recent clashes. Here are some viewpoints that I believe have been expressed - I'm pairing them up to show the potential for conflict:<br/><br/>- It doesn't matter what system you use; a good group will make it work, and a bad one will make it suck.<br/>- A good system will help almost any group have fun; a bad system will be sucky for any group.<br/><br/>- Systems that leave everything in the players' hands and force the group to fudge and make up stuff as they go along are just bad design! What's the point of having a system that does nothing except cower in a corner and hope nobody will use it?<br/>- Systems that don't trust the players' aesthetic skill and judgment are just bad design! What's the point of having a system that assumes players are idiots?<br/><br/>What I want to say here is that I think these viewpoints are equally valid. We, as a community, can contain them all. However, we need to recognize that - as in all such matters - there is no One True Way. Just as the Big Model helped us see (wow, I'm getting evangelical here) that role-playing has room for competitive play, AND immersionist play, AND all sorts of other play, and they're all valid - we need to recognize that there are also different philosophies of game design that are, in fact, equally valid.<br/><br/>What do you think? <br/><br/>And I do mean <i>think.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248226/#Comment_248226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T05:29:22+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  5:29AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2009 5:31AM by Graham.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I disagree, actually.

It depends on what we\u2019re talking about, It depends on context. Context matters.<br/><br/>To judge something, I need something to measure it against. <br/><br/>If LARPing, I want less rules because I can\u2019t carry around a rules book, want to minimize out of character play, and want things to move fast. <br/><br/>If I\u2019m trying to decide which competitive 1 on 1 tactical combat game to buy, I\u2019m going to buy the one that is balanced, thoroughly playtested, and requires as little rules interpretation as possible.<br/><br/>If I\u2019m playing a long term game with long term friends, I want something that is easy to customize for my specific group.<br/><br/>If I\u2019m playing an RPG with people who have never played RPGs, I don\u2019t want a game the relies on heavy player skill. <br/><br/>Everyone wants different things but products that try to be all things to all people tend to suck. But that\u2019s ok, we have an abundance of choices. And if we don\u2019t like something, we can change it or make our own. <br/><br/>Problems arise when identity politics and hidden agendas come into play.<br/><br/>If we start a thread, \u201cwhat games are easy to customize?\u201d and people start posting \u201cplay this game, I love it because it doesn\u2019t need customizing\u201d\u2026 no one is saying customizing is good or bad and no one is saying the person posting is wrong for loving games they don\u2019t have to customize. But pushing a game that doesn\u2019t need customizing in the context of a thread looking for games that are easy to customize isn\u2019t helpful. <br/><br/>It\u2019s also strange. Stuff that you don\u2019t like isn\u2019t a threat to the things you do like. Unless what you like is based on trends rather than personal taste. But maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe the concern is that if one holds tightly to a specific set of values and the larger group moves away from those values, then you run the risk of becoming a minority. So then people keep pushing and pushing their values, even when it isn\u2019t appropriate. <br/><br/>I like Story Games because there is a wide spectrum of people and tastes represented. I personally love it when there are separate threads espousing different values in different contexts. I don\u2019t like it as much when people push identity politics or hidden agendas in contexts where it isn\u2019t appropriate. Which only escalates when people push their own identity politics even harder at the perceived threat of others doing the same. <br/><br/>It\u2019s no fun to say, \u201cit depends\u201d but I think context is the answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248254/#Comment_248254" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T08:15:21+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  8:15AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games are different.<br/><br/>I might like Chess.<br/>You might like Sorry.<br/>I'm not going to go on your message board and lambast you for using a random element in your game.<br/>You're not going to go on my message board and argue that 16 pieces is simply too much to keep track of.<br/><br/>Yet role-players seem to be of the impression that role-playing is an identical experience across game systems and that the only difference is the setting material and some abstract, subjective notion of "quality".<br/><br/>So, yes, Matthijs, I agree - there is no One True Way, only a plethora of games. However, because of this ridiculous notion that there's this one activity called "role-playing", there's plenty of bad design that's occurred over the years and this does need to be addressed. Just, rather than saying "16 pieces is way too much" one might more effectively say "why do you have 16 pieces in Sorry just because Chess does? wouldn't 4 be a more appropriate number and lead to a snappier game?".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248272/#Comment_248272" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T09:20:35+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  9:20AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the Internet after all, and ever since the September that never ended, there is no opinion so ridiculous and untrue (like "most RPGs are based on bad design and most people who play them are miserable all the time but won't admit it and be rescued by us, our beautiful heroic designs grander than all the rest") that there isn't one million people who believe it. <br/><br/>I just say what's in my heart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248273/#Comment_248273" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T09:23:33+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  9:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikael, the way I understand it, you and I and many others are part of the problem, not the solution. Even if it might seem that way to us, something like "games are different and therefore you need to rationally investigate the different ways to make each of them work" is not necessarily any more inclusive an attitude than "rules are el stupido" or some such. After all, even saying that some games are different than others is contrary and invalidates the opposite opinion, which is that "all games are fundamentally the same". The way I read it, Matthijs wants less disagreement and more more inclusiveness even for ideas that you disagree with. This is necessarily an endeavour that requires you to make room for stupid ideas as well - and the fact that we think that those ideas are stupid seems to be the "problem" Matthijs addresses. We should be more illuminated and keep our peace even in face of stupid thinking.<br/><br/>Seriously, though: I think that a game that "trusts the players' aesthetic skill and judgment" would be interesting as a technical agenda. No idea if it'd be much different from what I'm doing now.

When there's a desire for social homogeneity--for a strong group identity, in other words--but low "ideational integration" (the possession of contradictory beliefs, in other words), the "situational logic" becomes one of correction: trying to resolve contradictory beliefs. Some contradictions are impossible to resolve, however.<br/><br/>The problem of how to get people with different beliefs to communicate productively actually gets a lot of attention in the scholarly literature. Political scientists who study "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy" rel="nofollow">deliberative democracy</a>" spring immediately to mind. The thrust of that work suggests that establishing a space within which procedures for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_rationality" rel="nofollow">communicative rationality</a> can foster public discourse and understanding. The question they are addressing has to do with how to preserve a pluralistic society.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=3612788" rel="nofollow">Leah Ceccarelli's book</a> on successful and unsuccessful interdisciplinary appeals in science concludes that sometimes strategic ambiguity is called for when you're talking to two different knowledge-producing communities but want them to find common ground: let us agree on what we can agree on, and table those issues that don't require an immediate resolution for another day.<br/><br/>I'm becoming increasingly convinced that communication style is an important first step. We should encourage communication techniques that open up conversations rather than close them down: charitable readings, "mirroring," non-defensive language, and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248276/#Comment_248276" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T09:39:30+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  9:39AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two sets of example statements seem to me very different things.<br/><br/>- It doesn't matter what system you use; a good group will make it work, and a bad one will make it suck.<br/>- A good system will help almost any group have fun; a bad system will be sucky for any group.<br/><br/>These just can't both be right.

What's the point of having a system that assumes players are idiots?<br/><br/>Both these statements are predicated on the assumption that one approach to system design holds good for everyone.  But if we know anything, we know that's not true.  It's entirely possible for you to prefer systems that allow for fiat and me to prefer more robust systems and for both of us to be right.  Here, neither statement is valid as worded (statements of how systems ought to be), but both can be valid as statements of preference.<br/><br/>All that said, if the point is that people listen a little more, and tell a little less, I'm right behind you.  I no longer discuss immersionism in any forum, having been told on too many occasions either that it doesn't exist or if it does it's evidence of psychological instability (I don't think I've heard that here though, to be fair).  The problem with terms, immersionism, Big Model, whatever, is they encourage fitting people within the terms rather than listening to what they say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248277/#Comment_248277" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T09:42:06+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  9:42AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Do you think a community relationship is different from any other relationship when it comes to the (potential) value of talking about things?<br/></blockquote>\nI'm not Graham, but in answer to that, actually yes.

We, after all, had it.  If a forum has a discussion, anyone not there when it was on the front page, anyone joining subsequently, knows nothing of it.  The system has no memory.<br/><br/>So yes, I think it is different.

But I believe what you say is true; it fits with my experience. <br/><br/>At our Norwegian role-playing forum, we've got a strong focus on how people discuss things. Irony and sarcasm, for instance, are seen as something that breaks down productive conversation. Varying forms of rhetoric that fall under the term "hersketeknikker" - techniques of controlling others - are also quickly spotted and commented on. We've only got the one forum, and it's supposed to be for everyone, which means we HAVE to be tolerant to people who have different values and gaming interests. We've had big fights over things like "indie gamer snobbery" and "how stupid is D&amp;D really", but we seem to manage to get through them.<br/><br/>Max (Balbinus), you're wrong when you claim the system has no memory. A forum has at least three important memory structures:<br/>- Its rules, developed over time by the members as a collective, which influences the way all members post<br/>- The memories of its active participants, which influence the way they post, and provides context and example for others<br/>- The memories of its administrator(s), which influence how they moderate others' posts<br/>S-G isn't heavily moderated, and there are few rules, which means that the main responsibility for keeping it civil, productive and open-minded lies with the active participants. Each of us is a major influence on the culture of this forum. We are its memory. If we decide to change the way we post, it will affect the forum as a whole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248454/#Comment_248454" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-24T11:09:40+00:00" title="December 24, 2009 11:09AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just came across <a href="http://www.intuitiongames.com/gray/" rel="nofollow">this</a>.<br/><br/>Interesting commentary in light of this thread topic.

Let's see what happens.<br/><br/>Heres's what I'm trying to get at: Two things that seem to be mutually exclusive can be true at the same time. Especially if these two things are stated in absolute, extreme terms - like the statements I set up in my initial post:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>- It doesn't matter what system you use; a good group will make it work, and a bad one will make it suck.<br/>- A good system will help almost any group have fun; a bad system will be sucky for any group.<br/><br/>- Systems that leave everything in the players' hands and force the group to fudge and make up stuff as they go along are just bad design! What's the point of having a system that does nothing except cower in a corner and hope nobody will use it?<br/>- Systems that don't trust the players' aesthetic skill and judgment are just bad design! What's the point of having a system that assumes players are idiots?</blockquote>\nLet me start with an example from the Real World of Science. There's been some debate over how we end up the way we do. Is it because of inherited traits? Or is it because of the environment? At times in this debate, people have been on the barricades promoting and defending these as two opposing views that can't be united.<br/><br/>The accepted truth at the moment, as I understand it, is that it's ALL inheritance. And it's ALL environment. How many arms do you have? Two, of course! Determined by inheritance! Except if you lose them both in a car crash. Then you have zero - determined by environment. The attempt to claim it's either/or only mucks up the entire debate - you have to have both factors, both thoughts, in your head at once if you want to describe reality.<br/><br/>My argument is that the statements I set up in the original post are false choices. By defending one of them at the cost of the other, we fail to see that the truth is somewhere in the middle. Here's one way of seeing how they fit together:<br/><br/>The first one: A bad group will spoil just about any game session. A bad system will spoil just about any game session. A good system can make a mediocre group improve their game; a good group can make a mediocre system shine. They're both a major, but not exclusive, influence on the game session.<br/>The second one: A system that has no room for the players, is of course pointless, as is designing a system that isn't meant to be used. A system should support the players in achieving their aesthetic goals - which means system and group agendas must match for an optimal experience.<br/><br/>I think what we're seeing right now is based on a lot of historical baggage, together with a clash of gaming cultures. For various historical reasons, we've made up our minds - in reaction to previous historical trends - that "dice are useless", or "freeform doesn't work", or "the GM is always a tyrant", or "using numbers ruins my immersion", or "system matters more than anything", or "the group matters more than anything". Principles like these stand in the way of learning and growing, both as a player and a game designer. <br/><br/>I believe that if you want to be really good at what you do, you need to actively search for that which you don't understand yet. It will make you more humble, more nuanced, and less sexy and famous. Fuck that. I want to understand what we're doing on as many levels as I can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248580/#Comment_248580" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T04:33:07+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  4:33AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's often true that opposing ideas both contain truth.<br/><br/>However, that doesn't mean <i>any</i> idea contains merit.

Almost by definition, a good group will have techniques of their own that will replace unworkable parts of a system (and by system, you mean the system presented by the game?), so that a bad system will in fact NOT spoil just about any game session. Of course, if you mean system as the totality of play behaviours, then yes, a bad system will ruin a session.

That argument generally has more to do with social positioning than with rational case or cause forwarding, and oft leads to bullying and us-them statements. <br/><br/>One could say many of these things, but then one would be wasting one's fucking time. <br/><br/>So instead I'll tell a joke: <br/><br/>I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties. Often, as a sign of their great respect, they don't even invite me. You too can win arguments. Simply follow these rules:<br/><br/>* Drink Liquor.<br/><br/>Suppose you're at a party and some hotshot intellectual is expounding on the economy of Peru, a subject you know nothing about. If you're drinking some health-fanatic drink like grapefruit juice, you'll hang back, afraid to display your ignorance, while the hotshot enthralls your date. But if you drink several large martinis, you'll discover you have STRONG VIEWS about the Peruvian economy. You'll be a WEALTH of information. You'll argue forcefully, offering searing insights and possibly upsetting furniture. People will be impressed. Some may leave the room.<br/><br/>* Make things up.<br/><br/>Suppose, in the Peruvian economy argument, you are trying to prove Peruvians are underpaid, a position you base solely on the fact that YOU are underpaid, and you're damned if you're going to let a bunch of Peruvians be better off. DON'T say: 'I think Peruvians are underpaid.' Say: 'The average Peruvian's salary in 1981 dollars adjusted for the revised tax base is $1,452.81 per annum, which is $836.07 before the mean gross poverty level.'<br/><br/>NOTE: Always make up exact figures.<br/><br/>If an opponent asks you where you got your information, make THAT up, too. Say: 'This information comes from Dr. Hovel T. Moon's study for the Buford Commission published May 9, 1982. Didn't you read it?' Say this in the same tone of voice you would use to say 'You left your soiled underwear in my bath<br/>house.'<br/><br/>* Use meaningless but weighty-sounding words and phrases.<br/><br/>Memorize this list:<br/><br/>Let me put it this way<br/>In terms of<br/>Vis-a-vis<br/>Per se<br/>As it were<br/>Qua<br/>So to speak<br/><br/>You should also memorize some Latin abbreviations such as 'Q.E.D.,' 'e.g.,' and 'i.e.' These are all short for 'I speak Latin, and you do not.'<br/><br/>Here's how to use these words and phrases. Suppose you want to say:<br/><br/>'Peruvians would like to order appetizers more often, but they don't have enough money.'<br/><br/>You never win arguments talking like that. But you WILL win if you say: 'Let me put it this way. In terms of appetizers vis-a-vis Peruvians qua Peruvians, they would like to order them more often, so to speak, but they do not have enough money per se, as it were.

That is, I agree that there's a huge difference between argument and debate.<br/><br/>What I find strange, thinking about it, is that in this community - which has spent so much time working on how to structure interactions between people - we haven't really spent all that much time finding out how to make forums work. There have been few real experiments in, and analyses of, different forms of forum rules/setups and their emergent effects. (The only one I really know of is the Knife Fight, which has had a lot of experimentation, but little real analysis afterwards). And we don't, as a community, seem predisposed to talking about it in a way that matters; we have some random meta-debates, often based on a random impulse from some ongoing conflict, and then we let it all disappear into the general hubbub again.<br/><br/>System matters. It's hard to overestimate how much systems of <i>conversation and debate</i> matter. <br/><br/>Imagine, for example, porting Graham's "Play Unsafe" to forum discussions. You could have rules like:<br/>* "Play unsafe" would become "Talk unsafe" - that is, expose yourself to others' ideas. Don't defend yourself! Don't stay with your own principles the whole time, it makes for horrible and dead conversation.<br/>* "Don't block" becomes... "don't block". If someone presents an idea, don't negate it - see where it goes if you build on it.<br/>* "Don't be original" might become "Don't be right". Don't try too hard to be correct! Let yourself and others make mistakes, and see where that leads you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248687/#Comment_248687" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-27T06:06:16+00:00" title="December 27, 2009  6:06AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand is having us on, as the British say: his "joke" involves using an unreliable narrator who thinks he "wins" every argument by employing utter <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html" rel="nofollow">bullshit</a> without regard for the truth or falsity of what he says, not realizing that the ultimate effect of his B.S. is to devalue the currency of reason.

we, really?<br/><br/>This indicates we don't:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>- It doesn't matter what system you use; a good group will make it work, and a bad one will make it suck.<br/>- A good system will help almost any group have fun; a bad system will be sucky for any group.<br/><br/>- Systems that leave everything in the players' hands and force the group to fudge and make up stuff as they go along are just bad design! What's the point of having a system that does nothing except cower in a corner and hope nobody will use it?<br/>- Systems that don't trust the players' aesthetic skill and judgment are just bad design! What's the point of having a system that assumes players are idiots?</blockquote>It matters what system you use; a good system will make it easy to produce great play, while a bad system will make great play a rarity.<br/><br/>However; there are some classical systems that are full of bad parts, but still have some marvelously good parts (the parts that made you love rpg's in the first place). Our discussions tend to miss these nuances, and thus we are wlaking into the grand disagreements.<br/><br/>So; we all believe that system matters, but we still discuss as if some of us have missed that point. They haven't; we continuously miss out on the nuances, that's all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>And the process of arguing helps us realise what's wrong and what has merit.</blockquote>I second that. That is the ideal, the rationale, the true premise for all discussions.<br/><br/>On the net, however, most of the time the process of arguing goes into the corner of intellectual fistfighting. I believe there is too much <i>arguing</i>, and too little <i>thinking and talking</i>.

I've pointed to the Knife Fight as a place that did some great stuff for a while, and experimented a lot with different rules of discussion.  I've given some examples of procedures that I think would make this a more constructive place to talk about games and gaming. The next step would be for me to set up a whole new forum to test those procedures, but... that's just more work than I'm willing to put in right now. (Does that mean I won't "put up"? If so, you don't know me).<br/><br/>Other than that, I have no idea how to answer your post. I'm not even sure if I should, because I don't really believe anything good is going to come out of it. Your post is full of this "straight talk", "I call bullshit" sort of rhetoric which I've never found useful. It just gets people defensive. What can I say? "You're wrong, I played with my friends just yesterday? You're wrong, this is real debate? You're wrong, it's helpful, illuminating, and clever?" I would just end up defending myself against random claims that aren't even based on an attempt to understand what I'm trying to say. It's like someone coming up to me and saying "your game sucks and you don't have a life!" Well, okay, if it makes you feel better to say that, I guess one of us is getting something out of this.<br/><br/>Just as in conversations about freeform or immersion, I get the feeling that some of the reactions that get posted in this thread - like yours - are based on some historical baggage. Like people are reacting not to what's written here, but to other things that have been written in the past. <br/><br/>If you think there's an interesting idea somewhere in these posts, why don't you grab that and build on it? Why not just say "this idea, here, I like - you should try that out, maybe like this"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248791/#Comment_248791" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T02:15:51+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  2:15AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aaah, fuck it.

I'm not just comparing the experience to other web forums either (which would be too easy to play: "Hey, compare us vs RPGNet/TheRPGSite/etc!"), I'm just saying in general, either I'm numb to it, or possibly I'm just being naive. I see people talking with passion about the way they do things, go "huh?" when someone else talks about their different experience, and then either let it drop or dig further with more conversation. Like Judd vs JDCorley on "Fudging as ignoring the dice after the roll" vs "Fudging is every manipulation of the system intending an outcome". I'm just not seeing heads roll. No one is doing anything that harsh, bannable, etc.<br/><br/>So there's two sides to the conversation, right? The communicator and the receiver. The communication that works best, IMO, is when both sides take responsibility for their message. The communicator relays their message in a way that they hope the receiver will take to, and the receiver suspends their preconceived ideas and give the communicator some leeway in order to receive the message.<br/>Some of the biggest communication fuckups here usually happen when one of the two sides take no responsibility for their actions:<br/>"Hey, I'm just saying what I say. I am in no way responsible for how you take my message, or how it makes you feel."<br/>"This speaker is talking about me! Their words are a barely hidden message that is directly intended to rile me and belittle my opinion."<br/><br/>When people chill the fuck out and act with empathy, communication happens. As Brand stated, a ton of "conversations"/"discussions" are little more than social posturing. Real game-changing magic can happen if you personally take responsibility for seeing past that bullshit and stop playing those shitty games. It's what I try to do myself, but of course I don't have the power or will to make others feel this and do the same. But every once in a blue moon I try to spell it out again so that a few more people try to "get it".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Conversations about how we should talk, or what's happening to Story Games, go round in circles. Nevertheless, they draw<i>everyone</i>to post, even against their better judgement. I think we should just carry on, talking about games, even if we do it imperfectly.</blockquote>\nWhile the above are pretty much spot on to my feelings on the matter (they tend to create a domino effect of people talking about their problems, and in the end there's really no suggestions for what to do otherwise, but make everyone feel kinda self-conscious and nervous), I don't begrudge anyone trying for a call for empathy and understanding here. In my personal correspondences, as well as the way I carry myself on these forums (and try to steer these forums when applicable, but honestly it's kinda beyond my own reach at this point), I point to Empathy and Mutual Understanding as the highest forms of communication on these forums. Far more so than Being Right, Relaying the Truth, and so on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I'm taking an extended break now, because this just isn't working for me.</blockquote>\nThis is always a good idea when you get burned out. I've often found that people who know they need a break or a breather, but refuse to take one (boredom? can't stay away?), end up finding blame in individuals, entire groups, or the entire forum for "pushing them away"; and letting their emotions drive them into a loop where they just get more and more <i>sour and poisoned</i>. A vacation hurts no one and helps everyone. Hell, I take off entire weeks here from time to time, and not just when I'm on a real-life vacation. Usually when my work-stress gets the better of me and I find myself pushing that stress here or on other forums: That's when I know it's time to back off for a bit, do something else, and come back later.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_248862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248862/#Comment_248862" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T10:23:35+00:00" title="December 28, 2009 10:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like what you write, Andy, and how you write it; level, calm and forthcoming.

That you do it by telling stories or engaging in abstract theorizing is actually adjunct to the deeper structural issues. <br/><br/>The Forge worked as it worked not so much because of how people interacted, but because of why. In the highest days of glory and terror, everyone was focused on making games using certain methods under a certain paradigm. The how of story-talking, grounded examples, and focused feedback came out of that -- it supported what the community (as an aggregate) was doing. That same methodology won't work on Storygames, because it does not support the primary reasons for people's interactions here. The system does not fit the creative agenda, and so even if it is applied, it will just give a different set of tools to engage in social point scoring. <br/><br/>Now I need a fucking joke here, but you've gone and made me be all serious and shit.
