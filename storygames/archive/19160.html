Then it crashed and all that was strewn and mingled across this vast new planet. Since then, the inhabitants have bred and generations have passed. People have rebuilt and old worlds and cultures combine, clash and evolve. Everyone (including the PCs) has weird mixed heritages. Nanites are used as currency and levels of self-augmentation are one thing they can be spent on.<br/><br/>Some features:<br/>- uses heritage moves to make bizarre PC races<br/>- dead magic world, but technology emulates magic<br/>- levelling up is not mandatory; instead of XP and coins, nanites are currency your characters can spend on stuff, including levels of self-augmentation<br/>- includes a list of chems and their effects<br/>- lore skill reskinned as 'culture' to emphasise that anything worth knowing on Arkfall has cultural significance to someone<br/>- includes a few starting scenarios, quests and jobs<br/>- includes an example move for PC flashbacks<br/><br/>If you read or play Arkfall or make something for it, I'd love to hear your feedback (also if you spot any typos, inconsistencies or things that are unclear).

There are world shards infusing the land, so there's an area the size of a pond, but it goes deep as an ocean and there's an ocean's variety in it too. Stuff like that, with the world shards allowing for things like a frozen city block just a few blocks down from a huge mudhive made by sentient bug people.<br/><br/>And would you believe, I didn't intend to make this game?<br/><br/>I had been struggling to find a one-shot that would interest my group, not be too hard to learn and be played in less than 3 hours. Then, I realised, World of Dungeons was perfect. And I could use it as a one-shot and/or extend it into a full campaign.<br/><br/>I also had a campaign starter in mind, which I'm pretty sure I originally read on <a href="http://jrients.blogspot.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Jeff's Gameblog</a> but couldn't find again. It inspired the First Generation Survivors scenario. Basically, waking up in tubes, one is open, wander out into a strange new land.<br/><br/>Then the Planarch Codex heritage moves meshed perfectly with that. And my players dug into the DW monster list with glee! Having monstrous/strange heritages is a really great hook and they're playing it up even with their characters having amnesia.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I cooked up this idea a few hours before my game session, adding all those inspirations together, using the Planarch Codex version of the World of Dungeons character sheet and we had a blast!<br/><br/>After the session I was keen to make the PDF and after I started I discovered your World of Mutants, which helped incredibly!<br/><br/>I hope people get some use out of Arkfall. I'll be using it with my home group, so I'll post any developments that surface.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427579/#Comment_427579" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T23:45:00+00:00" title="January 22, 2014 11:45PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!

So quick and easy to hack together a new special ability (or a loose group of them), than a new DW playbook.

Or flip through this book till you see something interesting". Then went on to explain further.

Here are some creatures I drafted up for my upcoming Arkfall session:<br/><br/><b>MECHSPEDITIONARY ROVER</b> | HP 8 | attack d6 | raise the alarm; forge relentlessly ahead; fearlessly protect the masters<br/><b>MECHSPEDITIONARY SCOUT</b> | HP 12 | attack d6+1 | detect impending danger; vanish into the surrounds; strike from concealment; call reinforcements<br/><b>MECHSPEDITIONARY HUNTER-SCHOLAR</b> | HP 16 | attack d6+2 | unleash a plasmusket barrage; spring a trap; route the target; use scholarly data to sudden advantage<br/><br/>The Mechspeditionary is a faction of intrepid robotic explorers. Originally built as simple scouting probes, later iterations included weapons, and soon, the robots emulated and outgrew their creators, but not their mission. Hunter-Scholar units, now sentient, lead the Mechspeditionary and approach all things in the light of their motto and programming: <i>"Inquire. Explore. Master."</i><br/><br/><b>FACELESS</b> | HP 16 | attack d6 | craft a face from the dead; craft a face from the world; use the powers of a face; retreat to change faces<br/><br/>There is a culture where identity and individuality are everything, and criminals who commit the worst possible crimes - defamation, masquerade and disfigurement - are given the highest punishment: they are rendered faceless. Faceless usually wander into the wastes and make a face of dust, becoming the dust itself. Some, however, retain enough control to envy the faces of others and seek to steal them. Faceless gain the powers of the dead or the environments from which they craft disturbing mask-like faces that imitate but do not capture the true essence of their source. Yet, the Faceless always need more faces...<br/><br/><b>GNOLL TRACKER</b> | HP 6 | attack d6 | doggedly track prey; strike at a moment of weakness<br/><b>GNOLL BLOODCLAW</b> | HP 8 | attack d6+2 | attack with blades and guns; launch into a primal fury with claw and fang; aid a packmate in the hunt; feed on a kill and grow strong<br/><b>GNOLL RELAY</b> | HP 10 | attack d6+1 | pass on an omega's influence; augment the pack with an omega's power<br/><b>GNOLL ALPHA</b>| HP 12 | attack d6+2 | make a show of dominance; send the pack to hunt; bark commands to spur on the pack<br/><br/>Gnolls are dangerous in a pack, deadly when running with an alpha, and terrifying with a relay in their midst. Gnoll relays have the fur shaved from their heads which bristle with sparking wires, connecting them directly to their dark masters, the distant and mysterious omegas. Alphas may lead the pack in the hunt, but omegas - through their relays - truly run things. Relays are just that, a relay for an omega's strange commands and stranger powers, able to share these with the pack. Gnoll packs following an omega's commands are unpredictable, but when augmented by a relay channelling an omega's powers they are unpredictable and a true terror to behold.<br/><br/>Here's some art I found that I'll be using for the gnolls: <a href="http://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/posts/list/555905.page" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/posts/list/555905.page</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427730/#Comment_427730" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-28T11:06:43+00:00" title="January 28, 2014 11:06AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like something I'd love to experiment with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mockingbard" title="Mockingbard"><img alt="Mockingbard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.pyresofvam.com/wp-content/themes/piano-black/img/fire32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mockingbard">Mockingbard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427871/#Comment_427871" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-01T18:49:20+00:00" title="February  1, 2014  6:49PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2014 6:54PM by Mockingbard.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This sounds like something I'd love to experiment with.</blockquote>\nAwesome <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'd love to see what you come up with.
