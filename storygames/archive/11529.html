The GM is supposed to use these statements -- like "I wonder what the deal is with the Train People" or maybe slightly more specific -- to place holes or questions in the setting for the players to help fill, so that it's not entirely the GM's personal project but a collaborative effort.<br/><br/>I mentioned that this reminded me a bit of the dice questions in 1001 Nights, where you place a die and raise a very concrete wonder, such as: "I wonder if the king will find his lost love."  These are, I think, supposed to indicate your interests and mark out possible future directions the narrative could proceed in.<br/><br/>Then, I was thinking about how these kinds of small voids might be used in GM-less/GM-ful games to mark out territory that the group wouldn't explore in pre-game planning but would reserve to be addressed in play, including larger questions such as "What dark purpose are these monsters intended for?" and more specific ones such as "I wonder who will try to steal the secret files."  You could also have character-specific questions, like: "I wonder who she really loves" that raise issues without answering them.<br/><br/>Honestly, I feel like these smaller voids serve somewhat similar purposes to the much-discussed "Fruitful Void" that provides a central question for the game to revolve around -- "What are the consequences of violence?" "I wonder what friendship is worth" -- but instead make the smaller details of a game interesting by making them complex and open ended.  Even if you have a scene where a character declares her love for someone, the "I wonder who she really loves" question may be smoldering in the background, ready to rear its ugly head in the future.<br/><br/>I think Vincent is smart to phrase these as "I wonder" statements, not questions, because that suggests there are multiple potential ways to answer the question and that you can keep trying to answer it even after someone has put forth an answer.  What you want to do ideally, I think, is demarcate areas of interest that you want to explore, not really puzzles that you want the answer to.  Answering the puzzle definitively may not be important at all, but addressing the issue definitely is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256913/#Comment_256913" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T23:53:27+00:00" title="February 16, 2010 11:53PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.<br/><br/>I can see this working in a sort of reverse-Mortal Coil setting development.

So if you don't have a Future like "I hope we sleep in a hotel tonight", then you can't start that conversation. If no one has that Future, then you sort of just <i>end up</i> sleeping in a hotel, or not, that evening.<br/><br/>Futures can come true. More likely, you'll think about them and explore them and dialogue about them... and ultimately you might come to a point where they no longer matter to you. If that happens to both of your Futures, then you become the protagonist.<br/><br/>Futures are the driving mechanic of Ribbon Drive.<br/>They're things that you start out being certain about, but over time you challenge and... wonder about.<br/><br/>It feels like we're in similar territory here.

Each Key is a major setting level question: "What happened in this science lab twenty years ago that caused the weird temporal phenomena?" or "Where is the true king of the land hiding?" or whatever.<br/><br/>Each Key rewards you for giving hints to its truth and for making the question relevant in play.

In the version I playtested a few months ago, each player started the game by identifying a local landmark, and then every other player would suggest how that landmark had changed after/during the apocalypse.  So you'd describe one place, then get three to five ideas on how that place had changed, and pick the one you liked the best to be the true one.<br/><br/>What if you had a game where that was the main method of exploring the setting?  Each player poses a mystery at character creation ("I wonder what the big explosion seen over the mountains last year was" or "why does no one recognize me any more".)  Then each scene of the game, the player who starts the scene is trying to provide an answer to one of the various mysteries the other players posed.  They frame scenes where character uncover clues that point towards one explanation.  Or they introduce mysterious NPC types who claim to know the truth, or whatever.  Once everyone has given an explanation for a given mystery, the player who originated that mystery can frame a scene that finally solves the initial mystery.  Then they can pose new ones, perhaps mysteries relating to the conflicting clues found when previously investigating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257005/#Comment_257005" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-17T13:36:05+00:00" title="February 17, 2010  1:36PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sign in Stranger is all about asking those questions and then answering them, isn't it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257024/#Comment_257024" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-17T14:53:26+00:00" title="February 17, 2010  2:53PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, Steve, Bret: Yes, definitely.<br/><br/>Nick, you're on the same wavelength with me here.

Basically, I'm trying to connect together different memes involving structuring play through setting up open ended questions or points of exploration.  You could possibly even argue that thinking about game design in this community has gradually shifted from strictly structuralist (fixed traits, countdown timers, strict scene framing) to a somewhat more interpretivist approach (regularly changing traits, ending things when they feel resolved, looser framing). It may mostly be a shift of degree at this point, though.<br/><br/>On the whole, I find these kinds of soft-but-substantial guidelines to be really powerful as a tool. They provide a sense of purpose and direction without feeling restrictive, which feels really right to me in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257025/#Comment_257025" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-17T15:06:24+00:00" title="February 17, 2010  3:06PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>Then, I was thinking about how these kinds of small voids might be used in GM-less/GM-ful games to mark out territory that the group wouldn't explore in pre-game planning but would reserve to be addressed in play, including larger questions such as "What dark purpose are these monsters intended for?" and more specific ones such as "I wonder who will try to steal the secret files."

It's not about going out after the answer (or multiple answers) and driving towards a resolution.<br/><br/>It's about honest-to-god, hands (fucking) off, wondering. As in, "Over here, in this part of the game, I will remain open and curious, not all planning-out-a-cool-thing because I am the cool GM." It's about recognizing a space for your authority <b>not</b> to extend into. <i>A place where you're not the one who is responsible.</i><br/><br/>So... nothing like Keys, or Bliss Stage hopes, or character-arc questions. It's a reminder not to be a tight-fisted dick who overplans every little thing when you GM. A reminder to let the chips fall where they may.<br/><br/>See how "I wonder what they'll do when they run out of food?" is the opposite of "Oh man... when they run out of food, they're gonna have to scavenge in the Rag Waste and <i>man</i> do I have some shit out there for them." Both of those techniques ("I wonder" and also "I figure") are good for the game. The "I figure" part is playing your fronts and their countdowns, generally. So wondering (and later, stakes for your fronts) balances out the other part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257047/#Comment_257047" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-17T19:55:36+00:00" title="February 17, 2010  7:55PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>Truth be told, I hadn't actually thought about it.
