What will the "mnemosite" actually be? What will it do to the group, and to individuals within the group? Could the game/ritual produce something harmful, or do our brains have failsafes to guard against such results? Groups have been known to do terrible things, when caught up in group-hysteria or group-psychosis.<br/><br/>So read about magical practice, and other ritualistic phenomenons, and see if there is some way of doing such a game/ritual, a way that promises to give you what you want from the game/ritual.<br/><br/>BTW:<br/>What would the participants act as;<br/>- themselves?<br/>- symbolic archetypes representing parts of themselves?<br/>- fictional characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_288677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288677/#Comment_288677" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T07:37:52+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  7:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>This is a real document?

That experience transcended the mundanity of everyday life, and rose to the level that we want to roleplay again so that we might achieve that kind of experience again. <br/><br/>I know this isn't exactly the "transcendence" referred to in the opening post, but it is a more practical goal, and it's something that's been done lots of times and could be done many times more, just by making a really good game.<br/><br/>That said, if what you're looking for is a more mystical experience, then I'd suggest designing a game about real mysticism. Religions have been working on mysticism for thousands of years, so that's a good place to start researching -- pick whichever religion seems least evil or most awesome to you (depending on your point of view), and try to look at it as inspiration for your game. Remember the principle of the <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=119" rel="nofollow">Fruitful Void</a>, so that you design the game around mysticism rather than on directly top of it -- putting in some sort of direct "transcendence" meter probably wouldn't work -- and then see what happens. It might be just what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288691/#Comment_288691" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T08:17:37+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  8:17AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Um, no?</blockquote>\nSorry, I'm not sure I get it then.

It's fun when it does. Not sure about enlightenment, but it does make you tingly.<br/><br/>In fact, I think there's a bit of "the zone" when it comes to cons as well: Before GenCon this year, I was idly checking on blogs and forums when I found the time: 10 minutes today, 20 minutes another day during the week, etc. I gamed about once a week, sometimes twice. After GenCon, it's been like 2-3 weeks now? And I'm playing like 3 times a week, checking forums and replying like 2 hours a day, etc.<br/><br/>I feel it wearing off a bit, but it's still tingly.

It's a basic tract, but very comprehensible - so much so that I can totally believe that it's looked upon suspiciously by hipster magicians. (I don't know really, not being a magician.) The book is clear about laying out the model of magic as a dramatic practice for reaching the transcendental state, and it has a bunch of rituals and symbolic systems to use for the same. And of course it's an immensely influential text in the field of alternative religion at this point, ranking as a modern classic of its genre, so reading it is not a bad idea anyway. A good choice for a beginner-level text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288724/#Comment_288724" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T09:35:58+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  9:35AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 9:45AM by Marshall Burns.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we're talking about the same thing, then I can say, yes, I have. <br/><br/>Strictly speaking, it can't be explained.

Learning mysticism is a bit like learning a language or learning to ride a bike, in the sense that it takes a lot of action and habitual practice to get a real sense of it, only the action is mental and spiritual rather than physical (though practical real-world behavior can and should play a part in it).<br/><br/>I would suggest starting with the Persian mystic poet Rumi, whose works are widely translated in the West now. He's one of those guys that people talk about a lot, and write cheesy guides to, but actually he does have a lot of valuable things to say. Another Persian mystic poet, named Hafez, is as good or better than Rumi, in my opinion, but his work isn't quite as easily available in the West. You could also try reading a translation of the Dao De Jing (also spelled Tao Te Ching), or investigating Zen Buddhist Koans. William Blake is a famous Western mystic, if you prefer something a bit closer to home. Personally, my favorite mystic work is called "The Seven Valleys," by Baha'u'llah, which is also written in the Persian poetic style, and like many of these other works, is available free online. For some context on important books from another culture, I think "The World's Religions" by Huston Smith is a good choice (not free though).<br/><br/>When you read any or all of these, take them little by little. Don't try to read them the same way you'd read a novel, for leisure, as they're not made for easy multicultural accessibility as such. Also, don't expect quick improvement in your mystic perception in ways you can easily notice. Instead, you'll probably get incremental enlightenment, which will be so slow that you won't even notice it until after studying for a while you'll realize there is something different about you but you can't put your finger on what it is or what caused it. You'll wonder if you would have gained enlightenment without reading the books, but as you continue reading and reflecting and talking about what you read with people, your insight will be clearer and clearer.<br/><br/>All mystic books tend to have contradictions and paradoxes and things, which is by design. They're trying to achieve a certain effect when read, referring to things which are by nature non-material, and not necessarily even "abstract" like psychology or philosophy would be. I would say that "understanding" <i>is</i> involved, but it's not the sort of understanding that you can explain; it's the sort of insight that lets you just know the truth when you see it. Like, imagine one guy who says, "I just lost my girlfriend -- what did I do wrong? I'm never going to fall in love again!" and another guy who says, "I just lost my girlfriend, and I'm better off without her; I miss her so much, but she's just not good for me." The difference between the first and the second is the ability to see inside oneself -- insight -- and gain enlightenment about one's actual practical reality just by looking at it, without need for philosophizing or whatever, and I think that's what mystic texts are trying to train, each in its own way.<br/><br/>Ideally, I think an RPG about mysticism would have some of these elements and goals as well, but represented as game mechanics rather than cryptic words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288728/#Comment_288728" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T09:46:04+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  9:46AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Oh, so like "being in the zone", like in sports or art, but with roleplaying?<br/></blockquote>\nIf I really get what you mean by "being in the zone", then... no.

Some approaches work better than others, and some people prefer one approach over another.<br/><br/>I think a roleplaying game about these issues would have to address contradictions. It would have to use imagery. It would have to switch back and forth between the abstract and the practical in ways that don't necessarily make sense at first. It would take time to really "get." It would not be easy, nor "popular."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288742/#Comment_288742" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T10:25:16+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 10:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so Marshall, what you're saying lines up pretty well with what Alan Moore sometimes says - all stories are real; it doesn't matter what god you worship (he uses a sock puppet).

So is it already here we just cant experience it? Do you have to fast, maybe take a substance found on a frogs back?<br/>\n<br/>\nForget the magic mumbo jumbo for a minute and I will try to explain a personal experience which i consider Mystical maybe enlightening.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end result of this story is the symbol 88, this symbol captures the process.<br/>\nOne of its meanings for me is "stop this is as far as you can go! you must experience beyond this point!" (experience the Mystical.)<br/>\nOk here goes this is deep but not as deep as one hand clapping.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Symbol 88 came from thoughts on the big questions like where does this all come from!<br/>\nMy investigations led to books like the Toa te ching <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching</a> Runic alphabet .<br/>\nThe runic alphabet was given to Odin after hanging upside down from a tree and seeing the symbols in the branches. So the story goes.<br/>\nThere's a bit of Yin Yang thrown in as well and looking at trees on the way to work.<br/>\nYou try reading this stuff and talking about it and reading those Zen head fuck one liners and eventually I think our thought process just steps back and a more  primitive symbolic mind process steps in and tries to sum it up.<br/>\nWell thats what I think all this Magic symbolism is. One mans mind trying to create a whole out of the ten thousand things which distract us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will go straight to the symbol. 88<br/>\nIt is the number eighty eight joined.<br/>\nI had been drawing the process of my understanding and this eventually came about.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Draw:<br/>\nStart with nothing as in no mark on paper.<br/>\nPut a dot. (   )<br/>\nDraw a small line (The one, Aphrodite )<br/>\nwhich breaks in two. (Yin Yang Separation)<br/>\nThese two lines arc round to join as in a love symbol.(Attraction)<br/>\nInstantly break these lines (The one is broken in this world but at moments can be felt)<br/>\nLet them arc round and join the original starting point.(Eternal love / Poss recreation?)<br/>\nThe Symbol of two harts entwined.<br/>\nThis image captures for me a lot of stuff about big questions and has spookily appeared a lot over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final linking of the symbol was a time stopping moment and I dont think you will feel the same intensity but if you could find a way to recreate that in a game it would be something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288877/#Comment_288877" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T17:27:11+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  5:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 5:47PM by Aik.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was this really crazy thread on The Forge a long, long time ago that described actual play with hypnosis.

Imagine for a moment a uniquely state-active way of communicating, and a state of consciousness uniquely sensitive to communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe term for this is mutual hypnosis. The experience ranges from something like a vivid fantasy all the way to an empathic/psychedelic trip complete with vivid multisensory imagery.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOver at The Mule Abides, I wrote some about <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/better-rpgs-through-hypnosis/" rel="nofollow">"better RPGs through hypnosis?"</a>.

The universe is a metaphor, thing.<br><br>It seems to make sense to me intellectually, but I have no idea what to do with it.</br></br></blockquote>\nYeah, I like Alan Moore a lot (although I'm pretty sure the sock-puppet snake god thing is an elaborate joke that got out of hand). Scott Adams says that the definition of "smart" is "thinks just like I do, only moreso," so, yeah, I think Alan Moore is "smart," generally.<br><br>As for what you do with it... You just, like, <i>do</i> it, man. Y'know? It's like walking. You just, like, <i>do</i> it.<br><br>The trick is breaking out of the day-to-day, rational frame of reference. It's a fundamental problem, and has been throughout the history of mankind, but people do it all the time. There's, y'know, dreaming. Also, are you a sports fan? You ever have one of those moments where the spirit of the crowd kinda becomes its own thing and displaces the personal for a bit? That's an example, too. It's an implementation that I'm not entirely comfortable with (I see it as particularly dangerous), but it's a thing. Then, of course, there's all the historical uses of hallucinogenics and psychotropics, but I'm not a fan of those methods either, as they can do serious injury.<br><br>And, of course, there's rituals. That's all they are (at least from one perspective; when it comes to magic, you change where you're standing, and <i>everything</i> changes -- you get whole new values for the set of "true things"). The trick is to give the ritual itself enough authority and resonance that it gets you caught up, despite the resistances of your rational pieces.<br><br>Erlend,<br>I'm a big fan of Castaneda's books (although not the man himself), but I want to point out that the stuff in them is mostly (say, 90%) diametrically opposed to ritual. So it might not be of use to you. But, then, it's 100% occupied with the issue of altering perception, so it might still be.<br><br>Also, it's almost certain that most of the events in the books never happened. But the philosophy is still useful.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288999/#Comment_288999" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T14:02:19+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  2:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2010 2:02PM by Tavis.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might be the idea Moore is riffing off of with the sock-puppet snake god thing: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://hootingyard.org/archives/4860" rel="nofollow">early experimenter in the psychology of religion Francis Galton</a> "\u201cwas strongly religious, but the only type of worship that appealed to him was the spontaneous variety he had seen among the Africans. He considered that their chants, dances and fetish worship expressed the genuine religious spirit of the natural man. As usual, he put that belief to practical test. Looking round for the least worshipful object he could find, he hit upon the comic figure of Mr Punch, and forced his mind into believing that it possessed divine powers. The experiment succeeded.
