That one last thing you get to do if your character has the unfortunate luck of passing away within the campaign. I think it suits the Star Wars feel more so than the sex moves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><blockquote>This makes me really, really want to die as an operative. Big time.</blockquote>\nhaha! That's great to hear.

I was running into the problem of player character death ending a game with an unsatisfactory conclusion. It's less of a death mechanic, and more of a death avoidance with consequences. <br/><br/>It's basically substituting death with a placeholder that meant putting off some sort of painful consequence or repercussion until later. So, your PC avoids death at that moment, and a possible abrupt but lame end to the story, but you will have to choose something painful later (loss of a loved NPC, maybe, for example).  I explained in more detail at my blog: <br/><br/><a href="http://solorpggamer.blogspot.com/2012/05/player-character-death-in-solo-game.html" rel="nofollow">Player Character death in a solo game</a><br/><br/>If someone has already been doing this in a game, I'd love to know, because I'd like to obtain a copy. <br/><br/>I did find out later, that Spirit of the Century does have a mechanic using Consequences as well, but to my understanding, it's not quite the same implementation:<br/><br/><a href="http://inky.org/rpg/oneshots/peril/sotc.html" rel="nofollow">inky.org/rpg/oneshots/peril/sotc.html</a>\n<blockquote>Stress and Consequences: Characters have a Health track and a Composure track, with a number of boxes depending on their Endurance and Resolve, respectively. When a character loses a physical/mental contest, they fill in the appropriate number of boxes. When all the boxes are filled in and the character needs to fill one more in, they're Taken Out: their opponent can narrate what happens to them. To avoid filling in boxes, you can instead take a consequence. Characters can generally have up to three consequences (per track): a mild, a moderate, and a severe. Taking a mild consequence reduces the damage from an attack by 2, and the consequence lasts a scene or two. Taking a moderate consequence reduces the damage from an attack by 4, and the consequence lasts a day or two. Taking a serious consequence reduces the damage from an attack by 6, and the consequence lasts until there's some serious downtime, probably until the end of the session. Note that consequences are aspects, so they can be compelled or invoked just like other aspects.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396997/#Comment_396997" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-10T07:03:31+00:00" title="November 10, 2012  7:03AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Honestly, folks, I think we may have stumbled on the new "killer app."</blockquote>\nAnd certainly in the years to come we will come to new appreciation of the "Killer DM".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397074/#Comment_397074" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T00:14:35+00:00" title="November 11, 2012 12:14AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>or really give any guidance on how to deal with it when the PCs lose a fight.

Like most players, I've been gaming for several years and have had my fair share of characters die in the midst of a campaign and it usually just happened without anything in the fiction being affected. I blame the style of game I used to play mostly, where you simply made a new character to join the adventure and moved on like nothing happened. <br/><br/>That, was super lame! When people die, the world around them changes forever. I don't care if they're a space orc or a halfling from the shire, we all feel it in dramatic ways. So even though I didn't come up with the Dying Moves for my star wars hack I was all too happy to implement them in unique ways per playbook. When The Operative dies, they get to tell someone alive a world-shattering secret that is there's to protect now. When The Noble dies they can put something into motion posthumously using their wealth, whether it's to hire an assassin to kill their killer, or the opposite and send for a body-guard to protect someone they cared about in life, these things change the world around them. Some of them are minor, like The Trooper who gets a warrior's funeral and chooses who inherits his weapons and armour, but the important thing is that the player gets to do something kick-ass that will, hopefully, leave a mark on their friends after they're gone. For me, it was all about legacy, something that the characters will look back on fondly in future sessions and it's my hope that those factors will play heavily in dramatic scenes between the players.<br/><br/>So that didn't really say a whole lot except how much I love the idea of Death Moves. I think it's brilliant and I hope more games start implementing them. I especially like them in AW-based games that use debilities because now when you're about to die you can choose between that debility which keeps you alive or a cool ass death scene. I think we'll be seeing a lot more of the latter in my SWW games. hehe                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vegedus" title="Vegedus"><img alt="Vegedus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/895/n84VMHBHNTJ6O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vegedus">Vegedus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397369/#Comment_397369" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T14:04:56+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  2:04PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd... Forgotten about this. Many years ago, when I first started making crappy homebrews one of my stated design goals was to have a mechanic for "that thing Boromir does as he dies", blaze of glory or whatever. Just weeks ago, I playtested a prototype of a homebrew and I didn't realize the death avoidance mechanic was problematic because it should have been blaze of glory mechanic! As some of the examples testify, this isn't exactly a new idea, but it's great with a thread to crystallize that it's a thing and should probably be in more games than it is.<br/><br/>My thinking in general is any game where death is an option and characters aren't utterly disposable, it should treat it seriously. Make some cool mechanics for it, or at the very least, some advice how to handle it. The default, 'just roll up a new character, wedge it into the ongoing story, continue as if nothing happened' approach suck. If the game encourages very high investment into their characters, it might appropriate to also give the player means to control <i>when</i> death occurs, but either way, death should always have impact, dammit!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397580/#Comment_397580" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T07:46:10+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  7:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Honestly, folks, I think we may have stumbled on the new "killer app."</blockquote>In GLASS, the Player Priority toggle enables the Commit rule:<br/>A player whose character is Unconscious [0 Health] may choose to Commit at any time during the required 300 Count [time to recover from Unconscious].<br/>The character\u2019s Health is immediately restored to full normal value, as is its Innate Armor.

The player comes up with a plausible reason for their survival, the other players (including the GM) rate it from 1 (terrible) to 5 (brilliant), and the player rolls 1d20 on a big table and cross-references it with the average score from the rest of the party.
