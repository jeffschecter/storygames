When these dice prevail, the GM gets a Coin of Debt.  When the GM spends it to hurt you, you get a Coin of Donation to use later in a tough spot.  <br/><br/><b>Charisma</b> These are the dice you use for being a basic, sensible politician. When they dominate, you handle the situation well and get the media to take you seriously. <br/><br/><b>Bullshit</b> Sometimes charisma isn't enough, and you have to go for the risky gesture or rhetorical flight of fancy.  If it goes well, the campaign gets a little stranger but it doesn't hurt your rep.  If Bullshit prevails, check off a Response (either Counterattack or Dodge the Question).  If you run out of Responses, one of your Charisma dice becomes a permanent Bullshit die to represent the public not believing you any more.  <br/><br/><b>Baggage</b> The other way to shift the odds in your favor is to call in a few favors from your backers -- your Church, crazed warmongers, 9/11 Truthers, sleazy businessmen.  These guys don't go away when you're done with them; they continue to hang around, lending their Baggage dice to you whether you want them or not.  When Baggage dice prevail, you "win ugly", reminding the public of all the things they don't like about you.  If your Baggage reaches 6, your campaign goes into a meltdown and you need to take a break from campaigning and fire your manager and press guy. <br/><br/>The game is structured by states, and each state should have its own theme: Iowa is cold and full of farmers and hunters, South Carolina is diverse and cooky and full of Evangelical types, Nevada... well, Nevada.  You know.  <br/><br/>I haven't figured out how to decide who wins a given primary, and how to handle debates (candidate vs. candidate, or candidate vs. Chris Matthews?)  <br/><br/>Suggestions and Actual Play experiences are welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121317/#Comment_121317" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T13:31:14+00:00" title="January 22, 2008  1:31PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I won't play it, but you got a big LOL and thumbs up from me! :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121320/#Comment_121320" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T13:39:48+00:00" title="January 22, 2008  1:39PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drats! <br/><br/>Reading the thread title I thought it was the game of being Fred Hicks, not sleeping because he has to write Dresden, run games at Cons, play Changeling with Rob and so on :-D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121325/#Comment_121325" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T13:56:54+00:00" title="January 22, 2008  1:56PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2008 2:02PM by DannyK.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's intentional.

You've basically got two Exhaustion-like pools going there, right?  It'd probably run pretty well, save for the ick factor of having to parse current politics well enough to stay in character. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121454/#Comment_121454" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T08:59:22+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  8:59AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2008 9:01AM by DannyK.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant for the Bullshit dice to be equivalent to Madness (you either lie and get away with it, or get called on it if it predominates), while the Baggage dice are the ones that never go away, like Exhaustion.  I need to write more clearly.<br/><br/>I'd love to run or play a game of it -- UFO Kucinich vs. Goldbug Paul vs. "I am NOT a robot!" Romney -- but this seems to be a minority taste -- gaming and politics are two oddly similar, obsessively detailed hobbies for me.  It also occurred to me that you could use it to play the guy behind the throne, working through his candidate -- this would be the movie <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Colors </span> if it were directed by David Lynch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
