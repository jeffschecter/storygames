I've been spending too much time reading roleplaying blogs and forums again! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt starts with one interesting article or thread, but as you follow links you bathe in a glorious wealth of promising articles, freebie pdfs, insightful threads and more. You gasp as you glance at the clock at the bottom of the screen and realise two hours have just zipped by in an instant as you chased a myriad of tempting leads, but most which turned out to be only marginally interesting. You've added half-a-dozen new bookmarks for places you want to check out again or which you didn't have time to read fully. You file away the pdfs into your tree-structured folders. You restrain your urge to reply to some of those threads (especially those which date years back). You quickly zip through your rss feeds which you've been ignoring for the last two weeks and end up reading for another twenty minutes adding a few more bookmarks and well-intentioned \u201cI'll get back to this\u201d reminders on your calendar.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen with trepidation you open your mailbox and stare at the flood of new unread messages. Mailing lists where you know there will be things of interest but you just don't have the time to read them. Google alerts full of irrelevant matches for your criteria. You archive them for a later date, but you know you'll never read them unless you upload yourself on an insanely fast computer and run out of things to read. Not likely with the countless books on your reading list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is only when you disentangle from the web-sphere that you actually manage to write anything, but you don't like the isolation. There are so many great ideas. So much to devour...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do you do it? Do you stick to a few established bloggers and your favourite forum (story-games?)? Do you have more time than me (about an hour or two a day for writing and reading)? Do you have some really clever strategies for keeping an eye on things and ferreting out the good bits (this is what really interests me)?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'll go and make myself some brainfood now and rest a bit to recover from the overload, but still I feel the urge of continuing my mad crusade to devour the Internet.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251421/#Comment_251421" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T13:14:14+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  1:14PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have any solutions.

All by just keeping abreast of a few information outlets on a casual basis (magazines like <i>Dragon, White Wolf, White Dwarf</i> and maybe an AP or two). I realize there were was lot undesirable about that situation, that it meant the definition and direction of the field was also limited by those handful of outlets. And beyond that, my wistful recollections are idealized; its not really that the field has grown so wide, its that the less-unified view over it doesn't give the comfort of one assured perspective.<br/><br/>Still, its sad that so much good stuff can slip beyond my notice. Even settling down into one kind of gaming can entail an overwhelming avalanche of information. Just pursuing an interest in the OSR scene, there's too many blogs (and now full magazines) to keep track of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251491/#Comment_251491" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T18:26:13+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  6:26PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2010 6:27PM by Andy.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For S-G, I only read the threads that have a subject line that interests me.

Look at that ratio hard.<br/><br/>(2) Try letting some of your feeds/forums/etc pile up for at least two days, and come back, but don't get caught up in reading right away. Instead, look at each source and decide: did you really miss any valuable pieces of information or stories in that time? Are there any posts that would really have made you much more happy or improved your game? Think hard, also, about the ratio of chaff-vs-(joy|utility). How many hours of chaff are worth 1 decent comment thread?<br/><br/>(3) Get real about your time. You don't need to catch it all. Your game will still be fine without it all. You only have your 16 hours in the day.<br/><br/>(Bret's advice is also great.)<br/><br/>I personally cycle in and out about how much time I spend on such.

It's nice just to hear that it's not just me! I knew there wasn't a magic bullet, but after two days in a row of burning out on link-mining I felt like sharing. I've actually noticed that it is far more fatiguing to read websites and blogs, following links and comments, than reading a book. I can read a book for hours without feeling tired, but just a couple of hours reading blogs and I'm spent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm actually usually quite good and I can spend weeks focusing on my writing. Sometimes all my spare time is spent on the sofa with a good book. Perhaps a roleplaying book or a good novel. However, the longer away I am from the forums, mailing lists and blogs the more I feel like I've missed out on something. Like E.T. Smith says, this makes me a bit sad. This is true not only for roleplaying, but also for my involvement in transhumanism and keen interest in technology and science (although for the latter I'm more of an observer than a participant and so I'm less bothered about missing out for a while).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike Bret I actually find discussions and ideas about games and their design fascinating, and I love discovering new insights and ideas which complement, confirm or challenge my own thinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nJudd, you are so right. These days most of my playing is online using VTs (like Fantasy Grounds) and at conventions. Both of these are pretty erratic and as my actual play has dropped my writing and web-activities have blossomed. I hope I'm avoiding madness by channelling my creative forces into my writing and by releasing some of my pent up roleplaying urges when I do have a chance to play. Still I sorely miss the year-on-year campaigns with 1-2 game sessions a week. Those were truly the glory days of roleplaying for me even if we made all the classic mistakes and knew nothing about the greater roleplaying community. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for a mobile reader it won't really help me as I usually walk to work and the longest I commute I have is about 7 minutes on a tram to the gym (having lived in London for 10 years I've become quite good at avoiding having to use public transport or driving). Having said that I am about to get myself a blackberry and might use that to listen to podcasts during spare moments.

Given there's too much to keep track of, there's no central organizing resource, and folks tend to stick to what they already know, different kinds of gaming (and their audiences) are drifting away from each other. Its a circumstantial statement, but I feel like there's less cross-over than their used to be. Even limited to just RPG's, there's a noticeable divide between different flavors of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Claus" title="Claus"><img alt="Claus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Claus">Claus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251697/#Comment_251697" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T01:17:44+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  1:17AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2010 1:19AM by Claus.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>The best days of gaming I have ever had are going on right now.

Always nice to hear when the golden era is now. I should be doing more gaming this year and in the meantime I'll be reading your blog... but I'll try not to obsess about it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
