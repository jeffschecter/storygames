Last year I was playing Traveller solo while traveling in Europe. And since I will be a Dad very soon, I figure my live gaming opportunities are going to be hard to find for a bit:)<br/><br/>Actually I had a lot of fun with old-school Traveller. I created four characters who were in a Free Trader, and had several systems worth of fun SF action. I used some solo Traveller add-on rules that someone on S-G had posted. I'm playing Starblazer Adventures because it seems to have a lot of the old-school Traveller flavor with the easy FATE rules and the fun Aspects.<br/><br/>And I am collecting links to random SF tables to generate content on the fly.<br/><br/>Anyone have links to content, tables, or even interesting discussions or posts about solo RPG play? I know 90% of it is for fantasy solo, but I figured there was some cool SF stuff as well.<br/><br/>==<br/><br/><br/>To start things off...one technique I found useful for getting "into character" in solo play was writing Ships Logs. In between systems, I took some time to get into each character's head separately and write the version of what had happened from their standpoint. Consider it <i>Rashoman solo play</i><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But it helped me to understand more about each character, and it always created more ideas to use for personal encounters and conflicts for the future.<br/><br/>Here are a few links I found:<br/><a href="http://www.chaoticshiny.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">Chaotic Shiny</a> has a nice collection of random generators. I especially like the <a href="http://www.chaoticshiny.com/spartgen.php" rel="nofollow">Futurist Spare Part Generator</a>!<br/><a href="http://nine.frenchboys.net/" rel="nofollow">Serendipity</a> has a lot of name/place/thingy generators, like the <a href="http://nine.frenchboys.net/plottwist.php" rel="nofollow">Plot Twist Generator</a>.<br/><a href="http://www.apolitical.info/webgame/tables" rel="nofollow">Age of Fable</a> is built for fantasy, but lots of these tables would be great for SF (or anything), such as the Dramatic Situations taken from George Polti.<br/>And of course, there's the <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Space_Opera_Oracle" rel="nofollow">Space Opera Oracle</a>.<br/><br/>What else am I missing?

Honestly, some of this is a creative writing exercise with me. And I am comfortable writing in the voices of the different characters while I am rolling dice and engaging with the game mechanics. <br/><br/>I rolled up a system (Noctocol) in Starblazer Adventures based on the last planet they were on when I was using Traveller. I had come up with the planetary aspects:<br/>-Government: Oligarchy<br/>-Parent Star Classification: Binary Star System<br/>-Not much of a starbase<br/><br/>And using a random aspect generator (for Diaspora) I also had the aspect<br/>-Methane Breathers<br/><br/>So I started out writing up a short Captain's Log for Starrider to get the lay of the land and describe the rudimentary starport and the strange economy built around collecting methane from volcanoes and shipping it offworld. Then I switched to the Pilot's Log as Zenith is a bit of a hacker and would want to get into the local computer system to find out what was really going on.<br/><br/>Zenith (the Pilot) made a solid Science roll so I had him write up how a corporate manager named Luther Solis was covering up the deaths of some Swarm Birds being abused in collecting methane from the many volcanos on the planet through feedings of synthfood mixed with increasing doses of narcotics. Both from his company Vega Augmented Engineering and from the local Sovereign Dynasty that ruled from the orbiting moon of Vulcan. I used various random sci-fi name generators for most of this content. Zenith also added the Tag "Shoddy Computer Security" to the scene.<br/><br/>I decided it would be fun to Compel Zenith's Aspect "There's Not a Computer Made I Can't Hack" to get him to really hack into the system in exchange for a Fate point. This time he used his Hand Computer for a +1 bonus along with the +2 bonus from grabbing the "Shoddy Computer Security". Adding that to a solid roll, and no only did he really get the goods on Solis, but he also saw the suspicions of the Sovereign Dynasty and their investigator Freeman Dunn. And Zenith was able to totally cover his tracks in the system.<br/><br/>Another solo technique I like to use is the conversation around the dinner table, ala Firefly. Like the Personal Logs, it gives me a chance to converse through the different characters, while developing their interactions and relationships. For example, Carl Rosenstar tends to say whatever is on his mind first. Leonard Zenith is very curious but a bit naive. Baron von Earthshine is always looking for the angle. And Captain Starrider tends to listen to what everyone has to say before making a decision. In this case, to send Rosenstar and Zenith to find out what the word is on the ground in the starbase while the Captain and the Baron take a trip up to the moon to chat with Freeman Dunn and see if he is open to trading something "interesting" for the proof they have in Zenith's Hand Computer.<br/><br/>It seems like a reasonable discussion for them to have. And by inserting themselves into a charged situation, I can already see lots of interesting ways this story might go the next time I am able to "play".<br/><br/>Does that explanation help at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_298952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298952/#Comment_298952" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T11:43:51+00:00" title="November  1, 2010 11:43AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2010 11:44AM by The_Magus.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought Mythic because of this thread and thanks for pointing it out to me.<br/><br/>Now every session can be like a Tarkovsky film.

Ex. a wandering monster table.<br/><br/>I was actually experimenting the other night with a solo game of Apocalypse World. I made some simple rules for Fronts/Threats, and I turned the Moves into a random table. When an MC would normally be prompted to make a move against me, I would roll on the table. It wasn't perfect and there is obviously a significant degree to which you have to play interpreter, but it takes the opposition out of your hands enough that it makes things unpredictable and interesting and prompts your creativity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshJordan" title="JoshJordan"><img alt="JoshJordan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6AKy_z4Epr0/TIfoTVksbnI/AAAAAAAAABg/OlTRzNj-YcA/s320/Icon.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshJordan">JoshJordan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299506/#Comment_299506" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T12:46:49+00:00" title="November  5, 2010 12:46PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently played through Jason Morningstar's <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/the_plant/the_plant_morningstar_complete.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Plant</a>&gt;, which is a modern solo game.
