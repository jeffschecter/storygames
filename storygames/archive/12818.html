They should go incubate over there. I've got a mortgage to pay. Being a retailer means I'll take calculated risks, not flog myself constantly after a product fails to perform.<br/></blockquote>\nMy thoughts: He's right.

Endgame is in downtown Oakland and while a very depressed part of the world, it is actually slightly on the rebound (thanks in part to smart retailers like Endgame) and it is in the heart of a megalopolis, equidistant between the wealthy and educated Berkeley and San Francisco.  Oakland itself has a massive hipster scene that is going to have a relatively high amount of gamer hipsters.<br/><br/>Concord, where Black Diamond Games is located, on the other hand, is an hour and a half outside of all that, almost too far out to be even considered the suburbs.  It has always been poor, but it has been particularly slammed by the recession and mortgage crisis.  There is a lot of speed addiction and welfare families out there.  <br/><br/>I exaggerate a bit too make a point, but the point is solid.  They have two very, very different communities to market to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288535/#Comment_288535" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T14:22:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  2:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it kind of funny that so much of what helped the indie scene to flourish in the past decade was thumbing its nose at distro and going direct. And now the idea that some indie games might not do well in retail might herald the death of indie? The simple truth is the same in 2010 as it was in 2001: Most indie game designers would be best served by doing direct sales only and handling their own fulfillment.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. As a consumer, it's really nice to have a consolidator that makes many of these games available in one place. And that's true no matter who owns IPR. But many producers don't do enough volume to justify outsourcing fulfillment. And even fewer print in such a way that their per unit price is low enough to make going through distro/retail profitable.<br/><br/>I think it's great that stores stock indie games, especially if they're a profitable line of business. But indie doesn't need retail or distro to keep chugging along. It just needs people with the vision and desire to produce their own games on their own terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288536/#Comment_288536" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T14:22:32+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  2:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points, walkerp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288537/#Comment_288537" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T14:23:19+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  2:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If he's got to compete with Endgame in a recession, nothing else is gonna pay his mortgage either.<br/><br/>More interesting is his impression of the role of FATE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288538/#Comment_288538" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T14:23:26+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  2:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2010 2:24PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to see more commentary like this from retailers.

I don't think he is saying indie games are dead, but rather indie games are dead for me as a retailer now that Fate has sort of spun off into no longer being indie.<br/><br/>So yeah, Thor makes a good point.

Somehow. <i>*tear*</i><br/><br/>As I've said recently, I love retailers from a reach-out-and-touch-someone kind of standpoint (not a sales standpoint, certainly). But I'm not going to be heartbroken if I'm some retailers don't give the privilege of cutting my profits to the bone just because they can get Dresden somewhere other than IPR. I <i>only</i> want to give the price break to retailers who think they can move the copies and don't view stocking my games as some kind of charity work on their end. If it's not mutually beneficial, I am completely okay with less retail sales.<br/><br/>That said, there are retailers who know how and love to sell indie games, and I am totally grateful that we've got them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288549/#Comment_288549" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T14:51:50+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  2:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Retail is soon to be dead everywhere, forever, for everything except perishable foodstuffs, and sweatshop-made clothes.

I was probably the guy in Norway who knew most about different weird RPGs. I could run them, I could stock them, I could talk about them. But people just didn't want them. We had Over the Edge and its supplements; we were displaying it prominently, talking about it to customers; I was running a fricking campaign every week at my house. Not one sale of that game for six months. <br/><br/>This is one reason why I'm not ever going to run a game store again, by the way. A game store is about the _store_, not about the games. If the customers want to buy Candyland and Twister, YOU SELL THOSE GAMES. And if they want to buy jewelry and novelty items instead, well, you start stocking those.

It just means that we have to get into retail the same old way we always have: by having games that a retailer's customers won't shut up about.

Nothing more. To this I completely agree that some of us are no longer "indie" and that's a good thing, in its way. VSCA is an independent publisher and, through our deal with Evil Hat, also a literary agent of sorts. Evil Hat is most certainly a small but not independent publisher. Categorizing games is an entirely different bit to yell about. You do not need to use my definition, but be aware that I do.<br/><br/>I've written about this elsewhere, but I've never felt that IPR was especially useful for an independent publisher as it encourages them to use the print-and-warehouse model of production. If you want to be small, you need to get closer to the edge than that, and really make technology do the work. Print-and-warehouse has economies of scale that make it awesome up there where you are not just some guy with a cool idea. Down here, not so much.<br/><br/>So, and I don't buy most of this guy's arguments anyway, if IPR dies I predict only positive things as we are forced to address the core risks in our production, marketing, and fulfillment streams. My fear is that we will just look for another IPR.<br/><br/>But I don't think IPR is going anywhere. They'll adapt just like anyone else.<br/><br/>Edit: thought I'd better add (because it's implied in the rest of my text there) that it seems likely that independence, defined as I do, will tend to imply "small". As any aspect of a business grows, you will need more help, and pretty soon you'll lose your independence.

Often, they need more support that most of us (are willing to?) give them in order to be able to achieve that. (In aggregate, retailers can also be a pretty efficient means of getting your product out to a lot of people all at once.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, you either need to look at how to strengthen that partnership, and how to act in a way that treats these people as people you're willing and even eager to share some success with, or you should seriously consider restricting yourself to operating solely as a "case 1" vendor (to use Vincent's cases above).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to Evil Hat's indieness, I feel I need to say that we have rarely made a claim to the indie label without others first applying it to us. I don't know that I, at least, have often felt truly a "part of" any sort of indie scene. For years, Chad Underkoffler and I have joked about our stuff being "too indie for the mainstream, too mainstream for indie", and I think that's continued to be the case. We aren't indie; we aren't trad; we aren't mainstream; we're Evil Hat. Period.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, the cyclical nature of this topic just upholds how truly ridiculous the "indie" label is, and how little control the indie community actually has over what the label means any more. The market has taken over ownership of the term, and that means the market decides what indie means anymore, at least in a commercial, "man on the street" sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not to say that Gary from Black Diamond got much of anything right in his post. He didn't.

Like you guys, retail sales are useful to me fundamentally as <em>publicity</em>. They're the most honest way to get people excited about the game. I could buy ads, make posters, make T shirts, but all those do is increase <em>visibility</em> \u2014\xa0and they <em>cost</em> me. They're there to increase the likelihood of people <em>playing</em> and <em>talking about</em> Shock: That's what it comes down to. If they don't play and talk about it, it's moot.</p>\n<p>That's why I'm kinda picky about the retailers I'll work with. They have to be worth my time, including the reduced time to reprint, that they represent. To my knowledge, there are eight retailers who carry Shock: Every time I see it on a shelf outside of those eight, it's an old, beat-up copy of an old edition that isn't going to sell anyone anything. But among those eight, there are excited players and shop owners who like to get folks excited.

This community has always been very kind to us, and I appreciate it. The relationship we have with many of you, while not something any of us could pay our mortgages off with, sure has a lot of other very non-monetary rewards.<br/><br/>I am not quite sure what to say about the blog post that has kinda caused a bit of a kerfuffle. I suppose the one thing I never really like is when anyone gets on a soapbox as an "authority." I gotta say, I don't see many authorities in our industry, pretty much anywhere...especially in the retailler community. I should also say, I am not fond of a lotta the "us/vs. them" that pours out in threads like this. (Warning, generalization in that last sentence. Not pointing fingers.) As we have proven, though the money isn't the greatest, we can successfully work with just about any size publisher, with or without an intermediary in the way  (be it Alliance, IPR, what have you.) It just takes a little extra time, a pay pal account, and some goodwill. <br/><br/>So, is Indie dead? For fuck's sake, no. Now, i could spend a ton of time giving you my definition of "indie" cause I think more than anything, none of us sharing a definition for that term causes more arguments than it should. Anywho, I think that blog post made some very interesting points FOR THAT STORE. See, that's the problem. Retailers often get lumped into one huge ball. Issue with that is virtually none of us run our small, private businesses in the same fashion (at all). In our case, we put a lot of time and effort into this community. We _want_ these types of games to succeed, so we have worked hard to make contacts in the community (both players, and publishers). I am finally at a point, after placing my first IPR order in 2006, where publishers look for us. Man, does that help, cause I can't always keep track of what's new, and what's hot. <br/><br/>Let's look at that a little further. Most good game stores have more individual SKUs than a Costco. Think about all the reaper miniatures just as one example. I stock about 500+ individual codes on that. GW another several hundred. WoTC dozens in the D&amp;D line alone. I am super lucky to be able to get most of these items through a distributor. I dunno how good of a job I could do if I had to seek each and every individual manufacturer out, and order directly from them. I know for a fact that many of my "C List" items that I have to go direct on, I only order at best once a year. Much of that has to do with minimums and freight (cash flow too), but to be really frank: it's cause I only remember to do it once a year. Yup, my bad. I am one guy, responsable for about $200 Grand in ordering for one small shop. I also work the counter every shift. Many don't. Many Do. So, that long build up is so i can say: Man, it's a lot of work to remember to order 6 or 8 titles directly for one publisher. I think to succeed in any category for a boutique hobby related business, you have to choose where you and can where you cannot put your focus. I like small press Role-Playing. Some of the neatest innovations in years have come out of this community. Hell, D&amp;D 4e wouldn't be the same game without the innovations right outta here. So we DO make the effort to pay pal, email, scramble, and scratch to keep as much of this communities' hotness on our shelves. So IN OUR ONE STORE, it sure as hell isn't dead.<br/><br/>So, to sum up. I think the tone and some serious lack of fact checking in that blog post raised my hackles a bit. "Indie isn't dead." Don't think it will be for a long time. That said, I suppose for a single store, it could be.<br/><br/>Chris H.<br/>EndGame                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288792/#Comment_288792" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T11:43:37+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 11:43AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris,<br/><br/>I don't get the sense that anyone is upset in this thread.

I know that I've only heard good things about EndGame, and if you've found a way to sell indie games - that's awesome. I'm happy that you stock and support indie games! But the support makes the difference. If you're a store that doesn't see indie games as a money-maker for your store. That's cool. Don't sell them. It's cool, we have The Intarwebs. On the other hand, we're also glad to see stores like EndGame as part of the mix.<br/><br/>(a more general comment)<br/>I think it's pretty funny that I expected the original blog post to be all controversial, and then after I read it I was like "yeah?

This makes total and complete sense, but I'm curious as to whether there's any factors that someone on your "C List" could make happen to help out both parties, outside of being part of a fulfillment service or distributor network?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Penn42" title="Penn42"><img alt="Penn42" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Penn42">Penn42</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288817/#Comment_288817" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T12:25:29+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 12:25PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 12:26PM by Penn42.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NDP -<br/><br/>I can only tell you what works for me, cause like I say, we all do it differn't. What is awesome for me, is an email, but that email is going to be different depending on where "you and I" are during the process. Let's break it down:<br/><br/>1) You are pretty sure we haven't ever chatted, and I don't stock your goods: Drop me a note introducing yourself, and your game. If possible link me to a sell sheet, or a good summary of what your game is about. Keep it brief, it at all possible. <br/><br/>2) You haven't heard from me in a while, even though we have done business in the past: Honestly, I love getting emails from people like this. I got one today as a matter of fact that I owe a response to. Again, keep it brief, and just ask me if I need anything.<br/><br/>Things I don't much like: I _hate it_ when people drop by without an appointment. "just cause I am sitting behind the counter doesn't mean I have time for a sales pitch." Sounds harsh? Kinda. Wizards did this a couple weeks back. Showed up with a couple guys to run down the whole essentials line for us. Didn't bother to call, set anything up, etc. Just rolled in. Problem: I wasn't there. I do all the ordering. I would have been NICE to have been there. If you make a face to face appointment, I _will_ make sure I have someone covering me so I can devote that time, to you.<br/><br/>Again, others want this done differently. Your milage will vary.<br/><br/>Ch                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288827/#Comment_288827" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T13:11:21+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  1:11PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 1:11PM by walkerp.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Penn42</cite> Wizards did this a couple weeks back.

Circa 2005-6 or so, it looked -- at least to me, and I was clearly wrong -- like IPR (including it's move towards selling to retailers) was going to eventually become THE go-to place for small press games, but it is increasingly clear that moment has passed quickly and people continue to do things like sell purely direct or sell only to local retailers they know and etc.  It's also clear that small press publishers are at least as diverse as retailers and, consequently, holding them all -- or even the best of them -- under the same roof is nearly impossible.  We don't have the same interests or desires or publishing goals.  Also, we all seem to be perpetually dissatisfied with available publishing / distribution options and continually looking for better ones.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I don't expect any of this to stop anytime soon.  And, honestly, that's probably a good thing.  If people are already fed up with these conversations, I'm not sure what to say, because they seem to come with the territory and be critical to the entire enterprise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288936/#Comment_288936" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T07:48:36+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  7:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Curse you day job!

My understanding is that many gamers don't spend a lot of time online reading about new games (or go to conventions) and mainly hear about new games through word of mouth, often at retail stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I've been hearing lately is that indie games require more help to sell on a retail level, and retailers that buy direct are more likely to give them that help, then maybe a retailer friendly distribution system will only marginally benefit indie publishers (unless it is bundled with materials and resources to help sell those games). But there are no hard numbers that I'm aware of to confirm or deny this. But I could be wrong.

I know the "recommendations" do fill that niche to a degree, but they aren't suitable for a "a dozen good indie titles to bring us to the minimum order value" which I _think_ retailers might value.

They might bundle the books for sale to customers, but more likely the bundle would just serve to help the retailer to identify key characteristics of games and to keep costs down for individual publishers.  Also, as indicated by the original post link, some games will help bring attention to others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Penn42" title="Penn42"><img alt="Penn42" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Penn42">Penn42</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289393/#Comment_289393" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T13:18:15+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  1:18PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2010 1:20PM by Penn42.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Destroy, confirm, challenge, or revise these assumptions...<br/><br/>- Many retailers only buy through distributors.<br/></blockquote>\n* Very True.\n<blockquote><br/>- A few buy direct.

My understanding is that many gamers don't spend a lot of time online reading about new games (or go to conventions) and mainly hear about new games through word of mouth, often at retail stores.<br/></blockquote>\n* As much as everyone wants to think gamers are all as Alpha as the folks who hit RPGnet, Story Games, Geekdo, etc, etc., they aren't. The folks who treat their hobby as a casual interest, and use information pushed to them as a way to hear about new things are still a pretty big percentage.\n<blockquote><br/>But what I've been hearing lately is that indie games require more help to sell on a retail level, and retailers that buy direct are more likely to give them that help, then maybe a retailer friendly distribution system will only marginally benefit indie publishers (unless it is bundled with materials and resources to help sell those games). But there are no hard numbers that I'm aware of to confirm or deny this. But I could be wrong. Either way, I think IPR would be very successful if it moved in that direction.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289612/#Comment_289612" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T12:44:06+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 12:44PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Amazed that this didn't pop up sooner.

I've seen a number of RPG centric stores go out of business. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>We stock over a thousand different board and card games (counting expansions) and they are a valuable part of oru retail business, but role playing games remain our strongest category. Thats not even counting that a healthy portion of our miniature sales are miniatures sold as accessories for RPG game usage.</blockquote>\nI'm happy to hear that it's working for you, but I've seen more often than not that it isn't enough to sustain a business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289843/#Comment_289843" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T10:07:26+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:07AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;I'm happy to hear that it's working for you, but I've seen more often than not that it isn't enough to sustain a business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289865/#Comment_289865" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T10:36:42+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: guildofblades</cite>A large majority of small businesses fail, in all industries.
