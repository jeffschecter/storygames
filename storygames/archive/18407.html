It's a smaller project (still a book), but some of you may be interested by what (and why) we've done with it, althought you don't speak french.<br/><br/><a href="http://fr.ulule.com/train-denfer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fr.ulule.com/train-denfer/</a><br/><br/><br/>It's not just about doing "pretty" things. Our goal is to extend the audience of those games (storygames, indy games) outside of their traditionnal borders, towards non-rpg gamers.  And sometimes re-interpret them with a proper cultural context.<br/><br/>HfL had potential for both. It's a somehow "gamist" game, fun to play and with an interesting background. So here is what've done :<br/><br/>In order to make the game more accessible to non gamers:<br/>- The rules were rewrited following A penny for my thoughts structure (a game we've published in french too). You should have to read it before playing<br/>- For the laziest, we've included an audio version of the rules in the book via QR-code, readed by a profesionnal actor.<br/><br/>In order to make the game more attractive in Conventions / public spaces :<br/>- We have included ion the book demos to teach the game, from 5 min to 45 min. <br/>- We provide an XXL board and a giant one (about 2 meters long)<br/><br/> All that wrapped in a 70's/ early 80's layout and feeling .\ufeffFor those who my be interested in that shift:<br/><br/>Das millionen Spiel <br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-jH5auUN8Rvs?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH5auUN8Rvs"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/jH5auUN8Rvs/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span> (made in 1970 / taking place in 200?)<br/><br/>Le prix du danger, bu Yves boisset<br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-QC0dAqp_dEI?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC0dAqp_dEI"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/QC0dAqp_dEI/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-UDA1z8lsGw8?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDA1z8lsGw8"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/UDA1z8lsGw8/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span> (made in 1983/ taking place in 2005).<br/><br/>Both based on a novel by R. Sheckley "The Prize of Peril"<br/><br/><br/>I really love this game, and i think Sebastian's work is under-considered. Part of the problem may be the original tagline and focus ("murder equal extra dice"), while there is a potential for much more, including remplacing "violence" by other kind of focus. Even there, "Violence" can take a lot of meanings, including "Toon" madness.<br/><br/>There's much more to tell about it, but i bet i've already tormented you enough with my english. Thanks for reading.<br/><br/>If you don't know about HfL, it's worth checking Sebastian website<br/><br/><a href="http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/games/hell-for-leather/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/games/hell-for-leather/</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414821/#Comment_414821" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T08:24:22+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  8:24AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa!

A kind of "path dependency" of all the production-distribution system (at least, here). <br/><br/>When you say "rpg", buyers (shops) are flying away. RPG market is far too small. Buyers don't matter about if it's very different, or if you don't need to read the rules before playing. It's a rpg, so it's not for him.<br/><br/>You can say "storygames" instead, but you will have to explain what is it and eventually, he will probably use one of the categories he already know: RPG or Boardgame.<br/><br/>It's a long and hard process to give live to a new "label", a new space between rpg ("D&amp;D, for nerds and teenagers") and (euro)boardgames, but it's an absolute necessity to expand the market (=give the wider audience they desserve to those games)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414893/#Comment_414893" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T05:04:18+00:00" title="May 29, 2013  5:04AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2013 7:35AM by Rickard.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's a long and hard process to give live to a new "label", a new space between rpg ("D&amp;D, for nerds and teenagers") and ...</blockquote>\nI wont call my next game <b>This Is Pulp</b> a roleplaying game. There are a lot of unnecessary expectations in that case that I have to fight. The roleplaying games nerds will not think it's a roleplaying game because it's not what they think roleplaying games should be like, non-gamers will think I'm trying to sell a computer game (or a LARP, if in Sweden) and retailers will find it hard to sell just by it's label.<br/><br/>There are a lot of time demanding issues with roleplaying games that may make it hard for non-gamers to embrace. You need to read a lot before even begin to play (hello <b>Apocalypse World</b>). You need to write an adventure (hello traditional games). Even the players need to create characters before they begin to play, which is a really weird thing because how can you create characters if you don't know what story that they will be in? It's also an unsaid rule that you need to play for at least 3-5 hours per session. Yes, I know. It's strawmen arguments but I'm generalizing. There are some games that solves most points in a nice way but they fail in others<br/><br/>To summarize: a roleplaying game suited for non-gamers (or more exactly, non-RPGers) should in my opinion have the following features.<ul><li>Learn-as-you-play rules.</li>\n<li>Exercise<b>s</b> to learn the participants to lower their guards, give structure for play and encourage collaboration.</li>\n<li>Improvised game play, based on exercises, with a clear goal (end game).</li>\n<li>No character creation. Either it's draw a pre-made character or the characters are intuitively created through creating relationships or by the theme of the game. OR ... the characters aren't needed. It can be you with a twist.</li>\n<li>Easy-to-understand settings. Either made by the participants (through an exercise) or by using tropes and other references.</li>\n<li>Structures (exercises, lists to follows, rules) that makes things happen. No more passive skills, like lock pick, where the players needs to wait for a lock to be able to use their skills (as a crude example).</li>\n<li>One hour sessions (\xb130 minutes). If you want to play longer, replay the game. The replay itself could pick up from the previous session so it feels like it's continuous, but it's not necessary.</li></ul>\nI was going to make a thread of my own about this. Perhaps I should have done that instead?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414897/#Comment_414897" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T06:00:22+00:00" title="May 29, 2013  6:00AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before anything, i Just want to make clear that RPG=nerds is not that <i>I</i> think, but for sure that most of non gamers think.<br/><br/>Anyway, i agree perfectly in almost all that you say and it's that we try to do. And it's really a hard and time consuming work (much more than just translating). On the other side, as i said, even if your game may be like that, it do not ensure that it will touch the potential target.<br/><br/>I mean : we have to create a whole new space. Else, your game maybe as (or even more) easy to practice than a boardgame, but it will still be classified in the existing fields by magazines, distributors, shops and eventually, gamers.<br/><br/>Until now, here is that I saw that with our boxed version of DW :<br/><br/>-  Some RPG gamers just don't understand / have no idea of something non traditionnal/simulationist. They see it as "simplified" (too "simple" for them - just for non-gamers). No to talk about a box.<br/><br/>- Many RPG gamers like it, but they make comparisions with Pathfinder initiation box. They see the game as "very nice", but not as "practical" before anything. Because as hardcore gamers, they are used to "build" their game, or play with post-it and a pieces of paper. Plus, they prefer to keep to themselves.They don't want to (or just think about) open their table to <del>strangers </del>non-RPG-gamers. <br/><br/>- Some of RPG gamers i've meet told me they didn't pledge because they thought it was a boardgame...<br/><br/>etc... <br/><br/>Not to talk about VAT problems (here, there's a much mower tax on book.

I'm not saying that my game is extremely unique. It IS a roleplaying game, just as yours are, but I don't want to be in the same market as other roleplaying games.\n<blockquote>- Some of RPG gamers i've meet told me they didn't pledge because they thought it was a boardgame...</blockquote>\nI would actually prefer if my game was treated as a boardgame, just like Gloom and Once Upon a Time is treated like card games (They aren't card games in my book. They are IMHO roleplaying games). I don't want hardcore roleplaying gamers to play my game. I want people interested in leisure games to play my game. People who picks up my game when they and their friends want to be amused for an hour. If they think it's a boardgame, then it's a good thing.

I love that Sebastian's game is getting a wider audience. (Disclaimer, I guess: I beta-tested very early versions of the game and I wrote the third expansion, The Martyrdom of Gaius Flavius, so I may be biased here. Also I have the "MURDER EQUALS EXTRA DICE" t-shirt, so I kinda like that slogan ;P)<br/><br/>Sebastian was thinking about a ninja version of the game for a while where violence would be replaced by noise. I can imagine a post-singularity hard sci-fi version where you're escaping a pursuer in a simulation and violence becomes computation cycles (messing with the simulation is possible, to astonishing effect, but draws attention to you).
