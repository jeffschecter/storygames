My game, School Daze was mentioned in the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13567&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">Stuff to Watch: January 2012</a>, and it's in its near-final build. Here's the deal: I need to see how it handles. I've gotten a few playtests in, but I need more. The community here at S-G is great for things like this, so I'm hoping that you'll help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool Daze is a narratively driven RPG that uses high school as a vehicle to tell fun stories. Think The Breakfast Club, Brick, Glee, or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's not about re-living high school, it's about making a caricature of it. It plays somewhat like Fiasco, but there is a GM (the Administrator), and there's a light conflict resolution system.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.sandandsteam.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/SchoolDaze.pdf" rel="nofollow">The PDF for the current draft of the rules is here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play it with your group (minimum of two players and a GM), please send your feedback to tracy (at) sandandsteam (dot) net.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat worked for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat didn't work for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat needs clarification?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat shines?<br/>\n<br/>\nI thank you all in advance for giving my game a spin. This is my first time ever doing something like this, so the more feedback I get, the better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
