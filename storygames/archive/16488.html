Anybody done it? If I have a Kindle, and I hit the Kindle Store, or the Apple App Apparatus, can I buy your game there?<br/><br/>I tried looking for 'role-playing games' on the Kindle store, and mainly I found a bunch of nonfiction (eek) and one RPG called the Maiden Saga, which is apparently an erotic RPG (the intro says, "The content is unashamedly erotic, some might even say perverse, so if you believe in cold baths, good clean fun that an author should cloes the bedroom door when things start to get fruity, then you should probably go away, now," and you know what, I'm going to put that entire passage in my next RPG, screw copyright, that's just gold).<br/><br/>Right, yeah, who's doing some tablet/ereader publishing? I searched the topics, didn't find anything at all on Kobo! Nada! And those guys have over a third of the Canadian market share! Big money waiting to happen, no?<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377439/#Comment_377439" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T06:24:40+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  6:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frankly, the ebook formats existing so far are absolutely not RPG friendly: they are perfect for novels and fiction in general (single column/flow of text, minimal text layout, rare illustrations) but very much NOT for something that is much more similar to a cross between an illustrated book and a technical manual like an RPG.<br/><br/><i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> by Evil Hat has been released on Kindle and other ebook formats recently and I'm sure it handles it pretty well because it *is* a single column text with minimal layout. Plus it's been converted by an expert.<br/><br/>Then again, modern tablets can handle PDFs extremely well, so that's a very real alternative: rpg books look VERY nice on my Asus TF101 tablet (10 inch screen, 1280x800). <br/>And with software like ezPdf the user experience is much better than any reader software  for pdfs I've experienced on computers. I can annotate the pdf, for example and I can even easily read double column Letter format pages on my PHONE (SGS i9000, circa 4 inch screen) thanks to its smart zooming.<br/><br/>The future isn't very clear: a "next-generation-epub" format could handle more complex layouts, color e-ink devices should start to surface in the next couple of years... but at the same time, computing power *will* increase. And at that point that e-ink 10" color device will probably render pdfs just fine <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>We'll see, we'll see...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377440/#Comment_377440" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T06:32:02+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  6:32AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I see what you mean about tables and such.<br/><br/>But I'm looking at Fiasco, and the only hiccup I can see are the two-page spreads where you got an image that bleeds from the left page to the right page.

You got an install base for a piece of hardware, and there's this built-in store that people buy their goods at. It's like making a video game, and then saying, okay, we can release it on Steam, but we should also look at PSN or maybe XBLA or whatever. Looking at different markets, different ways of reaching new audiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377446/#Comment_377446" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T06:54:26+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  6:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Considering the general issue, my own take is that rpg publishing needs to change to accomodate the likely technical paths book publishing is going to take in the future. This is mostly in reply to Renato there: the epub format and the HTML base it relies on will continue improving, and it seems likely that it'll be the basis of the universal text presentation standards of the future. Should this be the case I find value in starting to adapt our understanding of what a book is to the HTML format already; it's not too soon to start learning. It might be that some traditional elements of what makes a roleplaying game book, such as ample illustrations, might not make the transfer entirely intact. This is something to consider in detail, not a reason to dismiss the technology and count on PDF because it can replicate a paper book better.<br/><br/>Already today I would like to argue that while an epub file can't be quite as nice-looking as a top-level book, it can be functional and pretty in somewhat different ways: effortless multilinearity provided by hypertext largely makes sidebars and such history, for example. Illustrations <i>can</i> be used, you just need to be critical of where in the text flow you want your illustration to be, and what purpose it serves. Also, epub is a transitional technology right now: I think that it won't be many years before the distinction between fully styled HTML and epub files becomes insignificant; the most current e-readers are already fully conversant with web pages. It is realistic to expect that soon you can make a portable book file with exactly the same range of tools you can use to create nice-looking websites today.<br/><br/>PDF is also a transitional technology in the sense that we're just using it in digital publishing because of a lack of currently functional alternatives. As a long-term solution it's technically a dead end - it's basically a book-lookalike on computer screen, and making it anything else would entail rebuilding the entire file format from scratch. Better to work with something that's developed specifically with multi-platform digital consumption in mind, rather than print publication file wrapper, like PDF is.<br/><br/>(In the spirit of clear communication I should emphasize that I don't say that Renato is wrong or wrong-headed, I'm just laying out my differing view on the likely future directions of the field.)<br/><br/>Regarding Rafael's actual topic I sadly don't have any particularly relevant experiences. I'm more interested in using the open Internet as publishing medium, the walled gardens of the various ebook publishers don't seem that attractive to me. This is part of why the epub standard specifically appeals to me as technology; it's simple and compatible with existing web programming skills, so it offers a more egalitarian promise for ebook publishing than a model where you use proprietary tools from private companies to create different files for different markets. One of you prove me wrong by selling 10 000 copies of your game in the Apple store, though, and I'll be right behind you <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377447/#Comment_377447" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T06:55:04+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  6:55AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My biggest complaints about game rules in e-formats is that, generally, the e-format makes it really hard to flip around and find the chart/table you need, or the ability to find and review a rule you are unsure of.

I mean, just skim the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB#Features" rel="nofollow">ePub Features</a>.

My one, single wish on my wishlist for e-ink readers specifically is support for comic book formats. It's completely idiotic how distanced from real-world use cases the people making these things have to be, when they do have renders for image formats but no support whatsoever for unpacking a e.g. zip file and showing the images within in order. Just about the simplest thing to add, and more practical utility than anything they care to add after epub and PDF support. I'll buy the next e-ink reader that does comic book archive formats immediately.<br/><br/>(And yes, one would think that there would be tools for converting CBR to PDF. Good luck with that.)<br/><br/>But anyway, we are truly living in a transitional era regarding the digitalization of books. I can only imagine that in 10 years or so there'll be entirely ordinary solutions to all of these uncertanties we have now. Just takes time to bootstrap hardware, software and content into some sort of self-supporting triangle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377457/#Comment_377457" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T07:35:56+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  7:35AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 7:36AM by [Deleted User].">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are indeed cbr<br/>\n/cbz readers for android.

Being able to read a text is one thing, but layout is super important in terms of indicating the relative importance of different pieces of information and providing an experience of reading and learning that is pleasant. I don't know how novelists can stomach releasing their books that way, honestly, and whoever invented the current epub format deserves to be jumped in an alleyway by a bunch of graphic designers.  It would have been so easy to make a similar format that was actually pleasant to look at, but they intentionally decided not to, I guess. I have no idea why.<br/><br/>That said, once we get a level of layout functionality in ereaders that at least as good as HTML was in the late 1990s, it may be something worth considering. I did a lot of web design in that era and, while a lot of it wasn't pretty, it was definitely possible to do some interesting and worthwhile things. Plus, I imagine there will be some huge leaps forward that jump quickly past that.  Still, I wouldn't count Adobe out yet. I'm sure their designers can see the writing on the wall. Plus, there are so many documents available as PDFs that somebody will eventually come up with a PDF --&gt; epub conversion that will preserve all the formatting.

I did a lot of web design in that era and, while a lot of it wasn't pretty, it was definitely possible to do some interesting and worthwhile things. Plus, I imagine there will be some huge leaps forward that jump quickly past that.  Still, I wouldn't count Adobe out yet. I'm sure their designers can see the writing on the wall.

An Acrobat-supported document format without explicit paging and simple conversion compatibility with PDF would be just about heavy enough to make for a serious challenger for the XML/HTML-based family of technologies and implementations. I don't believe in that because it's just as obvious to Adobe as it is to everybody else that a massive amount of existing data is already in HTML-like formats, but that doesn't meant that they couldn't figure out some compromises or other niches for their solutions once the page-based PDF paradigm is abandoned. Heck, they could add epub support to Adobe Acrobat right this year if they wanted, and instantly capture the market as the dominant tabletop e-reader software. Add some manipulation tools and even a mediocre PDF-&gt;epub converter, and they'll just about lead the pack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377492/#Comment_377492" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T09:40:01+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  9:40AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 9:41AM by David Artman.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tore Vange</cite>There are indeed cbr/cbz readers for android.</blockquote>I meant Nooks and Kindles, when I said "toy tablets."

Unfortunately it doesn't output straight ePub but a ".ibooks" format proprietary to their bookstore. But the books you can produce with it are pretty slick \u2014 the layout changes with device orientation, with landscape being more fancy and portrait more textual; you can include tables and semi-interactive graphics; and it supports hyperlinks and a glossary.<br/><br/>I tried my hand at adapting the open-source "Free FATE" rules, and you can download the book <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/360302/Free%20FATE.ibooks" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that you need an iPad to use it. Drag the downloaded file to iTunes and then sync your iPad.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's too bad that this is a proprietary format. I think there were some technical reasons (these books do some stuff ePub can't handle) but it's also Apple wanting to hog the books to themselves. On the other hand there's no way they would have released a slick free layout app for creating these if the results worked on anyone's e-reader.<br/><br/>In the long run I think HTML is the way to go (as I understand it, ePub is basically just a subset of HTML 5.)

The more general-purpose tablets all tend to run WebKit-based browsers which have excellent CSS support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377831/#Comment_377831" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T12:30:45+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 12:30PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: snej</cite>ePub is basically just a subset of HTML 5</blockquote>Actually, a special implementation of XML, but close enough.<br/><br/>And I see no reason for e-ink not to support HTML--display technology has little or no impact on file format (aside from playback rendering speeds for animations, of course; but no designers that I know are making animations in their rules... yet). <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377838/#Comment_377838" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T13:09:36+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  1:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff!<br/><br/>But I'd like to get back on track.<br/><br/>Who's published a game to a tablet?<br/><br/>Who's purchased a game through a tablet store (like the Kindle Store)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somelady" title="somelady"><img alt="somelady" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somelady">somelady</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377852/#Comment_377852" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T14:43:27+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  2:43PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not a publisher, and only read some of the responses, but I own a (rooted) nook color and an e-ink nook. The e-ink nook actually reads most pdfs pretty well, but it gets totally messed up by sidebars (it will reflow text and can't tell the sidebar is a sidebar). The screen on the color is big enough that you can read them a screen at a time so the layout is preserved (I don't think it reflows if you try to zoom in)<br/><br/>Couple notes about formats - Anything that's not a kindle can handle epub, and I think pdf. Calibre is generally recommended for converting books between formats, but I've found it to do worse than the native reader on my nook for figuring out game books.  And someone above was complaining about cbz/cbr, this is supported natively on the latest version of the nook color firmware.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
