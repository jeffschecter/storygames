However, in the spirit of support for the Indie Community, double Exposure is NOT asking those hours from us.  Instead they would like us to run 4 games for a free badge.  <br/><br/>So don't worry about the player hours thing. <br/><br/>I'd like to get all the games for this years "Indie Games Explosion" collected by April 15th.<br/>Then I'll have them all on the IGE at Dex COn Schedule that night, then I'll register our games in bulk Wednesday april 18th after everyone has had a chance to look at teh scedule and make changes.  <br/><br/>If you are submitting 4 games and you want a free badge I have the code you need.  <br/>First go to the IGE community Live Journal and submit your games as a reply to this post<br/><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ige/1902.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/ige/1902.html</a><br/><br/>The email me with the Subject: IGE Dexcon Badge<br/>I will reply with the Code you need.<br/><br/>AFTER April 18th<br/>Go to the Double Exposure Dex Con Website here:<br/><a href="http://www.dexposure.com/dexcon10i.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dexposure.com/dexcon10i.html</a><br/><br/>Pre register using the code <br/><br/>Double Exposure is still very much in support of the Indie Community and has given IGE a free room for Gms that need the crash space, and they do feed their GMs very well.

It's a big jump from 2 to 4 games.  Dex Con is Running from Wednesday night to Sunday which for those attending from opening night leaves plenty of room for running and playing.   AND Vinnie is not having us count player hours so it doesn't matter if our games run for 3, 4 or 5 people.<br/><br/>This only effects GM's who need Free badges.  Pre reg is $50 for the whole con, or $40 for from Friday 8pm-Sunday.<br/>AND if you were only planning on being at Dex Con for 1 day and can only run 2 games let me know, I might be able to work something out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63413/#Comment_63413" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-10T11:39:07+00:00" title="April 10, 2007 11:39AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin,<br/><br/>If your only running 2 games and you don't mind buying your own badge,<br/>Send me your game info as a reply to this post,<br/><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ige/1902.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/ige/1902.html</a><br/>and I'll register your games as part of the Group  <br/>Then go to the Dex con site and buy your badge.<br/>They are going to charge $60. at the door, so you'll want to make sure you pre-reg.<br/>-kat<br/><br/>-kat                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63414/#Comment_63414" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-10T11:51:23+00:00" title="April 10, 2007 11:51AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh,<br/>Mel White is a guy.<br/>I'll pass on your email to him and let him know to contact you.<br/><br/>I don't know why the sudden change in policy.

I'd pay for the registration even if I did register to run enough hours.  DexCon 2006 is where I met most of you guys.  DexCon is how I got to feel like I belonged to something.  I've never done enough there to get a free badge, and that's OK by me.  I get to see you jokers.  It's worth it at twice the price.<br/><br/>I admit that on some level I laugh a little (not in a condescending way or anything like that!) when people worry about doing 16 hours of GMing.  I'm thinking back to AmberCon Northwest, where the Evil Hat core crew of the time (Rob, Lydia, myself) would show up and run several 8-hour games, using three GMs, occupying between 12 and 18 players at a time.  4-hours-and-that's-it gaming has always seemed a little lightweight to me by comparison.<br/><br/>No less *awesome*, mind you.  Just smaller scale. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, it's that sort of experience that makes me have a kneejerk, "What's the big deal?  Cut it down to 12 hours and do 5 / 5 / 6 players, or 8 hours and do 8 / 8."<br/><br/>And, yeah, we're not all Luke Crane, but I don't think we NEED to be for the 12-hour version.  The 8-hour version?  Yeah, okay. Point. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Whenever I go over 6 players, I'm definitely into the second GM territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63443/#Comment_63443" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-10T18:55:37+00:00" title="April 10, 2007  6:55PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, Ben, since you asked... I'm pretty happy with this. It always bothered me that folks who only ran a game or two got a free badge, when I was running a bunch. I always ran more events than I really wanted to, because I felt I was picking up the slack from our community. There are 15 gaming slots at DexCon, so you can still run four events and have plenty of time for being a player or hanging out. And if you want your main focus to be playing games or socializing, you can still buy your own badge -- that's the service the convention provides, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn truth, though, this doesn't affect me much, personally, as I'm going to run at least four events, and I usually end up with a free badge from some other source, anyway, so I could slack if I wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua, it's 16 hours of running games, yes, but spread out over five days. It seems pretty reasonable to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKat, is it 4 events from the IGE as an entity per free badge, which we give out in whatever fashion we like? Or is it that each person has to run 4 events to get a free badge? Because I'm sure I'll run more than 4, so some of my "extra" games could make up the difference for someone else. Also, what's the status of LARPs in this? I'm going to run a 4-hour LARP playtest for my Lost Room-inspired system, so I'd like to know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63465/#Comment_63465" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T04:41:20+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  4:41AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew <br><br>Vinnie asked if we could each try to run 4 slots.<br><br>He's not counting player hours which is nice for the gms who only need 3 players.<br><br>As far as Larps Go  if your running a 16-player 8hr Larp or a 32-player 4 hour Larp, then you met the Free Badge Requirements for the non-indie games.<br/><br/>But let me know if your doing a LARP cause that will cut down on the 4 game requirment.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63491/#Comment_63491" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T07:59:50+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  7:59AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just marry a dealer and cover her table for bathroom breaks. <br/><br/>Works for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63799/#Comment_63799" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T09:54:40+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  9:54AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I already married my Gm.
