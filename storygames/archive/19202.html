These seem to lack the two major components of the usual "cheating" illusionism scenario; GM rolls, and target numbers. Without these, it seems like the power of the MC to "cheat" is hamstrung, at least if they attempt to do it as one would in other games. The closest version I can imagine is to just violate our agenda to Play To Find Out What Happens, determining an event to occur regardless of player activity.<br/><br/>In light of the different stance of the system, the usual tricks are mostly gone. I'm sure, however, that the system has its own ways to undermine player action! And I'd like to better understand what they are. I'm interested for a couple reasons:<br/>1) First and foremost, it's my understanding that the advent of player-facing rolls and universally set target numbers are new in comparison to the traditional GM-set dynamic. We've had a lot of time to figure out the kinks of the traditional, but I haven't particularly seen any discussion of this topic.<br/>2) I used to really buy into the appeal of traditional illusionism for its "benefits" (keeping drama high, mitigating intense streaks of bad luck) until I learned about the downsides, where I was undermining player agency. But of course, I didn't use the word illusionism, I didn't know what I was doing! By the same note, there are things I might be doing when I run these games that are pretty bad and I just haven't noticed the consequences.<br/>3) If we know what this new stance on game design's own personal flaws are, maybe we think about how to avoid them. It's not just Apocalypse World after all, or even its hacks - elements of this stance are appearing in other games now, like Numenera. For this reason, while I connoted in the title that this is about Apocalypse World, I totally am interested in any games doing these things.<br/>4) I'm just kinda interested.<br/><br/>To kick off with a little more thinking of my own, could it show up in interpretation of move triggers? Being pretty choose-y about what exactly going aggro means, or what it means for a situation to be "charged," etc. I can imagine an MC (heck, I could imagine <i>me</i>, unfortunately) judging what it means for a Gunlugger to be "in battle" for purposes of NOT TO BE FUCKED WITH based upon how ridiculous that would make them in the scene that's set, rather than the actual situation.<br/>Alternatively, could cheating take the form of writing some slanted (subtly or seriously) custom moves for situations?<br/>These would be things where it could be justified that you're still Playing To Find Out What Happens even, but are clearly trying to exert some control. What are some others.<br/><br/>Oh, and as a side note, does Participationism look any different in this context? Like, where the players agree that you may not use the rules entirely as written in order to keep things fun. It seems like without simple number-shifting, the more preventative reasons for it (eg mitigating poor rolls in critical places) fall apart a bit in my eyes. All that remains that I see are means for the MC to exert control over players, rather than promote their actions.<br/><br/>That's a bunch of stuff so I'll leave it there. I'm really interested to hear what other folks are talking about.<br/><br/>(NOTE: I'm aware that other illusionism threads have been getting Slow Downs pretty regularly - I don't intend this to be a place to argue the pros and cons of illusionism, here I'm just trying to figure out how it would be different in a system that flips the usual conventions on their head.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scramble" title="scramble"><img alt="scramble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scramble">scramble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428053/#Comment_428053" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T02:57:05+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  2:57AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2014 2:57AM by scramble.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't thought much about cheating in the *World games, but I did think about all the ways to adjust the challenge on the fly. My examples are from DW mostly.<br/><br/>1. There are still quite a few things hidden from the PCs. Your Monsters' HP, for example. You can basically let your beasties go down anytime you want. The same goes for damage, but this one is more visible. Having a measly goblin do a d12 of damage is not going to sit well with most players.<br/>2. It's all in the fictional positioning. Describing the opposition as hyper-competent and/or equipped with superior range will produce a few Defy Danger Moves. You wouldn't gave got those if you had just described the baddies as plain old cannon fodder. This is a mild form of the 16 HP dragon that Sage LaTorra wrote about here: <a href="http://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/</a><br/>3. You don't always have to use the hardest move you've got. Even on a miss, you can opt for the softer move, going easier on your players.<br/>4. There are some murky bits in the 7-9 range of moves. What exactly is a hard choice, anyway? "You lose your stuff" is a hard move. "You take damage" is a hard move. Is "You lose your stuff or you take damage" a hard choice? But remember, the "hard choice" move comes from a 7-9 result! This is the mistake I make most often. My hard choices are too hard!<br/>5. I think you could let any villain get away from a fight instead of going down. Force lots of rolls from the players, then play with fictional positioning. Have them tossed through the air, entangled, what have you. Let the villain slip away. This blatantly violates the "looking through crosshairs" bit, of course.<br/><br/>No. 2 would be the best candidate for illusionism. I'd sum it up as<br/>- Massage the fiction to your liking.<br/>- Be aggressive about it.<br/>- Use the line "Life is bad, suck it up" a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428057/#Comment_428057" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T04:38:09+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  4:38AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My understanding is that the GM never rolls in a world game.

The key to *World games is understanding that honesty doesn't demand one specific result, but could demand a range of results. You pick the result which lets you best be a fan of the players.<br/><br/>So if you wanted to look for cheating, it'd be ignoring what honesty says in favor of substituting your own desired outcome. You can do it subtly or not-so-subtly, leveraging the information that players don't know. If you suddenly tell them "moving past this guard requires you to tap into the psychic maelstrom" because you needed to send the plot forward through the maelstrom (and they picked a different path), they won't know any better, unless they're savvy. You're the MC, though, so they trust you to get everything making sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428066/#Comment_428066" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T09:27:18+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  9:27AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I think as others have noted the easiest way and maybe even the only way to cheat in the *world games is to ignore the principles.

(Quite possibly the first being <i>The Pool</i>.)<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is not one of those games. It is much closer to a "traditional" RPG in this sense.<br/><br/>This was a point of controversy when the game first came out: several people saw it as a regression to an older style of play. It was criticized in this respect. The answer, as people have pointed out, is in the Principles. If the MC understands them and is willing to follow them, then railroading-type behaviour shouldn't happen. However, there's no guarantee that a) the MC understands the Principles in the first place, or b) is consistently scrupulous about following them. It would be fairly easy to slip into a more "trad game"-style Illusionist romp.<br/><br/>Having said that, there are a number of features of the system which lend it to being highly player-driven. <br/><br/>* The whole "First Session" concept means that the challenges and contexts of the fictional situation are at least partially authored by the players, and the players have a lot of leeway in choosing *what* the game is about.<br/>* As mentioned before, having the players make all the rolls takes away *some* agency from the MC under certain circumstances.<br/>* The structure of 'moves' being explicitly spelled out guarantees certain possibilities for the players. For instance, the MC cannot say that a certain NPC cannot be intimidated or dominated: the players can always go aggro on that character, and, if they roll well enough, either hurt him badly or force him to do as they say.<br/>* Along the same lines, the lack of difficulty numbers and situational modifiers means that the MC cannot use various math tricks to make an outcome impossible: if a fictional situation exists where you can make one of your moves, the system guarantees you some chance of success, every time.<br/>* So, when you make a move: the system first guarantees you certain (good) odds of success, and then guarantees that you get what you want, or close to it, on a good roll. The MC can't say, for example, that, yeah, you rolled 10+ on that "read a situation" roll, but you just can't see anything important... the MC also can't say, "Ok, you rolled 10+ on that seize by force and chose to seize your objective... but it seems to be more slippery than expected - roll again to see if you can <i>really</i> take hold of it..."<br/>* The design of certain moves gives players the possibility to achieve certain things in the fiction reliably. A perfect example is the "read a person" move: so long as you roll well, you can *always* find out if, say, a certain NPC is lying, or get other types of information. This limits certain types of Illusionism (particularly where NPCs lying to the PCs is a crucial plot point, for example).<br/>* In a more general sense, the whole game is set up so that the player characters have a great deal of agency compared to NPCs. The guarantee of success plays into this, but so does the design of most moves (consider, for example, many playbook moves which allow you to outright kill, seduce, or otherwise influence NPCs without a roll, or something like "Eye on the door", which allows the character to escape any situation without the need for MC approval). Characters advance in power very quickly and gather more moves, which means that their impact on the situation should quickly (or at least eventually) overcome whatever fictional constraints exist. Maybe that warlord is too tough for you to take on, and could easily kick your ass... but wait a few sessions, and you can take a move which kills from a distance on a good roll. So the characters are given greater leverage as the game goes on. This almost inevitably puts them in a place where they can accomplish what they want, sooner or later. (In contrast to a game like D&amp;D, where challenges scale up proportionately with character advancement, and thus the "arms race" remains in balance.)<br/><br/>This is not an exhaustive list; I'm just brainstorming. There are surely some others, as well.<br/><br/>None of these make railroading/similar behaviour completely impossible - they can all be worked around by a suitably hard-nosed MC. But they make Illusionism a much less easy style of play: they'll be working against you.<br/><br/>Edit: in short -<br/><br/>1. Apocalypse World presents a certain written "contract" in the form of its moves. When this happens in the fiction -&gt; we roll these dice, with these numbers meaning a good outcome -&gt; we get a reliable result (as described in the move). A lot of Illusionist behaviour (but not all) is invalidated by this structure.<br/><br/>(In "traditional" Illusionist games, I've often seen GMs deny each of these steps: "No, you don't get to roll here." -&gt; "Yeah, you can roll, but the penalty is so high that you can't succeed." -&gt; "Ok, you got a success, but it turns out it's not good enough.")<br/><br/>2. The whole game is set up so that the leverage available to the characters/players starts out very high and just keeps increasing, so their impact on their milieu is (almost) inevitable.<br/><br/>As for Illusionism, the best places for an MC to apply her leverage to get the fiction to turn out a certain way are:<br/><br/>A. Fictional positioning. Lots of leeway here: you can still do the old "Ok, you won the fight, but it turns out the 'real' guards were around the corner the whole time" thing most of the time, should you wish to.<br/><br/>B. MC moves: on failed rolls, there is no real "contract" as to what failure looks like. The system explicitly gives the MC permission to turn failure into success, for example (so long as you follow the Principles).<br/><br/>C. Be selective about which moves are triggered and when. (The 16 HP dragon is a good example of this: the MC cannot force modifiers on players' rolls or set difficulty numbers, but instead she has a lot of control over which moves are made and when. When a PC attacks the ninja, can he/she roll to Hack &amp; Slash/seize by force, or is the ninja being so menacing that they must roll to Defy Danger just to get in close?)<br/><br/>I'd say that, by the rules, none of these are "cheating" so long as they follow the Agenda and Principles. So, making more guards appear just because you don't want to see the PC break into the vault just yet is cheating. But making more guards appear because that's going to make the PCs' lives more interesting or because that's being honest to your prep, that's all good.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428089/#Comment_428089" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T17:08:44+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  5:08PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2014 5:10PM by JDCorley.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can easily railroad in AW.

In fact, remembering the various permutations of you saying that in various threads informed some of my thinking here, that it IS a normal game and thus GM power-tripping is possible. I'm interested in if that railroading / GM sleight-of-hand changes because of the specific paradigm shifts made by the game - in effect, all player-side rolls and unshifting target numbers, which takes two of the most direct cheating tricks off the table (fudging rolls and difficulties; that's not just a bad idea, by the rules that's usually cheating straight out, it's just not been agreed upon that that's bad in itself). ::)<br/><br/>It seems that, thanks to the move structure, literal numbers cheating has been completely canceled MC-side, and that largely MC power-tripping is now a matter of violating principles. I feel comfortable saying that, as it does seem that many actions can be rationalized with other Principles (for ex, as Paul said, making lives interesting).<br/>So we have move structure and high player leverage acting against the cheater-MC, and fictional positioning, lack of game control over MC move severity, and interpreting triggers as main cheating tricks. <br/>It seems like, since so much of it can be rationalized, the only difference between regular play and illusionist play here is simply intention. There are very few actual behaviors that, without knowing intent, can be declared cheating or illusionism. A lot of that is also true for other traditional games, but those also have many behaviors ("oh, that success wasn't enough" or "you can roll, but you won't succeed" etc) that a player can easily call out as bullshit. The most obvious thing is highlighting poor or never-used stats it seems, which can definitely be called out if they do it (I usually would say <i>a</i> session with a bad stat is fine if it's not a regular thing, but never-used stats shouldn't be highlighted).<br/><br/>Interesting stuff folks! It was interesting to see which Principles particularly came into play in stopping these behaviors. It's fascinating to see the 16 HP Dragon show up here because that's something I really like about DW, so it was interesting how easily it potentially folds into a manipulative practice.<br/>I don't see any major further points I want to prod or question here - if anything it would just be asking if there remains any positive-minded MCs would even consider railroading to be a good option with these games given that your intent has to be manipulative to even make it happen much, and as I called out early on, the typically-cited benefits don't really exist. Framed a different way, I'm asking if there is anything to be gained by a player by consenting to participationism play in a *-world game. But I'd be satisfied if this thread were done here.<br/>Thanks everyone!

The GM is allowed to have input into the game and if he's created a deadly threat the characters have to deal with then they are going to have to deal with it.  It doesnt really become a railroad unless the GM is forcing them along the path, not letting them decide how to react to the threat.  If he allows the players to run away from the disease to a new town or to try and figure out a cure for the disease or if they just ignore it and try and stay away from the sick it's all fine.  It's a railroad if he's planned out that they have to open their minds to the psychic maelstrom where they will learn they have to physically enter the maelstrom to engage in a kungfu fight with the god of disease to end the plague.

I'm especially interested in where that trickery can occur without directly violating Principles - if we start violating principles you have more or less every non-mechanical tool an illusionist has in any game. <br/>That's not to say I'm not interested in seeing how straight violation also shows up in play though. And there's other shapes to cheating, but I guess I am interested in a specific shape of "cheating" here.<br/><br/>Quickly, with regard to not letting you roll, it depends on the situation I think. There are some obvious points, but sometimes it's a lot more subtle, especially with a couple moves like Go Aggro (which has spawned a lovely number of threads about its definition). I see what you mean though, that one can get very visible as well.<br/><br/>Re: pushing a threat: I dunno, that's a tough call if I'd call that railroading! On the one hand, yeah, the GM is allowed to have input, but with badness it's not really something the players can ignore, so it <i>is</i> forcing them a bit.<br/>My path in that situation would be to bring it in during prep, with front creation. That's the place where the book says that the GM is dragging in the bits that they want to see in play, and then once they get to the table they can always say what their prep demands (without pre-playing).<br/>Usually, I wouldn't get too upset about a bunch of calling up impending badness. After all, in the situations where the MC gets to make their moves, there's a lot harder that could be done directly, spending their influence moments on pushing a thing they want to see doesn't seem that bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zedlopez" title="zedlopez"><img alt="zedlopez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zedlopez">zedlopez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428112/#Comment_428112" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T12:32:22+00:00" title="February  7, 2014 12:32PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2014 1:08PM by zedlopez.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read "play to find out what happens" to define railroading as against *World games' rules-as-written, but it allows illusionism just fine (up to whatever point you consider it to cross over into railroading.) Another fundamental is to do what the fiction demands; between that and the amount of flexibility the hard moves offer, there's considerable latitude for steering. Fixed target numbers don't really matter when the GM gets to decide whether there are two or twelve baddies.<br/><br/>I've played other *World games but only run Monster of the Week. If I were running it in a 4-hour slot at a con and the players instantly thought of something clever I didn't anticipate that would give them a shortcut to discovering when and where to find the monster and what its vulnerability is right off the bat, it's darn likely I would invent additional obstacles to frustrate them doing so. Unless maybe I had a better idea for making it hard to act on the information without figuring more things out. Because the fiction demands that the investigation is challenging, and I don't want to deliver a 90-minute game for a 4-hour slot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428114/#Comment_428114" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T14:01:17+00:00" title="February  7, 2014  2:01PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Play to find out what happens" is just a way of playing the game, like "don't railroad" is for Vampire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428115/#Comment_428115" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T14:13:35+00:00" title="February  7, 2014  2:13PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Play to find out what happens" is just a way of playing the game, like "don't railroad" is for Vampire.</blockquote>\nIf I may side tangent: it's interesting how both of these directives are roughly the same, but distinct in their phrasing and approach.

A big thank you for it, Max.<br/><br/>I am currently playing an Operator in a bi-weekly game of AW (still having a light hangover after yesterday's session 4) and I was nodding through the OP and most of the other posts as well. There are moments I totally feel railroaded, stripped of agency, not having a crumble of protagonism.<br/>I experienced the problem as an MC as well: I had my threats and  was not sure what would be the most interesting Move to make. Having a pre-written story is much easier than letting the rules and the players decide everything. It is unfun but easy.<br/><br/>As of now, I identify the key being not understanding the nature of this curious meta-medium, basically the distinction of goals vs tools. Packing it in a nice huge bag of gaming history really helps deepening the misunderstanding but the core idea remains the same: producing fiction is a lot more popular concept (and practice) these days than the idea of producing an experience of that--of the making of a story.<br/><br/>So understanding and acting on it is hard work. The MC is not really cheating, at least usually it is not intentional. They have a whole lot of rules and tasks, I guess much more than in a participationist game. No wonder you forget some of those and start slipping, tumbling towards "I don't know" or participationism/illusionism.<br/><br/>3 examples:<br/><br/>My friend now MC-ing has great Threats and he is able to discard some of them ("look through crosshairs", etc.) but some of those fuckers are much more fiat-protected. The lurker in the dark is not really a lurker in the dark without 3 whole sessions of lurking in the dark, right? No, this is totally wrong in AW. But still. It somehow feels right (if you are not on the pointy end of it) as fiction works exactly this way. We are not exactly writing fiction and this is hard to get.<br/><br/>The second example is about the MC's task of giving equal screen time to the players (and "be the fan of PCs"). The very same things apply as in tradgames. That is if the protagonist player says what is expected, the MC is feeling confident because of knowing the next answer without actually tuning into the conversation or the fiction. If on the other hand a protagonist player says something totally unexpected, something intensively inspiring for the MC, then having fun, he/she gives screen time generously, again. The odd case is when the first answer of the protagonism player doesn't give neither the expected nor the chills--when they want to do something but it requires effort on the part of the MC to be a fan of it. These players (this time it's me, other times it's not) are left behind a lot.<br/><br/>Not recognizing move triggers is another example. When every non-move action is finalized by the MC, the absence of moves results in the possibility of total control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
