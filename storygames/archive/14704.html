I was wondering if anyone has used it and could talk a little about their experiences with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm especially interested in peoples approach to the two banks of points, whether you've had campaigns that could last awhile with those points humming in the background.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
