That's really good, but it's all internal to the characters. What can I do, as a narrator, to prompt that internal journey?<br/><br/>The obvious thing to do is to present situations where something's gone wrong because someone is rebelling against society's rules, and the PCs have to deal with the consequences, perhaps putting things right. That's sort of DitV territory, but without the PCs having any mandate to step in and change things.<br/><br/>So, any other suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445829/#Comment_445829" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-28T20:40:31+00:00" title="June 28, 2015  8:40PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let the Player collaborate, knowingly or unknowingly?

It's often hard, maybe harder than agreeing to play a character that is flawed, because in longer-format games you only start "feeling" your character after a couple of sessions.<br/><br/>My first instinct would be to get the players' buy in - make sure that they want to start with flawed characters and play through a story of overcoming that flaw (specifically, "Avatar: the Last Airbender" comes to my mind as an example of such a story, where a group is on a quest but also each character deals with their individual issues).<br/><br/>[Then I would grab Burning Wheel and ask the players to create characters that have a completely reasonable Belief about not wanting to follow a rule - maybe "I'm just a kid, someone else will take care of it" (assuming responsibility?) or "It was just a joke, don't take it so seriously!" (compassion?) or "You can't tell me what to do!" (learning to cooperate?) - and then plan a game that challenges those Beliefs. I don't have Ryuutama yet so I don't know how it works there. However without player buy in, even mechanics may have no bite, like TBZ Fates.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445840/#Comment_445840" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-29T12:40:44+00:00" title="June 29, 2015 12:40PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

Like, every few sessions, have a "campfire" moment where you have them reflect on it. A bit like how in Mouse Guard and Torchbearer, you have the Winter phase where players reflect on how their characters have changed, and assign new traits accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445854/#Comment_445854" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-30T09:38:56+00:00" title="June 30, 2015  9:38AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One traditional way to do this in fantasy fiction is metaphor.

It'd be very easy to posit one of those traits along the lines of "every character must name a challenge they're trying to overcome or character trait they want to gain/shed", and then once you've done that...\n<blockquote>One traditional way to do this in fantasy fiction is metaphor.

By default, Ryuutama terrain is somewhat naturalistic (like, no fields of poppies that make you sleep or swamps that trap the despairing), but there's really nothing STOPPING you from going this route either.
