I personally find that they encourage me toward both strategy and roleplaying.  That's good.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I notice <i>a lot</i> is that when you're in the midst of one of these resolution sessions, <i>something else</i> always seems to come up.  Some minor, unrelated, point crops up that normally you'd use the resolution mechanic to deal with ... but you can't, because you're already using the resolution mechanic for something else.  These are only noticeable when they're not in line with the current resolution, but rather at right angles ...<br/>\n<br/>\nEXAMPLE:  John serenades Lilith from outside her window.  Long-term resolution is about whether or not he wins back her love.  Short-term, however, it starts to rain.  Someone wants to know whether John gets seriously sick from hanging about in the cold rain singing up to Lilith ... but how to resolve that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking of making some rules where there is a main resolution mechanic, and then a smaller, faster resolution mechanic for "side bets" ... specifically to quickly resolve those issues that arise at right angles to the main question.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">EXAMPLE:<br/>\nJ: "Okay, I'm playing a five to win Lilith's love."<br/>\nL: "Nine to resist."<br/>\nJ: "Another five.  That's a pair, which trounces your singleton."<br/>\nL:  "Add the ten ..."<br/>\nJ: "You going for the three-card straight?"<br/>\nL: "Wait and see.  In the meantime, it starts pouring rain.  I think John gets really freakin' sick."<br/>\nJ: "Uh ... no way.  It's just rain."<br/>\nL:  "Side bet?"<br/>\nJ:  "Sounds good.  1 ... 2 ... 3 ... and reveal!  I play a queen on the side bet."<br/>\nL:  "King!  Suck it!"<br/>\nJ:  "Ah shit!  KACHOO!  He collapses mid-verse.  Do you have the straight?"<br/>\nL:  "Nah, I was just shittin' you.  Lilith sees him fall, and love wells up in her heart ... she could never really hate him!"<br/>\nJ:  "Great.  Just great.  That'll be a tremendous comfort when he's sweating off a body-wracking fever.  Man, Lilith is so much more trouble than she's worth."</div>\n</blockquote>\nSo, questions arise in my mind about this:  Should there be some restriction that the side-bet be in some way <i>smaller</i> than the main bet?  Or is making it independent/"at-right-angles" enough to keep things coasting smoothly?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it needn't be smaller, do you think that people might use the side-bet to short-cut a major show-down on a contentious point?  Or would that just get popcorn thrown at them?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it needs to be smaller, how does one quantify that?  What if it seems much smaller to one person, but much larger to another?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84236/#Comment_84236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T07:59:34+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  7:59AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can the side-bet influence the main resolution.

At some point in the fight a side bet is placed, "the bus that Mr. Monster just missed with is flying towards a little girl, will it crush her?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the side bet can't I guess the limiting factor should be the scope of the conflict resolution in game.

You've already <i>got</i> a system that's working out the questions of the main resolution.  If the question is "Does the rain make John's performance stink so that he fails to win Lilith's love?" then that's just a step in the multi-stage main resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would sort of imagine that anyone could introduce them.  To be <b>true</b> side bets, in the gentlemans-club connotations of the phrase, the bet should be between two <i>completely uninvolved</i> bystanders.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike, John and Lilith are doing a conflict about the romance, but Ted and Rory make a side bet about whether John will be deathly ill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly would want such a side-bet to be possible, but I'm not pushing to make it exclusive.  I think that side-bets between John and Lilith, or John and Ted, or Lilith and Rory, or whatever, should still be possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scope thing ... yeah ... that's the thing that's buggin' me about this.  I agree, a main resolution of "Do I sneak into the movie theater?" with a side-bet of "Is the world consumed with apocalyptic hell-fire?" seems odd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84383/#Comment_84383" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T15:11:08+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  3:11PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is cool.<br><br>Are side bets a kind of complication that can be introduced into the characters' lives, separate from the outcome of the main conflict?<br><br>Perhaps if you had a complications mechanic going anyway (I do), and the side bet mechanic gets activated when a complication comes up?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84384/#Comment_84384" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T15:14:47+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  3:14PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, if the side bet mechanic uses the same resources that the main resolution system uses, it can be used to siphon off resources from the main conflict.

Who ever wins the sidebet gets to add these beads to his characters beadpool. So if you want to prevent John from getting sick, you've got to pay up to make sure. And if you don't mind taking this, then you get a greater chance of winning future conflifts, despite having to deal with the flu.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on one hand you get more currency and you get a complication (more fun), on the other you get to prevent a complication to facilitate your story goal (woe Lillith) but it costs you currency, psuhing you to invest in sidebets with others to gain this back.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeeds sorting out of course.

Make it something that (ideally) helps the person winning more than it hurts them.  Maybe it harms the losing party, maybe it helps them (or, maybe, it only helps them to the extent that they actually play hard ... though that's harder to code for in a simple system).  But, in any event, if it helps the winning player as much as or more than it helps the losing one than nobody's going to jump into that kind of conflict in order to drain resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a system where you're playing cards in the main conflict, for instance, maybe the winner of the side bet gets to pick a card at random from your hand and take it into their own.  Or something.  Getting the right balance between a death spiral (winner continues to win) and a pendulum (winner loses next time) would depend on all the other elements going on in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still not sure I have a good handle on what the <i>scope</i> of the side bet should be allowed to be, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans" title="Hans"><img alt="Hans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans">Hans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84540/#Comment_84540" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T06:57:28+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  6:57AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2007 6:57AM by Hans.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you tie the side bets into currency that can affect the main conflict, another question to consider is how and when side bets can be initiated.  I don't think you want a situation where there is incentive to keep milking the side bet system in hopes of a way to win the big conflict; you want side bets to stay on the side.<br>\n<br>\nHaving thought a lot about With Great Power... recently, here is an idea: when I propose a side bet, it must be a "bad" thing that will lead to short term "good" but long term complication.  This puts my opponent in the position of fighting me to keep something "bad" from happening to me on the side bet.  In your example above, the difference would be that JASON would be the one proposing the rain and sickness, not his opponent.  <br>\n<br>\nJ: "here's a side bet, it starts to rain, and my character is going to be drenched and end up really sick.  But Lilith will take pity on me and let me get into the house to get close to her."  <br>\nL: "No way, what is this, a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan movie all of the sudden?  Bet's on!"  <br>\n<br>\nHow exactly one defines "bad" and what long-term complication it involves is, of course, tricky.  <br>\n<br>\nPerhaps the side bet is not so much about whether the "bad" thing happen or not.  If the bet is accepted the "bad" will happen.  The bet is about how much mechanical complication it will cause me in the future.  In the example above, this would be how much the sickness screws with my ability to afffect the story in the next scene(s).  Under this scenario, a side bet would have some kind of fixed short term benefit in the current conflict (maybe an extra card).<br>\n<br>\nSince its Tony who started this, I just have to say (facetiously)...aren't all conflicts in Capes side bets?  Or are they all main resolutions?  Capes handles both "Goal: I sneak into the movie theater"and "Event: World is destroyed by apocalyptic hell-fire" at the same time and allows the players to decide (by which they are rolling on) which is the main thing and which is the side bet.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84556/#Comment_84556" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T07:48:04+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  7:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans:  Yes, conflicts are all side-bets relative to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn theory that's an optimal structure, with maximum freedom.

I mean, you're going to have to do this other resolution before or after the "main" one. Well, if you're doing it before hand, aren't you just deferring the main one? If you do it after, aren't you just doing another contest? <br>\n<br>\nAnd shouldn't the stake-setting of such a contest merely be commensurate with the contest? Instead of artificially less or different somehow based on the main contest? <br>\n<br>\nI'm all for multi-stage contests, or even for Pre-contests such as "Variable Augments" in HQ which are contests to get a bonus for the main contest. But barring the contest having an effect on the "main" resolution, I'm failing to see the advantage to having some special mechanics for such resolutions. <br>\n<br>\nNow if you had some condition that forced one of these to occur mechanically, or some sort of reward for putting one in or such (to get the sort of synthesis outcomes that you're giving examples of), that might make sense.

For a mechanic, I'd be just looking at a way to handle the situations (here's a side-bet, it helps side A.  Here's a side-bet, it doesn't help either side but establishes a point), rather than capitalizing on it or encourage it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96305/#Comment_96305" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T09:14:44+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  9:14AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 9:18AM by Valvorik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that there needs to be a "single resource pool" for the conflict if side bets allow "re-arguing what was just won" (e.g., a dice pool in Dogs or Reign).  Which I suspect means it's not really a side bet anymore it's just the give and take of the dice pool being spent and/or the bringing of an additional trait/character aspect into play adding dice to the pool.<br><br>If the side bet is about something that is not the same conflict, it's about creating a more complex situation that changes the nature of the base conflict, then I find it more interesting and worth the expenditure on time creating/running mechanism.<br><br>I've been reading in parallel lately "encounter" (gamist scene) design advice and "bang" (narrativist scene) design advice to see where they are "meta scene advice".  The gamist encounter advice "make it interesting by having more than one thing going on, in addition to the goblins that want to kill the PC's, the fire is creeping closer to the winter food supply for the village, and there are the children hiding in the corner that the goblins haven't noticed yet".  In a way these are over-lapping since in this context the other things will usually pull resources (limited time for actions) away from what would otherwise be a single objective (still making it interesting in seeing what then players spend resources on, being thus a kind of "Bang" in fact depending on whether there are values implicit in them) but they introduce different objectives and stakes into the scene not just different approaches to resolving the core stakes (e.g., adding two more buildings that may burn down ups stakes but doesn't add different ones).<br><br>What makes something still "side bet" is that it's not stealing the show from the stars of scene.  If this is Bob's scene to deal with his father's killer, don't create simultaneous conflicts that overshadow Bob.<br><br>To me what would be interesting about side bets is:<br><br>- If they bring different stakes (not just escalated stakes) into a scene that are a way of involving more players/characters in a scene (e.g., my character doesn't really care much about the core conflict but if we create another conflict flowing alongside it/out of it that does interest my character then I'm not off peering in the fridge), but as noted respect any established emphasis the core stakes was to have.<br><br>- If they bring different play agendas into a scene to appeal to different sensibilities that may be present at table (including in the same player), such as seeing if the immediate objective of saving kids from risk is favoured over the longer term objective of saving entire village from threat of starvation.<br><br>- If they create multiple possible fall-outs from a conflict which create that much more grist to be player choice to follow up on in play that follows on naturally from the consequences of prior play (e.g., players can pass by entirely the question of what the village eats next winter or can decide they are very concerned about that question in addition to whatever is going on with goblins).<br><br>- If they are way of escalating conflict in the scene ~ though escalation can lead to meltdown if over-used and I would like to see the above three used more often than escalating single stakes (more kids and grainaries added rather than additional buildings possibly burning down).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
