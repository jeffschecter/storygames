It's still in development depending on when I'm gonna have a chance to play it again.<br/><br/>There is an Interdimensional Federation (which is rather an agency, a treaty among countries, rather than a political state) which can access each and every possible setting in enough places and times to have access to any era and distinct setting. They are the good guys and their central is on present day Earth. They hire agents to do some jobs. The Federation is messing with such complex things that they won't or can't tell the agents about the motivation behind the quests.<br/><br/>Each PC is an agent of this Federation and can be of any possible setting. The players are even encouraged to use their favorite characters from a book or movie. You can be Darth Vader.<br/><br/>The system is Fate. Each PC has 5 aspects at the beginning which answer these questions (if I remember right):<br/><br/>- What is your specialty? (The characters are hired by the Federation because of their specialty.)<br/>- How do your character cope with the problems his/her specialty causes?<br/>- What is your character's connection to the Interdimensional Federation? (The Federation is not defined by the game, it is defined by this aspects of all the characters of the actual party. If different players attend, it will be a different Federation.)<br/>- What is your character's connection to the present day Earth? (After this, your player won't be able to speak out of character again.)<br/>- What role does your character seems to have? (This is an evocative word to describe a fictional "character class", like "cowboy" or "ninja".)<br/><br/>I don't use any skill lists, but maybe it would be good to use some setting specific skill lists. But I would really need some algorithm to make them, because it would be immense to make them without any automatism or routine. The players had trouble to come up with skills, so I rather use the skill ladder instead of the pyramid, but I'm thinking about enforcing their connection to the aspects (I didn't really asked for it) and make up some rules to define them.<br/><br/>Each and every session is an episode on a different setting and era. The play starts with the PCs already on their quest. I really much use some story games methods (kibitzing, forced scene framing, cooperative play, etc.). I always tell everything the players have to know, the adventures aren't about them finding out what to do and what is happening, but it is about wonderous things happening. I'm not constrained at all by rules books and continuity, so I can anytime GM an adventure in Star Wars which end with the Super Stardestroyer arriving or I can anytime make the strongest man of the world or the king of the known universe appear if I want without hesitation.<br/><br/>It really helped me to GM even in a setting which has loads of details, because this is just one version of it, and next time I won't be bound by continuity if I we "return".<br/><br/>Of course there are plenty of possibilities for people who want more: meeting the mirror agents of the mirror image of another Earth's Federation, or if I want some overarching badasses, I can call them "Intergalactic Empire" as the evil version of the Federation.<br/><br/>Maybe I forgot something, I will fill it in later. Try it if you like it, have fun, tell me how was it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
