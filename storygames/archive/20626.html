Let's also put aside other types of gaming fun that folks may shoot for, and just focus the conversation on supporting immersionist ( in character) fun.<br/><br/>Further, I'd like to focus on rules-lite design. I'd like to keep it there because I think there is ample evidence that people can achieve immersion even with heavy mechanical designs. I want to talk about the other end of things.<br/><br/>One of the things that I like which has come out of dirty-hippie-indie design is the concept of hard-coding things that otherwise tend to end up as advice or Best Practices in more mainstream designs.<br/><br/>Here's my example of something that might appear in a GM advice section of a more mainstream design:<br/><br/><i>To help your players really get into the setting and envision the scene, be sure to use more senses in your descriptions than just what the characters see.</i><br/><br/>Hardcoding it dirty-hippie style might look more like:<br/><i>When a GM sets a scene, they <b>must</b>use at least two of the five senses when describing it.</i><br/><br/>Okay, that's my cheap and dirty example.<br/><br/>What are some of yours, and how could that fit into a rules lite/mechanically lite design, meant specifically to support Immersionist fun and do it easily?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452691/#Comment_452691" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T14:38:18+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  2:38PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2016 2:53PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically it is very easy to support immersion, by not doing the things that tend to disrupt it.<br/><br/>My crunchy mostly-trad game Soul's Calling (a work in progress) is built around the idea of supporting immersion. Many of the techniques it uses could easily be ported into a rules-light RPG. One of them is that before the game the GM gets everyone to close their eyes and envision being their characters, answering (privately, in their heads) various questions as their characters would, such as "what really matters to you right now?" and "why?". In this process each player is encouraged to privately identify and focus on a "golden motive", their PC's single core drive and burning desire. <br/><br/>Another tip is that you can require each PC to have an identifiable voice and identifiable mannerisms, to help people get in the zone.<br/><br/>My "trindie" game Implodarc (also a work in progress; willing playtesters please identify yourselves!) is intended to be rules-light (by my yardstick, which is still pretty crunchy to some people) and supportive of immersion for those who want it as well as other styles. The main thing is <b>not</b> having intrusive social mechanics. The game does have social mechanics, but they have been designed to work around immersion rather than disrupting it. Simply put, you roll before the interaction takes place, and the roll merely biases the GMing of the scenario. Because many people find it easier to maintain immersion when their knowledge mirrors that of their character and when they can be involved in the game at all times, I use the concept of the Deputy GM (in the Intro to the Implodarc book) so that you can split the players into two groups but keep both groups fully occupied, when the PCs are split as a group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452692/#Comment_452692" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T14:49:23+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  2:49PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically make a game that fades into the background and just lets you run theater of the mind style in character sessions. The less the players and GM notice the mechanics, the more immersive it will probably be. Having any kind of requirement, even the one in the OP, could potentially trip that up (because you always have to do it, even when it doesn't feel right or might be completely unnecessary). I tend to go very minimal when it comes to describing things, precisely because I don't want my players focusing on my words, I want them imagining things as immediately as they can. General advice I would give is the system should always give way to the realities of the table. If you have to shoehorn a mechanic in, it is more likely to interfere with immersion.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452693/#Comment_452693" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T14:55:17+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  2:55PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I have said elsewhere, you can do a lot worse than pure freeform, when it comes to supporting immersion!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452694/#Comment_452694" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T15:06:34+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  3:06PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, outside of "pure freeform" let's come up with some mechanics that can, potentially, <i>help</i> with immersion. As discussed in the other indie games thread, there are plenty of people (myself included) who don't care about the details of a very granular / specific skillset of my character - such as hacking a computer terminal or piloting a complex starship. What <i>would</i> pull me out of my immersion as my character is reminding myself (out of character) that I don't actually know what I'm doing. <br/><br/>I want to say, confidently, that my character knows what she's doing and is capable of pulling it off, because they're a star-pilot-hacker. If I had to adequately describe or justify through out of character knowledge those abilities, then that would pull me out of the situation. <br/><br/>The flip of that is the GM/group/self-adjudication part. Would my character be able to pull this off? Yes, no, maybe, etc. I think for a very rules light approach, you'd have essentially three bands of difficulty that the GM/group/self would decide upon:<br/><br/>- Is it impossible for <i>this</i> character to fail at <i>this</i> specific action in <i>this</i> specific context? If yes, don't roll. If no, roll.<br/><br/>- Is it possible for this character to fail, but also possible to succeed? If yes, roll.<br/><br/>- Is it impossible for this character to succeed? If yes, don't roll. If no, roll. <br/><br/>Basically you'd have a possibility spectrum - Impossible to Fail, Challenging, and Impossible to Succeed. The game would reside strictly in the "Challenging" band, if your specific character would always succeed at this particular task then there's no need to engage with a randomizer or specific mechanics, and the reverse is true also. It's just those finnicky middle parts, and that's where some interesting tension comes into play. <br/><br/>Continuing this train of thought, a very simple system that employed some sort of Rank or Modifier for particular Skills or Action groups:<br/><br/>- 1d6 + Mod<br/>If even rolling a 1 the character would always succeed, then don't roll.<br/>If even rolling a 6 the character could never succeed, then don't roll.<br/>Otherwise, roll. <br/><br/>So you'd have mods say of -2 to +4, and Difficulty TNs of 1 to 11. A totally maxed out character might roll 1d6+4 for a particular action, so anything with a TN of 5 or less wouldn't necessitate a roll. <br/><br/>Likewise a character with 1d6+1 could never accomplish a task with TN of 8 or more. <br/><br/>I'm not sure this system above would be particularly fun, but I could see it working and essentially "getting out of the way" in a concrete, unobjectionable way. The only question would essentially be "What TN is this thing?"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452703/#Comment_452703" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T16:16:51+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  4:16PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If even rolling a 6 the character could never succeed, then don't roll.</blockquote>\nIf another character (or another player!) suggested the action, and if even rolling a 6 the character could never succeed, don't roll, and the character's player may disdainfully (or whatever) state that such a thing is nigh impossible and only a non-expert would think it is possible.

By "interesting" I mean something that is likely to compel people's imaginations and make them want to experience it. By "static" I mean that the overall situation depicted in the fiction is not prone to change of disruption; there may be activities, but they are part of the routine, not its end. By "low entry threshold" I mean that you need to be able to organize a gaming group with sufficient entry-level knowledge of the fiction you'll be playing without too much trouble.<br/><br/>Once you've got something along these lines (think <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, or whatever it is that floats your boat), the majority of the design work will concern the activities of the GM, who is the only player upon whom we may make actual demands of learning and conforming - everybody else will be allowed Immersion, which pretty much implies that they will not be useful participants in "running" the game in terms of learning and applying systems. Therefore the game will necessarily be built upon an auteuristic model of creative responsibility: the GM presents the players with the chance to immerse.<br/><br/>The things we can design here fall into two important categories:<br/><b>*</b> Analytical structuration of the setting material we chose earlier; there needs to be a game plan for how, what, when the GM is going to present to the players. What kinds of activities occur in the game? How often, in what order? What kinds of Color has to be delivered? All this material can be proffered for the GM in the form of structured lists and tables and even adventure design sheets and tables they can use to compose their own content and game plan for when they'll need to become the holodeck during the actual session of play. This is not mere setting design in the traditional sense of writing fiction; the fiction can also be structured for the GM's optimal use, and that's where the majority of the game design for this sort of thing lies.<br/><b>*</b> Advice for how the GM should conduct himself during gameplay, perhaps with exercises they can use to improve their performance. What is conventionally considered "rules" falls into this category, but because we want to go rules-light, what we want to do is to not make the players worry about the rules. Rather, they will be rules of conduct and strategic initiatives for the GM; sort of like if Apocalypse World had the GM moves but not the player moves. These are things like "ask the player explicitly for a decision, so as to help them get in the mindset of their character".<br/><br/>I think that with this recipe there is no particular reason why one couldn't accomplish a highly immersive, rules-light game. I've friends who play in this exact manner, though without any game-text support. The weak point here is trust in the GM, but that is a) something we can design for (in the second category of design above: e.g. start the game with some trust exercises or other didactics), and b) often enough caused by creative agenda conflict when a player is not satisfied by the creative contract of the game as presented here.<br/><br/>I think that it is a shame that games in this mold have not been designed very often and very well. In fact, considering game texts, I think that something like <i>Ars Magica</i> beats the pants off most of the rules-light immersion games <i>in their own game</i>: it's got the appropriate type of static immersive setting, it's got the highly-supported princess play, many, many GMing tools and all - you could strip out all the dice and character sheet tomfoolery and still end up with a better rules-light immersion game than most of the actually dedicated texts I've seen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452713/#Comment_452713" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T17:39:54+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  5:39PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2016 5:41PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>, the game doesn't have to be immersive for <b><i>all the players bar the GM</i></b>; why can't it be immersive for all the players <b><i>bar the GMing team</i></b>? As I've said upthread, the Deputy GM is a key tool in making the game maximally immersive for the pure players. Sometimes this can be because for the sake of a player's own immersion each player is, as you suggest, allowed free reign - to the extent that that player is not required to help the other players' immersion. So you can have a table with five people not <b><i>consciously</i></b> contributing to anyone else's immersion, and only one person (the GM) <b><i>consciously</i></b> doing so; that's fine of course because the players are still subconsciously doing lots of things that tend to help each other's immersion, but it may be that bit better for those five players that you add a seventh person, the Deputy GM, who helps the GM in making the game immersive for the other players. I would even go so far as having two Deputy GMs and one GM for four pure players. This also helps make the game more inclusive for friends of yours who are not looking for immersion; the Deputy GM's toolkit is much the same as the archetypal storygamer's and quite similar to a GM's.<br/><br/>@ other posters upthread, personally I find it counterimmersive if a significant action has an absolute certainty of failure or success with no possibility of the GM in his discretion deciding to require a roll - however I prefer to design mechanics that allow that chance of failure or success to be almost negligible (say, around 1 in 144 for some tests in Soul's Calling; harder to calculate for Implodarc but possibly a much smaller probability given how the dice "implode" in a complicated way), provided that there is at least some chance.

"Something to do" sounds, to me, that it's something physical, but "taking an active part" could be active listening, forming a picture in the participant's head, or something similar to that.<br/><br/>As I said <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/452128/#Comment_452128" rel="nofollow">in a previous thread</a>, getting engaged/immersed is done in a circular way. The more information the person gets, the more the engagement will grow (shortly explained).<br/><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/116235159947041206206/posts/Aap3bp7fhM3?pid=6158015892997407442&amp;oid=116235159947041206206" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TKcXhWEVxoQ/VXWq0_9SAtI/AAAAAAAAAaU/i2bop8MgVPkrr-cZm3W9M3uZSh3tT0fBACL0B/w755-h333-no/gameprocess1.png"/></a><br/><br/>Here is another way of looking at it, this time from a video game perspective.

Repeat.<br/><br/>The interaction of the game will then be about taking the characters' personality traits into account. The goal for the player could be something else, like enjoying the story, experience how the group will grow together, or survive the zombie outbreak.<br/><br/>That's how I would design the game, anyway. <b>Montsegur 1244</b> is an example of how it's done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452737/#Comment_452737" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-28T14:07:12+00:00" title="April 28, 2016  2:07PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2016 2:13PM by komradebob.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some great stuff so far folks.<br/><br/>Eero: Man, that's really good stuff, and pretty much where my mind was going.

The GM preps a number of interesting miniatures for the players to choose from as the chassis for their respective unique snowflake characters, and afterwards works hard to affirm and legitimize the player's princessing, whatever form it takes, all in an effort to make them actually like their miniatures.

Another common consideration is street glamour action hero stuff, like World of Darkness and Cyberpunk 2020 and so on.<br/><br/>An acquaintance of mine in Helsinki has been working on and off on a game about dragons for a while now. I think that that's a pretty clever and compelling idea for a princess game: each player gets to set up their own dragon with its color schemes and horns and magical theme and obsessive behaviours, and then they're set loose in the fantasy world to wreak havoc, eat prey animals and sit on enormous mounds of gold. The game basically consists of talking funny, bickering with dwarves and intimidating puny mortals. Like Ars Magica for dragons, as I've characterized it.<br/><br/>Myself, I am particular to literal princesses. Somebody write that game up (solid design, please - I won't be impressed by stat+skill) and I'll pitch it here to drum up some playtesting.

(No, I'm not sure if fixed-length is compatible with princess play; I suspect that it would be, provided you offer the players the chance to <i>truly</i> depict their character concept thoroughly in the climax, but the rpg culture associates these two ideas with different historical camps, which makes it difficult.)<br/><br/>I'd drop the team-based paradigm, though, and insert some tension over adventuring vs. court, so as to support merely <i>being</i> a princess from time to time. Like, maybe each player gets to independently choose between "adventure" and "court" at the beginning of each session (simultaneously reveal playing cards or such to make it a truly independent choice, maybe), and that's what their character does this time, and that's what provides the structure for this session of play. And every characters has their own mythology - what kind of kindom they are the princess of and so forth - so there's plenty of NPC cast to fuel all sorts of bickering and adventures. By making it a subjective player right to switch over every session if they want, you avoid locking the PCs down by setting logic, while still fully actualizing the idea that your character can be a "princess" with ball-gowns and marriages and perfection of being. The basic creative proposition of such a game would have to be that yes, you get to be both a protagonist and a symbol, in whatever mixture you feel like today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452757/#Comment_452757" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-28T19:11:00+00:00" title="April 28, 2016  7:11PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ars Magica style troupe play, with Princess subbing in for Mage, but with each player still having their special companion and some colorful/humorous grogs ( or pets or animated dinnerwear or whatever)?<br/><br/>Heck, howabout that inverted set up where there's the princess and companions on an adventure, but it floats around who the focus princess on an adventure is from session to session?<br/><br/>And how is it that these very diverse Princesses from different times/places/genres can get together to discuss their lives while have Magic Princess Tea Parties?

Not that it's impossible for players to princess it up together as a joint project, but e.g. the Ars Magica covenant doll-house is probably a more straightforward way for multiple players to contribute to a joint princessing project than suggesting that the different characters are one character.<br/><br/>Maybe the entire campaign consists of "arcs" bookended by a framing narrative where the princesses <i>are</i> all together in one place, because congregating tends to be what royalty does. So, at the beginning of play the players determine the occasion for the ball (maybe somebody's getting married?), and then they launch into an extended 1-3 session adventure flashback or several, and then at the end of the arc return to the framing narrative. In the next arc they are again together for some other occasion, again ready to reminisce about what's happened to them since their last meeting. Like <i>Baron von Munchausen</i>, except with princesses.<br/><br/>The weakness to that sort of structure would be that the players would have to compromise on their personal princess-time, though. Well-used, the troupe-methodology could be effective on spotlighting each character in turn, but the price is that you might spend many sessions hardly playing your princess at all as the story follows other princesses. It's probably psychologically more satisfying if every player get their fill of princess play in every session; less build-up and impatience and such, and I'm pretty confident that it's not a fundamental scheduling problem to fit a satisfactory amount of princessing for every player in every session. (By my experience it's quite possible to get your hit of this particular imagination-entertainment in five minutes, as long as it's the right five minutes. Often everything else is just set-up for allowing you to play your princess just right in that crucial moment.)<br/><br/>Without putting all the princesses in one party, perhaps play could occur in sort of short vignettes round-robin around the table, with fictional time spent in e.g. weekly chunks. So you could have a quick succession of social scenes, some adventurous mishaps, then perhaps segue into some more complex (and multiple-princess-encompassing) centerpiece event that takes up most of the session, whether a royal ball or a civil war. Sort of like Ars Magica long-term play, except instead of seasons its weeks because princesses lead a much more interesting life in a much shorter time-span than wizards <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Or, maybe going all Sailor Moon on it is the most feasible solution. Party-based princess gaming has a long and worthy history, and it seems to me that there are certain subtle advantages to it. For instance, the negotiation over spotlight ("is it my time to shine yet") is more organic and allows more freedom when the fictional situation has all the characters sort of follow each other around. This leaves the players a lot of freedom for their individual psychologies: this guy gets his rocks off by micro-managing the everyday and being an organizer, so let him do that, while this other one is happy as long as his character gets to be the mysterious necromancer who's more mysterious than your character, so he'll be happy as long as there's an opportunity to be mysterious every few scenes, even in passing. A single plot, a variety of situations to highlight each character, and everybody is happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452762/#Comment_452762" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-28T20:56:06+00:00" title="April 28, 2016  8:56PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if you are going to use terms like Princess Play and Magic Tea Party, you might want to check and see if your personal biases are at work.

I know I'll certainly be GMing it with that creative premise in mind.<br/><br/>I don't know that anybody outside of the local circles would have really talked about princess play specifically... I think that the concept came up sometime in the tail end of the '00s at Story Games (or maybe at the Forge). Can't remember who named it - could've been me or Jason Corley or some other jackass with a shall we say ironic relationship to the self-importance of gamers. The reference is directly to the gender study notion that boy and girl cultures may emphasize <i>being</i> and <i>doing</i> respectively; "princess play" would then be a kind of static, emblematic play that focuses more on expressing character and less on plot and struggle, just like a "girl movie" might be more about showing how pretty the princess is, vs. a "boy movie" showing how the prince fights his way out of all sorts of dangers.<br/><br/>For the record, I personally have nothing against princesses, and think that playing princess is just as legit as playing cowboys and indians insofar as childhood games go. I know that I've said it before, but it bears repeating: as we're a widely disparate bunch here, from different parts of the world, it is not a given that everybody uses feminine references in a disparaging way. It wouldn't even make any sense to get chauvinistic about princess play, considering how very, very princess-y some core gaming culture games are. Vampire: the Masquerade and modern D&amp;D are both simple examples of games that, I think, are enlightening to consider in this theoretical framework. If princess play is for sissy boys, then so's the entire hobby <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>As a non-gendered alternative, the term "unique snowflake" has some currency as a description of a princess play player character. It's usually used in a somewhat negative context, though, as a description of unwanted uniqueness and baseless spotlight hogging and grandstanding - all behaviors that are the meat and bones of this style of play, but that also become a problem if the game is supposed to be about e.g. problem-solving instead of looking cool for the cameras.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452766/#Comment_452766" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T04:32:51+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  4:32AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am sure somewhere between 'princess play' and 'unique snowflake' exists a label that is neutral.

Hopefully this doesn't come off as curt. <br/><br/>Because this is a case where the terminology comes loaded with critique of the style itself. It is like Euro is enjoying immersion ironically, not because Euro genuinely wants immersion. Perhaps it isn't the case. But as someone who values immersion, reading this thread, it comes off as if it is written by folks hostile to immersion or who don't quite grasp it. The term is part of it. But it goes deeper than that. And we've discussed this very issue here elsewhere, pretty much around the same topic if using slightly different language. It feels more like a criticism of immersion, maybe a co-opting of it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452784/#Comment_452784" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T17:11:52+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  5:11PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think anytime you compare peoples' preferred table style to a childhood activity (whether it is magic tea party, princess play, or even cowboys and indians) it is hard not to read that as a criticism, or at the very least as the style not being taken as seriously as others.

Sandbox is simply the label for it at this point and that is unlikely to change. The kinds of labels Euro is suggesting are ones I only seen from sites immersionists would generally consider hostile to their play style.

If I can say certain descriptors or key certain elements of my character without having to say "I'm using my Such and Such Aspect, which gives me a +2 bonus" then I think that's largely effective and doesn't break immersion. <br/><br/>For example, a game that I'm working on called Perseverant is essentially "you can do anything you want, so long as you describe it, and use the keywords located on your trait card." As the player is describing their action, they verbally have to say (in the sort "character" of narration, as opposed to "in character dialogue") the specific key word / trait on their card, and physically push that card forward as part of their hand/play for the turn. <br/><br/>This is sort of like the LARP you're referencing David - if you don't have the "thing" you can't say or do the thing, and the system / players just sort of ignore your attempts at the thing. I think this can be adjudicated by a GM/group of course, but creating systems around it might help mitigate some of the power-trip/social-dynamics potential (which I can see as a problem, especially among non-close friends).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452799/#Comment_452799" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T19:38:48+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  7:38PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe use a wheel or clock like PbtA games, but have each tick on clock face be a type of action.

This would be easy to read and tell what everyone what they could do in the situation can do based on the situation. It also could inform what actions could be taken to swing the situation around to what you want. 3 and 9 would be neutral, 12 hostile, and 6 friends. <br/><br/>As much as I love to use voices for my characters, not every player is like that. <br/><br/>Maybe just focus on rules that would allow me to make a character I would love to play.

For me, what pulls me into the immersive experience is being able to try anything like I am there as the character. I don't want to think about how I can't do X, but can do Y. Obviously though you need mechanics. But ideally the system supports the players saying what they want to do and the GM having a way of figuring out whether that works.

I hope it doesn't bother you too much to witness others talk about aspects of roleplaying that you appreciate, even when they are not politically reliable and might have wrong opinions.<br/><br/>I cannot speak for others, but I personally am earnest about trying to help, and do not have a hidden agenda when I discuss immersion in the Internet. The fact that it is not a creative priority for me, and I'm not even sure if the concept is well-founded, does not mean that I am secretly trying to undermine anything. I think that the rough roadmap I posted earlier for how to design specifically for player immersion is solid; I could even see myself try to make an immersive game one of these days, it's not like I'm some sort of a machine programmed to only ever enjoy the same things over and over again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452808/#Comment_452808" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T21:52:17+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  9:52PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I have a vested interest in the content of this thread - I'd like to steer away from the immersion-as-worth-defining-and-secretly-undermining subcontext, if everyone doesn't mind.

I'd love to hear from some others on what specific <i>tactics, mechanisms, systems, etc</i> can use to encourage this type of experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452813/#Comment_452813" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-30T12:47:49+00:00" title="April 30, 2016 12:47PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys are actually doing good work here, and I'm sorry that my getting a bit excited about a tangent suggestion got things wildly off track.<br/><br/>Yes, let's get back to discussing frameworks for supporting immersionist fun. <br/><br/>Eero and I can easily go be nerds about Princess Play in another thread if we want.<br/><br/>One of the big tensions I see is about handling of mechanics on the player end, crossed with how many and what sort of mechanics are necessary for a player to be able to formulate at least a basic idea of their character's capabilities, in order to make informed choices about what their character may attempt in the fiction ( and their likely chances of success)?<br/><br/>I tend to agree with folks who say that mechanics which "fade into the background" either help immersion, or at least are the least likely sort to directly interfere with immersion.

This is where I believe a lot of the differences of opinion arise from. For most people I speak to and play with who value immersion in character, it isn't about the performance. I mean people might be delighted if someone takes to the table like Alan Rickman, but the point really is more about seeing things through your characters eyes. So you could really just play yourself if you wanted to and still be immersed. To compare it to a board game, it is like becoming the piece on the board. Ideally what occurs is through that act you start to see things from your character's point of view....but it should be natural, not something that the mechanics do for you if that makes sense. You want the mechanics to not get in the way, but you don't really want them to push you toward immersion deliberately either. It is more about knowing where the system needs to slacken in order to enhance immersion. At least that is how I normally encounter it. <br/><br/>Obviously sometimes you have to have mechanics for things that can't fade into the background, for whatever reason. So like all things, there will be trade-offs.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452816/#Comment_452816" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-30T13:47:25+00:00" title="April 30, 2016  1:47PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, for the record, I'm not using Princess Play=Immersions.

Asking players "What do you do?" as simple as it is, goes a long way toward encouraging people to think in the firsts person. Having NPCs address them directly works. If players do things like say "I use my Persuade skill", the GM can reply "Okay, what do you say to Persuade him". Asking for more on the ground details from the players can gently encourage them to interact with the setting from the character's point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452851/#Comment_452851" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-02T14:38:10+00:00" title="May  2, 2016  2:38PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense Brendan - and something I think a lot of GMs instinctively do. It would be good to create some kind of cadence or expectation (not dissimilar from PbtA I think) in which the GM would have certain questions that they ask, and certain trigger responses or phrases to help guide their "best practices." <br/><br/>Omnifray was talking earlier about a social mechanic in which the roll was done prior to any in-characterization (even intent) and then that roll "flavored" the GM's side of the equation. Perhaps we could even take a step further, and have a special NPC reaction list:<br/><br/>- The GM would roll for the character(s) general Influence / Esteem / Reputation, and compare that metric to the NPC in question. <br/>- There might be specific bands of reaction ranging from Hostile to Close Friend which modify these reactions / answers / questions<br/>- A good roll or good in-characterization from the player might bump this scale up a notch or two, something which is done only on the GM side so as not to pull the character away from immersion<br/><br/>What do we think of something like that?

(I'm assuming the former).<br/><br/>I've had lots of experiences personally and anecdotally from friends that said something along the lines of "Ooh can I do this?!" and the GM says "No." And sometimes that's perfectly fine and fitting for a particular game, or a setting or a system, but being at least <i>able</i> to say "yes" as opposed to "uhhh, I don't know how to do that in the system" would be a step in the right direction. Would you agree with that chaiboy?</blockquote>\nClock: Basically, yeah. Others have made a good point. In games I've been playing in a game recently where the GM has been letting people try anything they came up with and just had them roll and figure it out on the fly. That might be a better system than a clock but system should be able to handle it since the poor GM had situations that were crazy and making it up on the go can fail in some cases.<br/><br/>As for rules maybe the GM making all the rolls would stop the players from worrying about numbers etc.<br/><br/>Now as for the character I want to play I am thinking in terms of Numenera or Fate/FAE, even hero system and gurps on the crunchy end. You define a character by traits/ aspects/ Nouns and verbs. They make it easy to make a character and get it to work. <br/><br/>D&amp;D3.5 / pathfinder require lots of hoops to make the character I would want to play. To get enough feats and class abilities to emulate the type of character I want is always one of the bigger headaches for me. So I am just saying make it easy for people to make a character work. Even Dungeon world is really good this way. I could make a fighter that uses a whip or just a 2x4 and they would both do the same amount of damage. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452862/#Comment_452862" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-02T17:39:00+00:00" title="May  2, 2016  5:39PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does anyone else feel that principled GM Fiat is a really useful tool for support of immersion?</blockquote>\nYes!<br/><br/>Until it isn't, that is.

If a GM thought a subsystem was fun at that moment, or if they weren't sure how to rule or what on-the-fly decision to make, they could always fall back on them. But they weren't rules in the sense that a board game has <b>rules.</b><br/><br/>To some degree, this attitude/approach was backed up by the myriad of Dragon ( and other gaming) magazine articles that would come out, offering different mechanics that could be plugged in and used over existing mechanics in the rule books. It was also backed up by the way modules would often have a small, specific set of rules for some encounter or aspect of the scenario the designer thought was important in that specific situation.<br/><br/>So that attitude stayed with me ( and other gamer friends) even with other games, and even as we quickly drifted away from dungeon-bashing and more into<i> play for the sake of play, play for the fun of just playing your characters</i> approaches to gaming.<br/><br/>As players, we didn't really need to know the rules, and often didn't really want to know them. We just relied on the GM's knowledge and skill and good judgement.<br/><br/>You can't get much further along the lines of mechanics fading into the background than that!<br/><br/>So that's where I was coming from with that comment about GM Fiat.<br/><br/>And (mostly) it worked, which is what got me thinking about this thread topic.<br/><br/>For me this boils down to:<br/><br/>What's the most minimal we can get mechanically, while still hitting the following stuff?<br/><br/>Enough stuff for players to dig into, to help visualize their characters and get started exploring them<br/><br/>Behaviors of the GM to help the players envision the environment/setting that characters are in, to help feed back into the players enjoying playing their characters and immerse in both character and setting<br/><br/>Enough info/mechanics/methods for GMs to fall back on when they aren't sure how to make a reasonable ruling consistent with the setting/genre expectations, but lite enough to mostly keep in their heads to prevent breakdown of immersion as they go searching for that info<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452888/#Comment_452888" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T15:41:47+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  3:41PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2016 3:44PM by Potemkin.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>For me this boils down to:<br/><br/>What's the most minimal we can get mechanically, while still hitting the following stuff?<br/><br/>Enough stuff for players to dig into, to help visualize their characters and get started exploring them<br/><br/>Behaviors of the GM to help the players envision the environment/setting that characters are in, to help feed back into the players enjoying playing their characters and immerse in both character and setting<br/><br/>Enough info/mechanics/methods for GMs to fall back on when they aren't sure how to make a reasonable ruling consistent with the setting/genre expectations, but lite enough to mostly keep in their heads to prevent breakdown of immersion as they go searching for that info<br/></blockquote>\nI've been following this thread with interest.

Whether the GMs did or not s also open to question.<br/><br/>I know I've been on both sides of the screen in those sorts of groups. I did have fun in them too, and also some horrible crap times that were immensely frustrating.<br/><br/>Which seems a bit paradoxical to me. If the rules are mostly not that important in play, why are they there? They clearly have some importance in getting into the character and setting, but they don't seem all that important in play.<br/><br/>In  play, GM techniques seem to be vastly more important. More important than anything else, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452957/#Comment_452957" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T20:24:56+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  8:24PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm finally catching up to this thread - and it's a good one!<br/><br/>I also have my own take on the "paradox" you're describing: how is it that some people looking for immersion will play basically freeform, while others like to do so in a rules-heavy, simulation-based structure?<br/><br/>I think immersion has to do largely with <i><b>familiarity</b></i> and <i><b>trust</b></i>.<br/><br/>Sure, some things could be said to be inherently opposed to your sense of "immersion", like having to interrupt play on a regular basis. But beyond that, each player and each group seems to have different criteria for what benefits immersion and what doesn't - and sometimes these differences are subtle, but at other times they are glaring (like the rules-light/rules-heavy "paradox" mentioned above).<br/><br/>I think that "immersion" in this context is a voluntary behaviour: what in other media is referred to as "willing suspension of disbelief". You are willing yourself to buy into an illusion and (however momentarily) accept something fictional as "real" enough that it makes you forget about reality - where you are, what you are doing, and so on.<br/><br/>However, to be willing to do such a crazy thing, you must have a high level of trust in what you are doing, and who you are doing it with. You must also have some level of familiarity with how the things works, so you aren't constantly engaging in mental gymnastics just to figure what you're supposed to be doing just now.<br/><br/>This explains the rules-heavy/rules-light dichotomy pretty well, in my opinion. Rules which are internalized and familiar seem to 'get out of the way', because they no longer require a great deal of mental energy to engage. We see this with, say, D&amp;D players feeling distracted by Beliefs in Burning Wheel but completely fine with alignments. Or, similarly, being unwilling to engage with rules or mechanics for managing a group of employees, but having no hesitation about complex tracking of encumbrance or bizarre rules for combat situations (like abstract hit points, as a perfect example).<br/><br/>The familiar can be brushed aside and relied on as a tool. Combine this with trust in the tool (and the people using it), and you're free to "immerse" as much as you want.<br/><br/>Objectivity in the form of rules can help create trust - a sense of impartiality or realism - which can contribute to immersion, as well. Consider how much easier it is for you to "lose yourself" in a novel written by a well-liked author you've been admiring for a long time than it would be if your aunt handed you a text and said it was a book she wrote. You're working from a foundation of <i>being willing to take the fictional as real</i>, and this has a lot to do with your trust in the people involved behind crafting the fiction in the first place.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, young children have a much lower bar for this level of trust, and can "immerse" fully in experiences like, "Hey, let's pretend we're rabbits on the grass." "Ok!"<br/><br/>So, from this perspective, I would look for tools which help to create familiary and trust. If you've had bad experiences with freeform roleplay, you probably won't be able to immerse in that medium as easily - but adding a bunch of rules, however arcane, once familiar enough not to require constant thought, could increase your trust in the process enough to allow you to immerse yourself.<br/><br/>Here's a technique I've been thinking about lately:<br/><br/>Flowcharts.<br/><br/>Creating flowcharts or sequence tables for GM use could be very handy for navigating certain types of roleplaying interactions. The player is not aware that the GM is doing this, necessarily, but in a situation where the GM feels like they would benefit from some procedural assistance, she places a token on a flowchart and then moves it in response to player actions, until the situation is resolved.<br/><br/>This could help bring in things like improved social skills (for characters) or NPC dispositions without having to think about it constantly, and bring forward some of the helpful aspects of mechanized interactions without making it too overt. <br/><br/>A PC is negotiating with a noble about something they want, and behind the screen, the GM places a token on a flowchart. Since the PC is supposed to be very charismatic, the GM starts the token on the left-hand side. As the conversation progresses, when the GM feels that a crossroads has been reached and the conversation needs to move forward, she looks down at the flowchart and moves further through the decision tree. Eventually, the token ends up at an ending point and we can move on. <br/><br/>Essentially, I think the best purpose of GM-side mechanics is, much like for the player, to allow the GM to focus on the current state of the game - like playing an NPC - without having to worry too much about the next step. When some form of procedure helps handle the next step, the GM is freer to focus entirely on the current action and engage with it 100%. I think this kind of thing could be very useful, if it was easy enough to use, and it could help both the GM and the players increase their level of trust in the processes of play (if it worked well, of course).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452959/#Comment_452959" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T21:30:24+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  9:30PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, you took the words right out of my mouth, and spent more time on making it a coherent and thoughtful argument.

On the other hand, some NPCs are just amazingly talented social mongers.

It really took a while to figure out. I find a lot of people I talk with who value immersion, but certainly not all, have similar issues with these mechanics. That said social mechanics in games are so ubiquitous at this point, my approach has become more about learning to work around them (though in an ideal world, I wouldn't use them at all. <br/><br/>I find social mechanics that function like knowledge skills don't bother me so much. It is when social mechanics supplant or interfere with the RP at the table that I get tripped up. So a social roll that undermines a specific line of questioning the player was doing where it is just obvious that he or she should have gotten somewhere, but the social skill mechanic leads to a completely different result. <br/><br/>My rule of thumb now, is to leave the social skill rolls for moments when the GM is uncertain of how an NPC would react. Any roll made against a PC is to just help inform them of the experience. So it is kind of a way of creating an extra data point. <br/><br/>When social skill rules become their own mini-games that don't feel connected to what is going on in game (or where connecting them is incredibly difficult), I can't even use them these days.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452991/#Comment_452991" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-05T15:44:51+00:00" title="May  5, 2016  3:44PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, you put me onto an interesting thought Brendan, regarding your data points idea.

I have Empathy Skill in my game and will occasionally use it by asking the player a key question about how they are presenting themselves. It isn't mind reading though. I wouldn't ask what they are feeling, but ask them if their character is showing any emotions (and maybe ask how visible they might be). A player might volunteer more information however (Yes, my character is really nervous and it is showing). This is something I really don't do much. I try to keep that sort of thing to a minimum (for example it might come up if an NPC has 3 ranks in Empathy and is always sizing people up for tells). More often than not, the tells are in the RP so there is no need for such a roll (in those instances, the Empathy skill is more likely to serve as information for me as the GM running the character----I know he is good at picking up tells).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453001/#Comment_453001" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-05T18:16:08+00:00" title="May  5, 2016  6:16PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that for immersive players who like to <i>experience themselves in a story</i>, social mechanics which do not affect <i>outcomes</i> but rather generate <i>description and affect</i> are the way to go. For instance, if a character is really charismatic and trustworthy, then the GM makes a point of revealing a secret or personal feeling to them whenever they spend time with an NPC alone. Another character might have the effect of calming people around them; yet another might include a note for the GM to increase the aggressiveness of people they encounter. <br/><br/>Reaction rolls (with modifications for "charisma" or approach) in D&amp;D are one way to do this, for example.<br/><br/>For immersive players who like to <i>experience a character as an 'other'</i>, soft incentives would be a good way to go. A mechanical example is how Monsterhearts Strings create experience rewards for doing certain things. I could see the GM holding out an XP coin while making requests from the player in-character, for example - the player can refuse, but they also know that if they go along, they will collect the coin. A more tangible, but less mechanical type of rule might be for the GM to pile up tokens at the table to represent an NPC's sway or presence, in front of the player: the idea is to serve as a visual reminder, without interrupting play itself. This could be enough on its own, or it could tie into some other aspect of the game (like becoming a bonus if a fight breaks out, and you're using a combat system).<br/><br/>Ideally, I think most mechanics (if in use) should be turned into ritual phrases or fade into the background in some other way, so that play can continue unimpeded even as they continue to influence it in subtle fashion.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453002/#Comment_453002" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-05T18:20:21+00:00" title="May  5, 2016  6:20PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points and great ideas from both of you! I think I largely agree - I'm just worried that it keeps coming back to player-reliance or GM fiat. I had a longtime friend who was painfully shy at roleplaying, but liked to play characters who were leaders or good orators (escapism, anyone?) and it was hard for him to articulate what he wanted in character. I just think there's a middle ground somewhere on the social mechanics side that allows for character-as-ego and character skill trumps player skill in social circumstances (long tread ground, I know). <br/><br/>But, I'll noodle it some more. Definitely agree about fade in the background, description/affect, ritual phrases to minimize immersion-interruption.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453025/#Comment_453025" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T13:18:33+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  1:18PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in this thread (and a couple of others), we have been skirting around the idea that some things may deserve another look, including some concepts that have been pooh-poohed for a  while.

That's drifting close to improv theater, almost. I'm talking about a game that a group of strangers can pick up and reliably create a positive experience for everyone. <br/><br/>GM fiat is one of those things that makes for an inconsistent experience, almost universally in the twenty+ years I've been playing RPGs. As has been said upthread (I think Paul put it nicely) that it is about consistency, objectivity, trust. You can have those things with close friends or a very well respected referee, but you need some kind of rules so the players know what they can and can't do.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453027/#Comment_453027" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T15:31:12+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  3:31PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, in this thread (and a couple of others), we have been skirting around the idea that some things may deserve another look, including some concepts that have been pooh-poohed for a  while.

For me, and most other folks I know who talk about immersion, knowing what can and can't be done in advance almost defeats the purpose. That doesn't mean no rules, but rules are just tools to help the GM manage what happens when players try to do stuff. I don't want to think of the in game action and interactions in terms of what the rules allow, but in terms of what I want to try to do next. You can have mechanics that codify actions to a degree, but if you are not giving the GM the ability to sidestep them in order to favor something that feels more logical at that moment, I think you'll end up having trouble with immersion.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453029/#Comment_453029" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T15:55:03+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  3:55PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2016 3:55PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other underused things that might help promote immersion at the table:<br/><br/>* Hand signals instead of props (pointing, throwing a certain set of numbers or gestures to activate parts of the system)<br/>* Getting rid of most character traits and just explicitly playing "yourself, except ___________".

But, 1930s street level super heroes? Sure, they can punch through a wall. <br/><br/>To stay better locked in character, I would want to know going into it what is possible in the context of the system and the setting. I would have a very different type of headspace for the two games mentioned above, although they could use the exact same system. And if that distinction wasn't made clear beforehand - you get the problems where someone shows up thinking they can punch through walls (or a less extreme example) and the GM says "uh no."<br/><br/>Some, not all, players would get sucked out of immersion and dissatisfied by the experience. Obviously this could be avoided with a conversation beforehand and setting expectations. I'm just saying that it helps to constrain things a bit to keep things more in line with human expectation and experience - if the goal is immersion it is hard to immerse yourself as an allpowerful godly being that can do whatever he or she wants (that's sort of what Author stance is all about, again, sort of).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453032/#Comment_453032" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T16:00:16+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  4:00PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD and Bob, those are good points about images!

I've seen a game, for example, where your character's past is not in your hands: if you want to know something about your character's past, you have to ask the GM. Most RPG groups, however, tend to leave this to the player: they know implicitly that you can make things up about your character in conversation ("Oh, sure, my father was a fisherman, and we grew up on the side of a small river...").<br/><br/>That's an example of "knowing what you can do and what you can't do", and jumping into an unfamiliar paradigm could be severely immersion-inhibiting, just like social mechanics or not knowing what's possible in the fiction ("can I punch through this wall?").<br/><br/>When the GM is the person who is resolving all such questions via fiat, it means that unfamiliarity can come in the form <i>of the GM herself</i>. You're in a difficult situation, and things are uncertain: how will the GM resolve this? Even given ostensibly the same "rules", if the game is based heavily in "freeform roleplay" or "GM fiat", the personality of the GM and her imagination can serve as an unfamiliar presence, and throw players out of the immersive spirit. This is where more objective rules can help for some groups - remember that it's not just trust ("I don't know what this GM is going to do, so I can't make decisions in-character!") but also familiarity ("I have to wonder/ask how this will be handled, which forces me to think out-of-character").<br/><br/>Perhaps that's one of the reasons a lot of immersionist groups prefer to have the same GM all the time and play long-term campaigns? <br/><br/>That would allow the group to build up trust and familiarity simply by dedicating a lot of time to playing in a consistent fashion and learning all those subtleties of play enough to "just play my character".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453035/#Comment_453035" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T16:20:55+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  4:20PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "GM fiat" is an interesting topic in the context of the "indie community", because earlier Forgite designs tended to play with GM authority and develop objective rules for who says what and when, as well as how disputes are handled. <br/><br/>When Vincent Baker published <i>Apocalypse World</i>, some people felt that this was taking a step backwards: we have to rely on GM fiat again now, after making all these advancements in terms of how our games operate?<br/><br/>I saw a lot of people feeling surprised that they enjoyed Apocalypse World, given how heavily it does rely on GM fiat (although slightly less so than a typical "Rule Zero-driven trad game", much more heavily than the typical Forge game from the mid-2000's).<br/><br/>Vincent did a good enough job of communicating (and implying, or subcommunicating!) expectations about the GM's judgement through the rules and the text, it seems, for lots of people to pick up the game and play it reliably. The Agenda, Principles, and Moves framework builds strong expectations for both the GM and the players - for instance, we know to expect something bad and irrevocable to happen on a miss (even though the GM retains the freedom of doing something else, even something positive) - and the text itself, through its tone and its examples, communicates even more in terms of play expectations.<br/><br/>Still, even in AW, players and groups have to adjust and develop their own expectations over time about how certain things will be handled, and there's lots of room for different ways to play, in comparison to some other "indie darling" games. In my experience, it takes people a session or two to get on the same page enough to start playing freely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453037/#Comment_453037" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T16:55:46+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  4:55PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GM fiat is never bad; just like voting isn't bad, just like being the PTA bake sale coordinator isn't bad.

This is, of course, somewhat academic as long as we're designing better games and not better people.<br/><br/>What <i>Apocalypse World</i> does is not GM fiat, it's just a system with somewhat more GM freedom than some other games. "Fiat" in the technical sense is, just like in political science, a direct exercise of unenumerated power. A law created by the ordinary legislative process, according to the constitution, is not fiat; a king deciding upon a law with nobody being certain whether he has this authority, but nobody daring to naysay him because he is the one with the power, <i>is</i> fiat. The concept hinges upon whether there is a consensually known and agreed-upon system in place, or if the system reduces to "do what the king tells you".<br/><br/>The Apocalypse World system would be fiat-based if it suggested that the GM in fact has the authority to do whatever he wants and however he wants, and here's some suggestions for what you might do. However, I think that the game text is very clear in that it is offers a constitutional basis for the exercise of GM power; all those GM principles and GM moves are constitutional constraints and specific authorities and freedoms. Technically speaking the GM of AW should be able to base each of his actions upon the constitution, and if he cannot, his action is illegitimate. (For example, making a hard move without setting it up first would be illegitimate, I seem to remember; somebody who knows the system better would know off the top of their head.) I can imagine somebody disagreeing with me on that point, but provided that you feel the same way (that it is possible to make illegitimate moves as a AW GM), then clearly you agree with me in that there is no fiat there, merely a detailed constitution that provides the GM with many options as to how to perform his duties. If it was fiat, the GM could do no wrong, because his actions would be self-justifying.<br/><br/>(The only reason that I have an opinion on this is that the AW GM happens to be very similar to the one in the <i>Solar System</i>, and regarding that game I have very clear theoretical positions on all sorts of things. I've actually never played Apocalypse World, so I guess it's possible that I've merely completely misunderstood it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453052/#Comment_453052" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-07T04:51:17+00:00" title="May  7, 2016  4:51AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2016 4:51AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Apocalypse World's Principles are just GM advice with snappier paragraph headings. </blockquote>\nI agree with this, although with a caveat.

I like Eero's framing of it as a "constitution".<br/><br/>It's subtle (and one could argue that it's entirely insufficient), but there are lots of subtleties in the way the game is presented that builds expectations and then at least *implies* that the players (including the GM) should be following them.<br/><br/>What kinds of subtle things? <br/><br/>Consider the MC move "inflict harm as established". Sure, we all know that the GM can say something happens and say you're injured. However, AW not only suggests that this shouldn't happen without soft moves being made first (like Eero says, I could see an argument to the contrary, but certainly it seems to be the way that the game is received by most people, which is saying something), but then <i>it also</i> packs quite a lot into the next two words: "as established".<br/><br/>There's a lot of implication in such phrases peppered throughout the text - about communication among the group, establishing fiction, and following logical cause and effect based on agreed-upon fictional circumstances.<br/><br/>(Again, I'm totally open to someone saying it's not enough or that it's not that strong - I do agree that, in principle, it's "just GM advice with snappier headings" - but I think there IS a subtle difference there, and if you like at the culture of play around AW, and common attitudes around the game, that seems to be an arguable position as well: it does and it has made a difference for people playing the game.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453054/#Comment_453054" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-07T14:05:01+00:00" title="May  7, 2016  2:05PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so what I'm getting is:<br/>Rules lite, immersions supportive is, in a Big Way, about Building a Better GM.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking there's a corollary or two:<br/>Make it easier to be a Better GM<br/><br/>Make it easier to learn to be a Better GM<br/><br/>( all above in the context of supporting immersionsist fun, naturally.)<br/><br/>I'm good with that.

Just think of a regular interaction you might have in the real world, there really isn't any procedure you are following, it is messy. In an immersion heavy game, the GM is trying to bring that exact kind of feel to life at the table, so if you start imposing procedures on things like conversation, non-combat actions, that can pull you out of immersion because you are not as focused on what you are doing in the setting and have to think about the 'steps'. Some procedures may exist in the game as a necessary evil (for example initiative procedure rules are pretty standard because they help eliminate a lot of confusion in combat....but they do come at a cost). The whole point of rules light is to not add additional things when they are not necessary. The whole point of immersion is to experience things from your character's POV. Unnecessary procedures would not be rules light and would also potentially pull you out of POV. <br/><br/>Honestly the best way to achieve rules light immersion mechanics is to take a much lighter approach to the rules, one where the GM has the ability to circumvent the rules in the interest of things like plausibility and believable outcomes (but also in the interest of covering ground the rules simply don't). I think if you are looking to make better, more immersive GMs, it really comes down to giving them better advice, better tools and more examples of edge cases. Also, perhaps most importantly, a very clear run down of what preparation is involved (this is where you can introduce more procedures). I think from the player's point of view, the core experience of it is that sense that you can at least attempt anything that is plausible within the setting (and knowing what the assumptions of the setting are are the sort of the thing that will get addressed before play begins). <br/><br/>The core advice is this:<br/><br/>Player: Play your character<br/>GM: Play the world <br/><br/>Any rules system that is applied to that is in service to it and adjustable when it falls short (and adjusting rules is the purview of the GM). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453064/#Comment_453064" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-08T18:14:45+00:00" title="May  8, 2016  6:14PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD,<br/><br/>I'm certainly willing to consider the argument that other RPGs have presented GM advice just as well, and we've just been overlooking it because of an ingrained habit not to read or apply those sections.

But I do think these are important core principles if you are shooting for immersion, and they would be a good starting point. However I am wary of building up a list of procedures because immersion isn't about characterization or character sim. It is about just feeling like you are there as the character. At its heart it is letting go. Procedures are fine. Advice is fine. But I feel like folks here are in a rush to build up some kind of working vocabulary and system around immersion, but it is kind of missing much of the point. And there is no point in making a rules light, immersion heavy game, if it is built on missteps like that. <br/><br/>You can't force immersion. If your aim is to build a game that guarantees immersion, particularly to fledgling groups, it is probably doomed to failure. You have to allow people to experiment, to try things, to see what works and doesn't work in their own experience. You can give them tools, but anything that makes sure immersion happens will probably have the opposite result in the long term. I love immersion, but the more I hear people talking about it as some kind of required outcome, the more horrible it sounds to me. i like immersion because my very first experience with gaming was immersion. That was the thing that stood out in my mind and made the experience cool. But nothing the GM did made that happen. He just didn't do anything to interfere with it. <br/><br/>Really you want to make a system and set of guidelines that don't interfere with immersion. That is a very different thing. <br/><br/>For instance the Apocalypse World quote, while that might be sound advice for what that game is setting out to do, I'd be reluctant to issue that kind of advice myself. Immersion isn't insanity. It isn't actually going crazy and thinking you are the character. I am not familiar with apocalypse world so I may be misunderstanding the intent of the sentence, but I regularly speak directly to my players and I don't address Jim as Lord Black Hawk at all times (my NPCs address him as such, but I don't pretend we are not sitting at a table in the present when I address them to ask for things like dice rolls). I'm not going to say it is bad advice, but frankly if I had a GM who refused to call me Brendan and always called me by my character's name instead, I'd start getting a bit irritated. Again, perhaps I am misunderstanding the intention of the advice without knowing the full context. <br/><br/>Also, immersion doesn't have to be mandatory. When you run an immersion heavy game, you encourage people to get immersed, but it is fine if someone isn't. I am not particularly worried if every has the 'right' experience at the table. I just want to make sure people have a good time and that those who like to immerse can do so. <br/><br/>With things like initiative, i really don't think that is due to the war game roots. I think that has stuck around because it is effective. I do agree it is nice when you can do more theater of the mind combat where the flow is natural and you are not listing off initiative numbers, but I've also found freeform initiative can be very hit or miss depending on the group. Generally I use initiative now just to keep things organized. I just think it is worth the trade off and in the end it isn't particularly harmful to immersion if you keep things moving. <br/><br/>You can certainly make a game without an initiative system and that will work for the right crowd. I don't think it is a shortcoming to employ initiative though. <br/><br/>In terms of my experience, yes, I've been playing since 86, so I have had time to find what works for me and figure out how to run games. But I don't think it has been about internalizing procedures. And I'd also only describe myself as an average GM. Really I think it is about just going with the natural ebb and flow of things, and keeping my eye focused on my goals as a GM. There is also just the natural skill you develop at running a game regularly over the course of time. You can try to analyze that and hand it to a new GM, but like anything that is gained through experience, they ultimately need to start with relatively simple instructions and develop the muscle memory over time through practice and use. And there is always the risk that you try to analyze the process, get it completely wrong or miss the point, and then give people advice that looks good on paper but doesn't work in practice (with gaming this is particularly common I think). <br/><br/>I am generally wary when folks try to break down what they think is going on at the table. A lot of times, it seems like people are seeing what they want to see, and just overthinking it in general. Not saying don't do advice or procedures. I am just question the foundations being built here. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453072/#Comment_453072" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-08T20:42:03+00:00" title="May  8, 2016  8:42PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting! Thanks for the in-depth answer. I like the attention you draw to relaxing and settling into a natural flow, and letting the game take its own roots, by focusing more on "not interfering" than on building some specific. Otherwise, we'll probably have to agree to disagree. While presentation is key here - and could easily by mismanaged, as you point out - I don't think it ever hurts to understand what we are doing better, and, more importantly, to share tools and methods with other gamers instead of taking them for granted.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, not that it matters, but you are, indeed, reading a little too much into that tidbit from Apocalypse World. It's basically just saying that it's better if you say, "The monster is running around the corner, straight at you, Wulf. What do you do?", instead of saying, "Bill, the monster is running around the corner, headed for Wulf. What do you want your character to do now?" That sounds fairly helpful to me.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453073/#Comment_453073" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-08T21:09:06+00:00" title="May  8, 2016  9:09PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> While presentation is key here - and could easily by mismanaged, as you point out - I don't think it ever hurts to understand what we are doing better, and, more importantly, to share tools and methods with other gamers instead of taking them for granted.<br/></blockquote>\nAbsolutely I think communicating what you think works is important. I am just cautious and would say people should seriously ask themselves if they truly understand what they are doing. What I mean by that is, when you analyze and break down any process, and I see this all the time in RPG discussions, it is so easy to misunderstand or oversimplify (or just plain get it wrong). Particularly if you re going to analyze and then form that act like you've acquired scientific conclusions on the subject. My preference is to take a very light approach there, emphasizing that 'this stuff worked for me, use it if it works, but don't chain yourself to it'. And with rules light, every effort really needs to be made to stay simple. I used to make rules light games, and I actually stopped because I found I wanted more robust mechanics. With rules light, everything you add in, particularly anything that adds process or steps, potentially destroys both the rules light aspect and the immersion aspect (because it is just one more thing to keep in mind when you are running a game). <br/><br/>In boxing and other martial arts there is a saying that when the bell rings, you forget half of what you know. And a lot of boxers get into trouble when they try too hard to recall the training and advice, and don't move naturally in the ring. I think the same applies to GMing. When the game starts you forget half your prep and half the rules/guidelines. If you overwhelm a fledgling GM with stuff that they have to keep in mind (particularly if you are trying to break down complex social interactions into discrete components) they will have that much harder of a time developing the natural reflexes they need to function live at the table. <br/><br/>That is why I was trying to start with really simple core principles. Because I've found by going back to something really basic like that, you can kind of lift yourself up when you run into problems during a game by remembering them. Anything else beyond that takes time to hone and figure out. <br/><br/>The more natural, the more comfortable people are, the better. I think if we try too hard to protect GMs and players from bad games or from games that don't become immersive, then really you just make everyone tense, because it is like the world collapses if the game isn't good or immersion fails to take hold. I started getting better at GMing when I stopped worrying about that stuff. I figured: it is going to suck sometimes. Just like comedians sometimes bomb, GMs sometimes have sessions that bomb. And I think the lessons you acquire from those experiences are very personal and subjective, they are hard to create universal principles or guidelines out of. You kind of have to experience the bad sessions to know how to avoid them and how to right the ship when they happen.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453074/#Comment_453074" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-08T21:14:44+00:00" title="May  8, 2016  9:14PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true!

Just a body of techniques useful for immersionists support, divorced from any specific system?

It certainly isn't what I have in mind. I am not talking about identifying with your character. I am talking about the sense that you are there as the character. That you are present in the game and seeing things through your character's eyes. These are different things. And while I am sure there are a few people who would find having authorial power enhances that experience, I have rarely met such people, and for me it completely disrupts the experience if is apparent. I am not saying authorial power is bad. I have no issue with it, but I do think it isn't generally conducive to immersion. For me and for most others I've met that talk about immersion, having the ability to step outside your character and gain control of the 'narrative' just takes away from the "i am there" experience. Any 'authoring' I do, I want to be through my character.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game/p5">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20626%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20626%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Designing for a rules-lite, Immersionist supporting game? - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Designing for a rules-lite, Immersionist supporting game? - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20626/designing-for-a-rules-lite-immersionist-supporting-game/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="(Yes, he was talking about seeing things through his character's eyes too.

But I do know the people I encounter who feel authorial power enhances immersion are the extreme minority of players I meet, while a significant number of people I meet say their immersion is really hampered by the mechanics than hand authorial power to the players. You could certainly make a game that is tailored to your own experience. But I do think any honest attempt to put together a game specifically made for immersionists, is going to have some difficulty if it includes the one things immersionists say again and again they do not like. You could certainly do it. I can just pretty much guarantee it will come up as an issue for people. I think if you are going to do it though you at least want to tie the authorial power mechanic to the setting (i.e. the PCs all have some kind of reality shaping psychic power). If it isn't, then for a lot of us, it is going to feel like stepping outside of the character, focusing on the overall story, not on what we are doing in that moment.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453117/#Comment_453117" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T20:15:46+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  8:15PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After lengthy debates at the Forge, the general consensus was that "immersion" is too tricky to define and too personal to discuss with a broad brush.

I think as most people seem to understand immersion, his stated preferences is a bit someone who regards the HERO system as a rules light engine. If it feels light to them, that is fine, but any rules light game that uses that as its standard is going to run into issues with most ruleslight players. By the same token any immersion driven game that uses authorial mechanics, is going to meet tremendous resistance from many immersionist players. I am not saying you can't do it. But you'd probably want some heavy caveats and optional tags around that stuff. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453127/#Comment_453127" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T21:29:35+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  9:29PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know; I've heard that kind of thing (or similar opinions) fairly often. I think it really depends on the game culture you're involved in and what kinds of features are ruining your immersion.<br/><br/>For some players, having to ask questions about obvious things leads to their immersion suffering. For instance, I'm imagining myself sitting at the bar, with a beer in front of me, and I want to describe myself splashing the beer into my date's face. I'm in the moment and we've been having this intense conversation and I'm pissed. It's all very vivid in my mind. However, if I'm playing in a style where I have to ask the GM first, so I say, "Do I have a beer in front of me?" The GM responds, "Oh, um, you did, but actually you just finished it." So now I have to order another one if I want to do that... my mental of the whole conversation which just went down might need to be reconsidered and retconned.<br/><br/>For some players, that's a very unpleasant and "unimmersive" process; it jars them out of the fiction they were imagining. In a game with some authorial permissions, however, that player can just say, "I splash my beer in his face! Like this! And I storm out the door at the back..." That can feel much more intuitive and natural.<br/><br/>I think so much depends not just on personal preferences but also how the group generates the shared imaginary space.

In practical terms this means accepting that the player's reasonable assumptions are true, thus freeing play from an entire cycle of mother-may-I back-and-forth.<br/><br/>Then again, describing this in terms of narrative authority is to my mind somewhat besides the point. It's not much of a narrative authority for the player to be allowed to imagine a scene and act upon their imagination without having the GM get all fascist on the placement of furniture in the scene. What horse does he have in the race, anyway - should be pretty obvious to just let it go when it comes to the small stuff. It's not like we're talking about a slippery slope where soon the players will be imagining ninja squads into existence because you allowed them to assume the existence of a bar stool in a bar without double-checking with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453142/#Comment_453142" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T12:11:52+00:00" title="May 10, 2016 12:11PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So ...is that a technique worth noting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453152/#Comment_453152" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T14:59:09+00:00" title="May 10, 2016  2:59PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say so.

It makes sense to have the GM control your character's past in a game where such decisions are considered tactical detail ("If we let them decide for themselves, all of their siblings will be CEOs of multinational corporations or other important NPCs"), so it's not insane for that purpose, even if it's got nothing to do with psychological immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453155/#Comment_453155" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T16:40:22+00:00" title="May 10, 2016  4:40PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2016 5:14PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>For some players, that's a very unpleasant and "unimmersive" process; it jars them out of the fiction they were imagining.

That can feel much more intuitive and natural.<br/></blockquote>\n(Not much time today, so quick reply on iPhone):<br/><br/>Sure but this is kind of a fuzzy area. Really you are talking about where the group draws the line on assumptions so people don't have to pop out of their character to ask too many questions. Where that line is will vary a lot from group to group but it isn't strong authorial control you are describing. 'I throw my beer' is something many groups will allow without much thought. Largely because it is a reasonable assumption that you have a beer (though a lot of groups would expect you to state that you buy the beer first). But that is a world away from "As I drink my beer, the king's soldiers storm in and demand to know where the Rink of Qarba is". The first one isn't really an attempt by the player to play the world (the player is just making an assumption and wants to maintain flow). The second is a clear attempt to play the world and control the plot. It is much more authorial and I believe the vast majority of immersion uses would find it disruptive. If, when you and JD say you need authorial control to maintain imnersion, you mean the former, I think that isn't something people would object to hugely (though they'd want some caveats and such). If you also want to to include the latter, then a lot of immersionists would take issue. <br/><br/>And I do think it is important to note that when most RPG players talk about immersion they are definitely talking about something a bit different than being engrossed in a novel or movie. I'm sure some do mean it in a similar way, and they can talk of being immersed as they help author a story. But the term just hasn't come to mean that in the hobby. The way it is used, it has strong connection to being immersed in your character. For a lot of people that is going to be very hard to achieve if they are also authoring the story.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453156/#Comment_453156" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T17:15:26+00:00" title="May 10, 2016  5:15PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The guy I talked to specifically wanted control over significant aspects of the situation, not just details (though now that I think about it, all his examples were details, though he had a WHOLE LOT of them because he was trying to inhabit a fully fleshed out sensory world.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453157/#Comment_453157" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T17:17:43+00:00" title="May 10, 2016  5:17PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2016 5:20PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The guy I talked to specifically wanted control over significant aspects of the situation, not just details (though now that I think about it, all his examples were details, though he had a WHOLE LOT of them because he was trying to inhabit a fully fleshed out sensory world.)</blockquote>\nI am sure he did. But I also think he is a big exception if that is the case. By all means, feel free to release a Rules Light/Immersion book or advice column/thread that recommends these things. Just know there are large numbers of people out there that will pause at that and consider it one of the key things most likely to break immersion. Also see my previous point about the distinction between assumptions and flow, and authorial control.

And a word isn't going to mean the same thing to everyone. That is why in individual cases it can be incredibly useful to ask questions like "You say you like immersion; what do you mean by that?". My dad for example will say he values safety when deciding which car to buy. But if you ask him what he means by safe, he'll say he wants a car with a lot of horse power and pep because it helps him get out of the way of danger. I'm sure there is a sound argument to be made for being able to quickly accelerate making merging safer. But I don't think a car company that advertised its vehicle as safe, soley because it can can go from 0-60 in three seconds, would be taken all that seriously (and I suspect many will would see it as suggesting the opposite of safety). <br/><br/>When it comes to immersion, sure some people will want to be able to say "I have a beer in my hand" and not have flow disrupted because that will pop them out of character. I've said, that can be reasonable, and if that is the extent of what authorial control means, you won't have many issues. I've certainly met people who value immersion and want basic and obvious assumptions to not be contradicted without good reason. It isn't a universal preference among immersionists, but you encounter it, and this is an issue most groups negotiate in some way at the table. What I don't see are people who value immersion and say they want to be given real narrative control, where they are able to decide what monsters are present, what the villain does, etc. Most don't want to play the world. I think that is a fair and not terribly controversial observation about it. And again, if people want such an authorial tool; more power to them.

I am also not suggesting we call someone a cheater if they assume their father is a great warrior (personally that wouldn't bother me if it is a reasonable assumption, though I might correct the person if it contradicts something in the setting----like everybody already knows the man he identified as his father was a feeble scholar poet who never raised a sword in his life). But this is relatively minor edge case. <br/><br/>If people want more consistent authorial control, once again, I said that is fine. I don't object to people playing games however they want. Nor do I object to game rules being written toward such preferences. All I am saying is, if we are talking about immersion and how to manage a table of people who value it, if you start layering in narrative mechanics, it stands a big chance of being a controversial choice. <br/><br/>If the question your raising here is this: I have a group of people who all say they value immersion, and some of them say strong authorial control enhances their immersion; what do I do? My answer is you do whatever you need to make that group function and have a good time. You don't kick people out. you don't get into fist fights over the meaning of immersion. But if there is a huge clash being created by their desire for authorial control, and other players desire for it not to be present, a decision is going to have to be made one way or the other, or toward a compromise. My point is, this is a potentially contentious set of preferences in an immersionist group. So you have to deal with that stuff cautiously. Just like if you are running a rules light game, you have to be a bit cautious about things like introducing things that make character creation more complex or optional rules that make combat take longer. My point is not that they are evil and need to be abandoned forever by the hobby.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453164/#Comment_453164" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T19:10:23+00:00" title="May 10, 2016  7:10PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess what I'm trying to get at is that the term "immersion" doesn't seem to have any real practical use if the practices required are contradictory.

However, in both cases, a certain level of "in-character powerlessness" was helpful; in games were I can use creative narration to invent circumstances, for instance, I don't feel immersed. This goes hand-in-hand with a very robust fiction, usually quite detailed. There needs to be a sense that fictional obstacles are solid and tangible, and not subject to creative whims - something which can fail in "regular" GMed RPG play, too! But I've had success (personally) achieving both in those two types of GMless(?) contexts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453172/#Comment_453172" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T20:00:10+00:00" title="May 10, 2016  8:00PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2016 8:05PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Brendan, you've made a lot of very intelligent and helpful contributions to this thread.

Especially when people are taking things that really exist in most gaming groups to varying degrees then use them to wedge in broader definitions of 'authorial' and 'narrative'. I think if we define immersion so broadly that all it means is a strong sense of engagement with the content, rather than seeing the world as the character, it almost has no utility. But when defined the way I am using it, it has incredible utility from a play style and design standpoint. <br/><br/>And again, if you want immersion to mean something broader. If you want it to include narrative/authorial mechanics, go ahead. Just note my objection that you are going to get a strong negative reaction from a lot of people who value immersion.<br/><br/>I do think I speak for the bulk of immersionists though.

There used to be a lot of advice about giving good descriptions that include different senses like touch, taste, smell, etc. Used sparingly and when it really matters, I think it can help. But I've also seen way too many GMs go overboard here, struggling to include this stuff when it just doesn't matter. What I find helps is only mentioning something like a smell if it is particularly striking or unusual (or help produce a visual image in the player's head). I also have found brevity in description goes much further than a wall of narration. My descriptions used to be much longer, filled with more adjectives, and covered as much ground as I could. The result was players mostly stopped paying attention a couple of sentences in. Now I keep everything pretty short, to the point, and work to find exactly the right word to describe things (which is a hit or miss thing and takes time to develop).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453192/#Comment_453192" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-11T13:41:27+00:00" title="May 11, 2016  1:41PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you expand on that Brendan?<br/><br/>What did you find was the most effective, happy medium?<br/><br/>If you  were to describe it in one or two catchy sentences for a new GM, what would they be?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453193/#Comment_453193" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-11T13:42:26+00:00" title="May 11, 2016  1:42PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2016 1:48PM by Potemkin.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

But in my case, I've always found brevity more effective, and it is usually most effective if you can find that one word that describes an action or setting but suggests a lot of other elements. Every group is different though, so I kind of tailor it to my players. I usually just try to find the best word I can that will carry as much weight as possible. Basically I'm just trying to reduce my overall wordage so I am quickly conveying things. I wouldn't sweat it too much though. </blockquote>\nSo, this is good stuff.

Maybe "Words that multitask can be useful", "Try to use effective words" or something.

I think the advice is sound if people apply common sense and don't go overboard. Importantly, I you need to speak in your own voice for description. Sometimes I think GMs read things like 'describe key sensory details' as "always include a sense somehow". Whereas I've found in practice factoring in senses every once in a while can help bring them to the surface. But I don't think there is really any wrong here. Being a GM is, I think, a lot like being a comedian, in that you find what works in real time with each group. And what works for one comedian won't necessarily work for another (imagine Louis C.K. doing John Moulane's routine or vice versa).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

First of all, I divided my immersive experiences into "sensory engagement" (experiencing the smells of the dungeon, the chill wind in Nephalia's mists, the sword heavy in hand) and "emotional engagement" (variations on caring about the outcome and other emotional connections to characters).<br/><br/>In my own personal, can't-speak-for-anyone else experience, interfacing with rules, minis, maps etc get in the way of sensory engagement as does long-winded and boring descriptions and listening to box text. I have a very vivid and easily engaged imagination and I can easily find myself in another time and space, which is why RPGs are so fruitful for me.<br/><br/>Well-chosen, well-designed and adhered to rules can greatly increase emotional engagement. Making me care about the outcome of the game helps make mechanics and fiction blend together.<br/><br/>We were playing a board game just now and\u2026 (fictional) people got hurt and it was tough to deal with. I imagined myself taking samples, counting test tubes, starting cultures, negotiating with the board\u2026 trying to save lives at the expense of other lives, weighing the options with a heavy heart.<br/><br/>Anyway, summary:<br/>1. Have rules, it helps with emotional engagement. But few and good, because they hinder sensory engagement.<br/>2. No box text, no long descriptions. Engage the senses, sure, but keep it brief.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453370/#Comment_453370" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-19T05:22:17+00:00" title="May 19, 2016  5:22AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2016 5:22AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a>, I'd like to contribute to this thread, but am totally lost re: what useful ideas have been noted already.  Could you post a list?  I'm sure I could add to it.  Right now, though, I fear I might just be repeating stuff others have said in different words.<br/><br/>More generally, I'll throw in my two cents in agreement with Brendan -- for "immersion" to mean anything different than general engagement with play, we have to narrow it down a bit, and "in-character decision-making" is the core of the most commonly-narrowed definition.  Anything which sullies decision-making with OOC factors is thus highly suspect on the immersion front.  Personally, I do see a limit to this, though.  "All in-character all the time" actually runs substantial risks on the engagement front, and you can't have immersion if everyone's getting bored and tuning out.  A lot of the work I've done on this front has been aimed at addressing "about the game" needs with as little interruption to immersive flow as possible, trying to strike the ideal balance.  <br/><br/>I don't think leaving the fun entirely on the shoulders of the GM is ideal, and I don't think asking the GM to do whatever suits the players' immersion, including at the complete expense of their own, is the best way to go either.  I am not sure what compels most immersionist GMs to be immersionist GMs, and what they get out of it, but thus far my vague sense is that things go better when the GMs get to have their fun too, and when their fun and the players' fun are aligned and concurrent, rather than (as is frequently the case in old-school, sandboxy immersive play) taking turns.  That's certainly been true in all my immersion-focused play, both as player and as GM.<br/><br/>Whatever techniques I have to contribute will likely accord with that sensibility (though I'm sure I'll think of some stuff my friends use too that isn't my bag).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453378/#Comment_453378" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-19T13:45:33+00:00" title="May 19, 2016  1:45PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may be easier to simply make a new thread, listing of immersion supporting techniques.<br/>Anyone who has already suggested techniques in this thread can copy and paste those or re-write them.<br/><br/>My take-away from most conversations I've been in regarding immersionism is that immersionists already have the games they want. Almost any mainstream design will work, provided there is a small set of easily handled, easily understood rules that don't ask players to make decisions outside of character very often. If they do require OOC decisions, they should be in the form of stuff already used in other designs, since those are already mastered to the extent they also tend to fade into the background in actual use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453391/#Comment_453391" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-19T19:31:39+00:00" title="May 19, 2016  7:31PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding taste and perception, I suspect you're right.  Was your thought that this thread should be about designing something for folks who <i>aren't</i> immersionists (yet)?<br/><br/>When I work on immersive designs, I'm usually imagining two audiences:<br/><br/>1) People who aren't into immersion because, as they've previously encountered it, it tends to come with a lot of other stuff they dislike, but would be open to immersion without that other stuff.  (I think a lot of stuff that veteran immersionists have internalized is not <i>objectively</i> immersion-friendly, and can actually be anti-immersive for newcomers.  A lot of trad combat systems, for example.)<br/><br/>2) People who do already get immersion in their play, but deal with some annoyances and frustrations in the process.  I think I can eliminate some of those.  Also, people who already get immersion, but maybe not as regularly, or continuously, or as deeply as they'd like.  "I'm immersed until I have to read the GM's mind" or "I'm immersed until combat starts" or whatever.  Even if such players aren't actively looking for something new, maybe they might still dig it if they saw it?<br/><br/>What's your take?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453395/#Comment_453395" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T11:42:23+00:00" title="May 20, 2016 11:42AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My motivation in this? Hmmm.<br/><br/>The best way I can describe it is this. I've met plenty of people over the years who like RPGs at a kind of very basic level. Like they enjoy the basic activity of Play Pretend as Adults.<br/><br/>Many times, they really are into...just being their character at some level. They may well not know a whole lot of the mechanics that are supposedly involved. It doesn't stop them from having fun at all. Sometimes they play for years, never particularly knowing any of the mechanics. Heck, I've played like that myself, and had a wonderful time.<br/><br/>And sometimes, man, you really are digging the <i>be someone else, think like someone else, imagine yourself n this other world</i> feeling. It's really incredibly fun. That's what I'd identify as immersion fun, right?<br/><br/>And, sometimes, mechanical engagement knocks you right out of it. Boom. That fun is suddenly over. <br/><br/>So, really, I'm just trying to suss out the truly minimal things you need to encourage that feeling, and do it as easily as possible. And find those things that encourage getting into that fun more easily.<br/><br/>I've also come to feel that Back-Hacking is just a stupid habit. And by Back-hacking, I mean trying to take a Big Whackin' System, learn it, then toss out 95% of the mechanics in favor of some kind of GM-monitored/GM-enabled freeplay. Like really, complete and utter waste of time for everyone involved. Worse, the habit, common in the RPG hobby, is a barrier to learning new systems and settings, and kind of a barrier to getting folks to take a hand at GMing.<br/><br/>I'm looking for the basics. The true, important, fundamentals of getting this fun. The techniques that matter regardless of system. I'd like to see how lean and mean we could get with those things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453396/#Comment_453396" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T11:55:22+00:00" title="May 20, 2016 11:55AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've also come to feel that Back-Hacking is just a stupid habit.

I have never, not a single time in my entire life, seen 95% of a system thrown out the window. What I have seen is recognition by the GM that a specific mechanic fails to address a given situation plausibly so he overrules it. I've also seen GMs draw creatively on the system to address the question of what happens. But the core system still gets used in those cases. When I encounter it, it is more about not be a slave to the system. That is different from running something RAW. But both pure 100% RAW all the time, no exceptions, and chucking out 95% of the system in favor of fiat or something are extreme caricatures of two ends of the play spectrum. I've played in games where the system is used consistently, and I've played in games with strong rulings over rules takes hold. The latter was particularly well suited to immersion in my experience as a player. It is important to realize though that a GM who is using the rulings over rules to play the world as honestly as possible, is a very different thing from a GM who is altering rules in order to get the adventure he wants or the outcomes he wants.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453398/#Comment_453398" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T12:28:11+00:00" title="May 20, 2016 12:28PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, let's approach it from another direction.<br/><br/>Here's the imaginary situation.<br/><br/>You're with a group of friends.

On top of that, you want just the right amount of rules that are easy to interiorize and streamlined enough to not interrupt immersion.<br/><br/>Hmm, sounds tricky but perhaps it's doable.

How about some resource management, like HP, mana, ammunition, spells per day, charges of a class skill, stamina? Would you be okey using at least a single one, maybe in the form of tokens instead of writing and erasing numbers on a character sheet? Would you prefer to only keep record of your character background, motivations, bonds and flaws on your character sheet?

"Be an engaging GM", in pretty much any flavor, likely covers it.  Playing pretend <i>is</i> fun!<br/><br/>I think the situation only gets complex when the players start forming goals for what they want to <i>do</i> in the fiction.  At that point, we start needing some sort of system (rules, rulings, randomness, whatever) to arbitrate how that goes.  What we need depends on what the players want to do.<br/><br/>So in the example of getting inspired by a film, I think we have a genuine challenge there, to suss out what it is about the film that's driving each individual player, and what they want to do with that drive, and what sort of support and constraint and opposition they want or need.  <br/><br/>The simplest scenario, I'd say, is the one in which the players don't have any ambitions of putting their characters through the movie protagonists' paces, and are content to simply wander around a cool setting.  That's pretty close to just requiring "be an engaging GM".  <br/><br/>But if they each want to feel like they're Indiana Jones, doing Indy stuff and getting Indy results, now that's what I'd consider a serious GMing challenge.  I mean, the GM asking themself, "What would happen in Lost Ark?" can cover all the bases where the gaming and the source fiction align, but Lost Ark isn't an adventuring party with multiple leads, so with a typical play group the parallels are going to break down.<br/><br/>Even more problematic, I'd say, is the scenario in which players hear or think the word "game" and form an expectation of skill-based struggle against opposition.  Either we need a <i>ton</i> of system (even if it's all just informal GM principles), or we need to nip that impulse in the bud ASAP, probably by calling it something other than a game.<br/><br/>If "the version where you just need to be an engaging GM" is all you're after, then I'd be happy to unpack what I've done on that front that's worked.  Most of it boils down to "focus on the fiction" and "yes, and".  I have never met a freeform player who had any problem with High GM Judgment so long as such judgment never shat on their fun.  Don't shit on the players' fun and you're golden.  Say a lot of "yes", and if you ever need to say "no", make sure you make it really clear where the fun is in that.<br/><br/>Minor note: until it becomes a pattern, the old "yes, but it doesn't matter" outcome that many veterans hate (prompting some to move from task res to conflict res) is often <i>totally fine</i> to new players!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453408/#Comment_453408" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T16:15:00+00:00" title="May 20, 2016  4:15PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2016 4:29PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed with Brendan that "rulings over rules to play the world as honestly as possible" is fun and viable (from all sorts of ostensible system starting points, I'd add), and that "uses the rules, but isn't a slave to them" is common.  <br/><br/>I've also seen what K-Bob describes, though, where someone gets stuck struggling with rules they don't want to use, or does throw out 95% of them.  I played a con game of Artesia: Adventures in the Known World where the detailed character sheets we were given were 100% irrelevant as the GM walked us through his planned plot.  His plot was pretty cool and he was an engaging speaker, so we had a pretty fun time, but the Artesia system was <i>absolutely</i> thrown out.  <br/><br/>And as for the struggle with rules griefing freeform, I've seen that a <i>ton</i>.  However large the number of groups out there who get to the optimal point where they're using the rules when and only when those rules are productive for that group, I would bet that at least as many groups are currently in the <i>process</i> of getting there, at a midpoint that isn't always fun.  It took my groups something like a decade to figure out that we could get stoked by Rifts setting material without being obligated to use every Rifts rule.  Granted, we were something like 12 at the beginning of that decade, but I think accessibility to kids and teens is highly relevant to K-Bob's endeavor here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453410/#Comment_453410" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T16:36:42+00:00" title="May 20, 2016  4:36PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random thought: rather than asking what an enthusiastic newcomer to "let's just play pretend!" might like or dislike about any given traditional system, it might be more enlightening to ask what they might like or dislike about Fiasco.

While I have never honestly seen someone throw out 95% of a system, if you are doing that on a regular basis, then you are clearly playing the wrong game. I suppose if you've cobbled together a home-brew and now have  functioning system, it is fine. But I can't imagine having to work around a system 95% of the time. For me rulings over rules means managing edge cases that crop up from time to time, or being able to go beyond the rules when they don't cover something enough (i.e. the player does something really unexpected like improvise a ritual appeal to the gods, which the rules just don't happen to cover even though the setting material makes clear the gods are real and occasional respond to things like major sacrifices). For most immersionists, the biggest complaint I see isn't that the system fails to encourage immersion, but that it somehow actively impedes or discourages it. So generally people who like immersion will pick the system they have to ignore or fight against the least. A situation where 95% of the rules have to be chucked, ignored, altered on the fly to maintain immersion is a sign the system isn't compatible with your immersion (now if they are being chucked for other reasons, still bad, but might have nothing to do with immersion). I am not sure what happened in the Artesia game, but that sounds like something that might annoy me if the GM just ignored the system entirely. Now there is such as thing as going beyond the character sheet. So maybe it had more to do with that.  For example not everyone wants the system to catalog all aspects of characters mechanically. That is what the whole debate about skills in D&amp;D was about. For some folks, they want some basic mechanics on the sheet but they want the GM to be able to go beyond that with things like "given your background as a son of a castle lord, you know that this man would expect to be addressed by his formal title with you averting your gaze"). But that is a different story from ignoring rules.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453412/#Comment_453412" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-20T17:57:04+00:00" title="May 20, 2016  5:57PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2016 6:49PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that for every group that has a coherent strategy for pursuing immersion, including which games to pick and which rules to obey, there are many more who haven't yet reached equilibrium on that front.

Either we need a <i>ton</i> of system (even if it's all just informal GM principles), or we need to nip that impulse in the bud ASAP, probably by calling it something other than a game.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think that would help also.\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/If">@If</a> "the version where you just need to be an engaging GM" is all you're after, then I'd be happy to unpack what I've done on that front that's worked.  Most of it boils down to "focus on the fiction" and "yes, and".  I have never met a freeform player who had any problem with High GM Judgment so long as such judgment never shat on their fun.  Don't shit on the players' fun and you're golden.  Say a lot of "yes", and if you ever need to say "no", make sure you make it really clear where the fun is in that.<br/><br/>Minor note: until it becomes a pattern, the old "yes, but it doesn't matter" outcome that many veterans hate (prompting some to move from task res to conflict res) is often <i>totally fine</i> to new players!</blockquote>\nAgain, just as a basis to really get the ball rolling, go for it.

It'll probably be unnecessarily skewed toward things I personally have done.  Maybe we can weed those out and move toward more universal generalities later.<br/><br/>The first things that come to mind are more about functional facilitation, rather than engaging narration.<br/><br/>1) <b>Maintain clear division of labor.</b>  You are the GM; they are exclusively playing their characters.  Make the roles clear before play begins.<br/>- reframe attempted GMing as character searching -- if someone says, "I find a fire hose to spray them with!", instead of saying, "No you don't!  There's no fire hose here!", you should instead say, "So you <i>look</i> for a fire hose..." and continue GMing<br/><br/>2) <b>Maintain character sovereignty.</b>  Don't ever tell anyone what their character thinks or does.  Don't let anyone else tell anyone what their character thinks or does.  Make this policy explicit.  Refer back to it aloud as needed to rule out fictional elements like mind control.<br/><br/>3) <b>Facilitate player character unity.</b>  I don't mean that all the PCs must <i>agree</i>, but they <i>do</i> need to all be in the same place dealing with the same situation.  (Cutting back and forth between different characters in different stories is possible, I guess, but I sure wouldn't screw with noobs' immersion by making them jump back and forth between in-character and audience.)  No matter how well you interact with each player, the game will still get clunky if the players have no interest in interacting with each other.  The easiest solution is to create characters that are all:<br/>a) up to the same endeavor<br/>b) close friends, relatives, or otherwise greatly invested in each other's welfare<br/><br/>4) <b>Make sure no one gets skipped.</b>  One player may perform an action that prompts you to respond, and they may respond with another action.  Wait!  Fictional time is passing here!  And if other players want to act during that time, but can't because they couldn't get a word in edgewise, that's terrible for immersion.  To avoid that, you have to:<br/>- pause the roll of any player who's monopolizing the action<br/>- check in on everyone you haven't heard from since the last fictional development<br/><br/>5) <b>Help turn others' thoughts into words.</b>  Some players find it easier to imagine than to share.  This is fine, but a bare minimum level of sharing is still necessary for group fun.  If you check in on a silent player and ask what their character is doing, and they say "just watching" or "waiting to see what happens", you do <i>not</i> need to drag an action out of them.  However, if they say "nothing" or "oh, don't worry about it" or they just shrug, you should try to help guide them to at least the point where they say "waiting to see what happens".  There are two ways I do this:<br/>a) suggestive prompts -- "Are you cautiously assessing the situation?  Are you bewildered?" -- followed by a validating reaction ("Gotcha!  Cool.  We'll see what you determine shortly!") when they eventually say "yes"<br/>b) asking "What do the other characters see?" and then prompting as needed ("Do you look scared?  Tensed for action?  Total inscrutable poker face?  Are you stock still, or moving in some way?") and responding as in (a)<br/><br/>6) <b>Treat the fiction like it's real.</b>  Unless you're taking a break, talk about fictional people and places and things as if they're real, and fictional events as things that actually happened or are happening.  Convince yourself of this reality, and others will pick up on it.<br/>- if anyone else tries to use the fiction as a toy to overtly play with, such as narrating nonsensical character actions for the sake of humor, advise them against it, e.g., "that was funny, but if we do that again, no one will be able to envision this imaginary stuff as being real, so let's not; let's keep the jokes and the roleplaying separate"<br/>- note: players joking to each other about the game <i>without</i> warping the fiction is usually fine; don't police that unless you can see it ruining your or another player's ability to immerse<br/><br/>\xa0<br/>I think maybe that's enough to play together?  Probably worth noting that these responsibilities could be shared by the entire group, not just the GM.  Might be good to go over them together before play begins, actually.  So, finally, on to engaging GMing:<br/><br/>7) <b>Be a good tour guide.</b>  The players are visiting your world!  Show them the highlights, and check to see if they have questions, and answer their questions.<br/><br/>8) <b>Only steer until someone else wants to.</b>  New players might be content to let you do all the steering, in which case you can feel free to unfold your world and plot in whatever way you think will be most striking.  However, you <i>cannot</i> ever <i>insist</i> that things go that way.  If the players want to explore a different direction, then you must embrace that.  For me, this combo means:<br/>- don't prep or get overly attached to a vision<br/>- be ready to improv and talk a lot<br/>- feel free to follow your inspirations<br/><br/>9) <b>Fun trumps Likely.</b>  Don't be a probability simulator unless you really enjoy it.  Do what you're enthusiastic about.  If you get inspired to introduce some extremely unlikely outcome or event, don't censor yourself.  Roleplaying is a conversation, and an enthusiastic conversationalist elevates the whole conversation.<br/><br/>10) <b>Say yes.</b>  When players are trying to immerse, the <i>last</i> thing you want them to worry about is <i>how to succeed</i>.  Your "yes" doesn't have to always give the characters their hearts' desires; it just has to sustain the players' sense of agency.<br/>- if you can't see how a PC action could work, ask!  "Do you think that could work?  How?"  Sometimes players will happily admit that a thing should fail, and in <i>that</i> case, you <i>don't</i> have to say Yes!<br/>- "yes, but now you have this other thing to deal with!" is totally fine<br/>- "yes, but the basic problem remains" is often fine as long as you don't overdo it<br/>- if you think a PC action was particularly clever or cool, run with that appreciation -- don't censor yourself from rewarding it "too much"<br/>- if your sense of the fiction truly dictates that you <i>must</i> say No, make sure that's fun, so the players don't learn to fear it (my go-to response: "That doesn't work, but it does produce [entertaining color] and in the process you notice [another way forward]").  If you get really good at this and your group embraces it, you can eventually move away from "say yes" if it serves some other purpose to do so.<br/><br/>11) <b>Always allow reaction time.</b>  If you want to give the players a new problem, or shut the door on an extant opportunity, go ahead, but announce the change before it's too late for them to do anything about it.  "The door begins to close" is better than "the door closes".<br/>- sometimes the players will embrace the change instead of resisting.  When they do resist, "yes, but the basic problem remains" is often your best response: "You've stopped the door from closing just yet, but the mechanism is grinding and the wall is trembling and before too long the whole thing may collapse into a pile of rubble!  You've bought yourself some time, but not a ton.  What do you do with it?"<br/><br/>12) <b>Ask, "What do you do?"</b>  If you give the players something to respond to, usually they'll just respond, but if they're ever unclear that this is their time to do that, prompt them.<br/><br/>13) <b>Be tonally consistent.</b>  If you run out of ideas, whatever jumps to mind next is probably fine, but just make sure you aren't ruining the established tone.  Better to take a break than do that.<br/><br/>14) <b>Break before you burn out.</b>  A pause to recharge is always wiser than addled GMing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453448/#Comment_453448" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-21T18:35:32+00:00" title="May 21, 2016  6:35PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More game design ideas:<br/><br/>Eliminate all dice and props from the game.

I use lots of things there myself but haven't ever described so much of it indetail - the usual problem you get when you internalize these things too much. I've got a fet things to add there too: <br/><br/>4) -I usually add another variant: to interrupt the player and give the spotlight to another (specially a more passive player) I narrate how the action of the previous player affects another player, like "ok, you just avoided the minotaur charge, but before you react, X player has a chance at shooting it from afar / now has to jump to avoid the charge too!" (or whatever fits the fiction).<br/><br/>Of course, this works better in a system without explicit turns like the one we're discussing here.<br/><br/>6) -I prefer to warn players <i>before</i> the game, but when in game I sometimes threat to take the player joke input by narrating it's effect in the fiction -which IMHO has a much better effect than preaching to him or being somewhat patronizing. Whenever I do, the player usually takes it back inmediatly, goes defensive and takes the game seriously faster, correcting their input. <br/><br/>On other cases (usually after one or more threats or just when I find it interesting) I simply take the player input and built over it turning into something serious and interesting. For most players it's like finding out they have the power to make their thoughts come true but realizing they have no control over which part of it becomes true unless they focus and think what they say. Like, when a player says "wouldn't be funny of the Minotaur showed up now?" And while I laugh I start narrating "And then, the minotaur shows up!" like if the player had just read my thoughts, and we go from there. The effect is always great, I bring this kind of player input into the game anytime the occassion appears, which is quite often.<br/><br/>8) About this one, I'd reccomend prepping in a different way over going full impro. Not that full impro can't do the work, but prepping small things in advance helps impro a lot. What I do is prep bits of somewhat disconnected info: monsters, items, traps, places, characters, lore, detail, gather inspiring music and images. It all can be linked by theme or related to one or more PC backgrounds, but it isn't a must. I rework the material a bit until they are interesting, maybe I just steal things from a book, a movie, etc. Then I follow the players lead and whenever they ask a question I pull one of these things from my notes and place it where it's needed, or just go impro if I don't have anything that fits. At least you will avoid running out of ideas and burning out more often.<br/><br/>10) Another interesting choice there can be a "It must have worked, but against all odds, it doesn't and Y happens instead" meant like a way to introduce a mistery. Of course, it's only valid if it isn't something crucial in the middle of a tense situation, after all, the idea here is to introduce something to push things foward. Like, "you all walk into the mist and after a few minutes, for some strange reason, you end up in the same spot"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453536/#Comment_453536" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-24T15:59:15+00:00" title="May 24, 2016  3:59PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>Like, are you okey with rolling a single dice, a pool of them or using any kind of randomizer at all to decide what happens when a situation resolution is unclear enough?

Any other precise requirements?<br/><br/>So far my best shot at this has been:<br/><br/>-Used 2d6, no bonuses. You get a nice bell curve for the probabilities. <br/><br/>- 7 general skills (perception, stealth, intimidation, persuasion, bluff, athletics, knowledge) listed just to let players know what they can try, let them come up with any special skills or specializations of the general skills they want (up to 5 to put a number)<br/><br/>-Assume they have the appropiate equipment to use those skills, maybe limit the uses of a skill per day if it seems too umbalanced.<br/><br/>-Main two rules to make mechanics work are these: 1)no skill is infallible, meaning that you don't get a free success just for using it. You can have a sword that destroys anything but can you swing it in time? tell me what do you do to reduce the chances of missing or roll the dice. 2) whenever the players roll low the GM introduces a threat or applies the consequences of a threat he presented before.<br/>This way you can be as epic as you want and still have a balanced game.<br/><br/>-If you want more GM control, use <i>virtual levels</i>, this means that you can have the PCs level up, but that doesn't mean they get to add bonuses to their skills. Instead, the GM narrates combats with lower level enemies as easier and against higher level enemies as more difficult, lasting more and making them spend more resources/time/etc.<br/><br/>-You can make wonders with a 2d6 to add versatility and represent many things mechanically, like having players roll both dice separately whenever they want to make two attacks, or just having them roll again if they can justify more attacks through the use of any skill give them one re-roll when they have the right ability for the task at hand or have other kind of advantage. You can put a pool of bonus dice on the center of the table that players can give to another player whenever they support them. For the next roll that player can roll the 3 dice and keep the 2 best. But anyway, you may not need any of these fancy tricks at all.<br/><br/>I came up with an even more simple mechanic the other day but haven't tested it yet: use just 1d6 and players get what they want on a 6. However, they can pile up all sort of tactical advantages or resources to reduce the difficulty, even to the point of not having to roll the dice. Like, they are now surrounding the oponent, so everyone can hit on a 5-6. Now they have the cleric's buff too, so they hit at 4-6, etc. Taking risks also may lower the difficulty but then on a roll of 1, you lose whatever you're risking. Then you can also "take fallout" to lower the difficulty, like, getting wounded to get the chance to kill an opponent. I like that it's incredibly simple and still makes tactics, planning and collaboration quite important.<br/><br/>And that's it, you don't need any other mechanics. With some good negotiation techniques you won't even need to get to the dice-rolling part. Please, I'd like to hear your comment on any of this before going over the techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453561/#Comment_453561" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-26T12:23:31+00:00" title="May 26, 2016 12:23PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thoughts are that your suggestions are about the level of complexity that I would throw together for ad hoc gaming in the past. <br/><br/>Yeah, the specifics might differ ( my early gaming was almost defined by  d% roll under systems, so those seem incredibly natural to me), but the essence would always be similar to what you posted.<br/><br/>I'm trying to get at the GM techniques that go along with those sorts of "fade away" mechanics, those that take it up to the level of supporting immersion.<br/><br/>I think, overall, people have some fairly clear ideas about what interferes with immersion fun*, but not as clear what supports it.<br/><br/>* Broadly.

Great, now all you need to do is two or three ways to confront the question "how do I avoid things from happening in the fiction?" without resorting to the dice.<br/><br/>On the GM side the angle of "say yes and build from there" has been successfully tried and tested. You also have different versions of "how exactly you do that?", like Archipielago's "Describe it in a different way" or "tell us more" to signal players that, while you're still not blocking her intent, it still doesn't sound plausible. The key is exactly that word: plausible. If whatever the player says sounds doable, it happens. If it doesn't sound too easy, it happens with a cost for the player, or risks a future danger, or the cost is applied to other character.<br/><br/>So then you get to the part of who decides which is plausible or not, according to which criteria. I'd leave that part to the GM first, because he's the one framing the scene. He's gotta be cristal clear about things, so I'd also let the players use the phrase "tell us more" or "what else I see?" to get more details and clarifications from him when needed.<br/><br/>A friend of mine suggests the use of tags to help negotiating. Like, if you haven't reached an agreement to this point, you list your advantages like one or two word tags counting them with your fingers. For example the player will say "I've got a big<small>1</small> sword <small>2</small> and I'm on high terrain <small>3</small>" and then the GM lists his advantages. Other players can point at other advantages or disadvantages too, but the thing is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this process shoud be really short and not generate a side conversation about the negotiation</span><br/><br/>Still don't have an agreement? ask for a roll and go on. At least moving on quickly will be less immersion-breaking than further discussing it. You will still need a great deal of GM fiat to pull this out though. If you're considering a system that still uses characteristics with numerical bonuses, comparing them could also be used to speed up the negotiation, instead of rolling and adding those.<br/><br/>BTW, besides not getting into the way of immersion, what else do you think a mechanic or technique should do to support immersion?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453589/#Comment_453589" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-27T12:02:46+00:00" title="May 27, 2016 12:02PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>BTW, besides not getting into the way of immersion, what else do you think a mechanic or technique should do to support immersion?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI snipped a bunch, but yeah, that's all good stuff right there IMO!<br/><br/>Things I <i>think</i> support immersion (and I'll leave whether they do or not to other people...)<br/><br/><b>Short, but strong initial impressions and choice words that support that.</b><br/>Brendan was hitting on that. It's a matter of getting just enough, but not too much to confuse things or bore the players. Every NPC and scene location should have some choice, short, descriptive hooks to be memorable.<br/><br/>Later description can layer on more subtlety. The thesaurus is more you friend here than the dictionary. Also, it's completely appropriate to choose words that imply a character should feel a certain way, provided they don't demand it. Or demonstrate the quality you want to get across at some point.<br/><br/><b>Make use of non-game time, when players are not in character, with the game on, to get player input and ideas.</b><br/>I suspect that lots of the kinds of player input associated with not terribly immersion supporting games can still be used, provided that input time is entirely removed from in-character play time.<br/><br/><b>Set up non-threatening situations, just to see how characters react.</b><br/><br/><b>Encourage the players to have a short, strong hook/concept for their characters initially, and work to make sure that by the end of session one, every player at the table has a good idea about who the other characters are.<br/></b><br/><br/><b>As GM, have a bunch of general purpose bits about the various character's backgrounds.

About the <b>short but strong initial impression</b>, you can describe things in general by giving the one adjective, two if you want to make it important and three if you want to make it the focus of the scene, you don't need much more than that to start. If players get interested they will ask for more.<br/><br/>For the <b>non-game time input</b>, I once made a deck of cards that out-of-scene players could use to intervene in the scene currentyl being played. Some of the stuff on it was good, some only apply to games with a bit of PvP. For example, one card would let you add any kind of atmospheric noise to the scene, which was good to catch everyone out of guard but it was still up to the GM to turn it into something real or important. <br/><br/>Other cards would let you take control of a minor NPC in the scene, some with an specific task in mind, like getting killed in a horrible way, commanding other minions, deliver a message to anyone in the scene, mock someone, etc. You could have cards to let people change the weather or introduce minor elements to the scene that could give an advantage to anyone using them, etc. It was great to keep everyone focused on the scene as players were glad to intervene in some way and make things more difficult or just different for the players whose characters were on the scene.<br/><br/>This also made easier for characters to have scenes of their own and separate the party in a way that wouldn't ruin the fun for any player that wasn't present on the scene, There was actually no rule about when you could draw cards nor how to use them except for whatever was written in the cards, so players could pull them at any time and discard them if they weren't inspired by whatever they got. They would even pull more than once in the scene and keeping their input in control wasn't too hard. Just by seeing a player reach for the card the GM could decide to let her do it or interrupt her with a gesture to signal that he didn't wanted the scene to be interrupted, no further blocking was needed.<br/><br/>The rest of the cards wouldn't probably interest you too much, some gave an automatic sucess that the player could assign to either a PC or NPC; it could be quite good for unexpected twists, like if you kinda liked how a particular kobold was doing against the party you could help it survive, maybe even become recurrent, or you could help a fellow player overcome a challenge you don't consider that much interesting, or maybe just stay in the fight a bit longer. But perhaps this card could be too much an create some immersion breaking, specially in a game where you already have good negotiation techniques, I'd say it works better in a game where dice rolls count.<br/><br/>Oh, one important thing about player and GM input: it should always be narrated from a character's point of view. Nobody can say what another character is thinking or feeling, except when players refer to their own character, and even then they should limit to what their characters show about themselves, whenever you communicate things you could only know if you were omniscient you are breaking immersion for others.<br/><br/>For the part about<b> encouraging players to have an strong concept and comunicate it</b>, there's this trick I still want to try: at character creation, have each player make up one thing their PCs admire or respect about one other PC. It could be an anecdote, it could be related with their best skill, something they heard them say, etc. You could also say they get to explain the reason whe they think that character should be in the party. At least this would help you get a better idea of what the rest of the PCs expect of you or what kind of image you have been projecting to them before the adventure starts, so you can either try and change it or "live up to those expectations".<br/><br/>Besides <b>visual art</b>, well I use ambiental music but for you it would certainly do better to find out ambiental noises, <a href="http://www.ambient-mixer.com/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> has a nice library and it seems you may register to make your own, though the library has probably all you need.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453600/#Comment_453600" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-28T01:06:25+00:00" title="May 28, 2016  1:06AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wouldn't it be better to require players to say what their characters have <i>claimed</i> they admire (for example) about others, rather than what they secretly, inwardly might admire?

I think the basic idea of fleshing out some in-character impressions and experiences between the PCs before play is fantastic, but I prefer a slightly different way to go about it.  I've gotten good mileage out of fleshing out looks, tics, habits, and then doing some "before now, y'all experienced X; how did you react?" snapshot stuff.  Often as one player is revealing things about their character in this process, another player will chime in with their character's reaction.  "My guy thinks it's cute that your guy is afraid of heights, but finds your distrust troubling," etc.<br/><br/>Hmm, now that I think about it, I completely omitted "getting the fiction started" from my list of tips.  There are certainly some key practices in there, like not starting with too big a gap between player and character knowledge.<br/><br/>15) <b>Align player and character knowledge before starting.</b>  Wandering around a world that your character knows well but is alien to you can get disorienting!  Same with your first interaction with people who your character has known for years!  Cover what's led the PCs to the point where play begins, until the players are comfortable diving in fully in-character.  Depending on the game, this can include broad setting culture and metaphysics, why we're here on this quest right this minute, and/or anything in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453614/#Comment_453614" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-28T21:36:00+00:00" title="May 28, 2016  9:36PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Wouldn't it be better to require players to say what their characters have <i>claimed</i> they admire (for example) about others, rather than what they secretly, inwardly might admire?

"You can just ignore this... but would that feel right?"  Have one NPC treat another NPC unfairly and <i>some</i> PC will usually have an opinion.  Or, heck, injustice aside, just have two NPCs of different types disagree!  See which types (the drunk, the elite, the kid, the sage, the poor, the rich, the naive, the world-weary, etc.) which PCs will tend to love or hate.<br/><br/>Another option: give the PCs an audience.  Have people take an enthusiastic and credulous interest in who they are and what they've done.  See how much the PCs are inclined to brag or preach etc.<br/><br/>Other non-threatening situations I've gotten great mileage out of: resources to spend, favor to redeem, beauty or luxury to savor, slog or hardship to weather, unfamiliar food to eat.\n<blockquote><b>Constantly look for visual art to share with the players that helps set up the scenery and feel of your setting.</b></blockquote>I often image-hunt for work.

That's the whole "mechanics that fade away are a Good Thing" idea.<br/><br/>(Conflicting with that though is the issue that immersionsists need some sort of basic measures to start building up their character concept and have some idea of what happens when things interact. <i>My character is very strong, but what exactly does that mean in game context?

Without them, things grind down to No Fun.<br/><br/>On the other other hand, there seems to be a willingness to dump off, well,<b> tons</b> of work on GMs. Even f players don't really see it, they still want it to be there.

No rules, no problem.  If we're used to establishing the fiction on the fly, then there's no reason to be upset about a moment of that.  On the other hand, you could certainly wind up playing with hyper-sensitive players who are scarred by previous bad games or GMs or whatever, in which case the GM must either be a complete slave to the most thorough prep ever, or simply demand that the group get over their baggage and show some trust.  You can guess which approach I prefer.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Beyond that, though, I will say that I think, "Hey, players, <i>watch me</i> invent the world as needed!" is not the most immersion-safe style of GMing.  Some players really enjoy a real-seeming, solid-seeming environment to inhabit in-character.  Accordingly, I <b>do all my ad lib world-inventing invisibly</b>.  My players are even down with some misdirection, where I pretend to look up a fact or roll on a table while I'm making shit up.  More often, though, when the characters enter a new space, I start describing it, and I don't rush myself, and during that process I decide what's there (whether the PCs know it or not).  This is super easy for me in two circumstances:<br/>1) I know the setting incredibly well and have a "common sense" for what should be where.<br/>2) No one knows the setting well and it's not bounded by realism and I can do whatever I want.<br/><br/>The hard circumstance is when I'm held to standards on things I'm ignorant about, like if we're playing in China, and I don't know shit about China, and keep describing environments and NPC behaviors inappropriately.  (I've given up on that.  I don't do authority-style, immersion-abetting GMing for that kind of thing anymore; I need all the players to be telling me about China, in a generally non-immersive way, in order to run a game set there.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453640/#Comment_453640" name="Item_199" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-30T14:55:00+00:00" title="May 30, 2016  2:55PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But you can actually do that in an immersive way, you know?

(rolls some tables and look up his notes, but is actually inventing something on the run)... and as the fog above the mountain clears a bit you do see the tower... though now it looks not just rebuilt, but brand-new, tall and magnificent.<br/>PC: wtf?<br/><br/>I admit that this works for my group due to our mindframe for playing; they are aware that I do prep but that I'm totally okey to follow them wherever they want to go. I'm totally used at hitting back at them whatever they throw at me, for good or bad. And it works exactly as David wrote: I won't announce which part I'm winging and which not, at least not in the middle of the session, that would totally break immersion. The deal is that they want to experience a story and do things that matter there, so for them it doesn't actually matter how or when things are invented as long as they appear when needed but look like they have always been there. <br/><br/>And with a bit of practice, it doesn't even matter who invents them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453641/#Comment_453641" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-30T17:06:19+00:00" title="May 30, 2016  5:06PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, I'm gonna say something once suggested by the late and great Johan Rising: Good rules for supporting immersion are rules that bring your experiences and decisions as a player in line with those of your character. I have an example, too.<br/><br/>Some time ago, playing Svart av kval, vit av lust, my diceless Vampire game, there was a scene between Dr. Braunschweig, a Frankenstein-like character who was a human but knew how to create vampires, and his creation Karel, a vampire. In the rules, it states bluntly that a human cannot win a conflict against a vampire (unless they're a vampire hunter). It cannot happen. If there's a conflict, the vampire simply wins.<br/><br/>Now, this scene was pretty tense. Karel had gone behind his "master"'s back, and figured out the secret to making new vampires. Dr. Braunschweig was furious, and the scene escalated. Karel got cocky, then threatening. Dr. Braunschweig drew a gun and pointed at his creation. "Not one step closer, or I'll shoot!".<br/><br/>At this moment, Gustav, playing Dr. Braunschweig, knew full well that he couldn't defeat Karel. It was impossible. His gun was completely irrelevant. Nothing he could do in this moment, as a player, could make him defeat Karel. All he could do was try to get out of there alive (and if Karel wanted to catch him, he would).<br/><br/>Afterwards, Gustav told me how the rules had really helped him get into his character, aided immersion. Dr. Braunschweig was terrified, and knew that he didn't stand a chance against Karel. The rules made Gustav feel the same thing. Immersion.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Rising's point about immersion was that rules could do more than just stay out of the way. They can aid immersion, as long as they're made the right way. If your character is thinking about how to outmaneuver your opponent, and you as a player are thinking about the same thing, that will aid immersion, according to his hypothesis. But if the rules are making you think about initiatives, special abilities and hitpoint management, that will take you out of immersion, since those aren't issues your character is facing.<br/><br/>So, according to Rising (I'm unsure, but I think it's an interesting path to explore), make rules that make your IC and OOC perspectives merge. You can do it by making rules that follow the fiction, as in my example above, or by making fiction that follow the rules. I haven't played Freeport, but I get the impression that this game does that, by having the gauges and tokens present in the rules present in the fiction as well.                        </div>\n<div

Dr. Braunschweig drew a gun and pointed at his creation. "Not one step closer, or I'll shoot!" . . . Gustav, playing Dr. Braunschweig, knew full well that he couldn't defeat Karel. It was impossible. His gun was completely irrelevant. Nothing he could do in this moment, as a player, could make him defeat Karel . . . Dr. Braunschweig was terrified, and knew that he didn't stand a chance against Karel. The rules made Gustav feel the same thing.</blockquote>You said that this worked well, and I completely believe you, but in this account, I can't see <i>why</i>.  Maybe Gustav didn't understand the human/vampire mismatch simply from the fiction, and had to refer to a rule to give him information that he didn't have through his character?  Or maybe he did know in-character that the gun was useless... in which case, what did the rule add?  Personally, to feel immersed in that moment, I'd want to know, as Braunschweig, <i>why</i> the gun was useless.  Otherwise, I'd be terrified, but shooting and holding out hope!<br/><br/>I think this sort of thing (my perception, not your actual play) is the reason why designers looking to keep player and character experience close together have historically gravitated toward a "get out of the way" style of rules design.  So I'm very curious about what I'm missing from your account.  Can you explain further?<br/><br/>The result I'd <i>expect</i> would be that your rule mandated that a certain type of experientially-rich dynamic exist in the fiction, and then you and Gustav created that dynamic as directed, and enjoyed playing with it in place.  In which case, I'd say that the rule does add something to immersive play, but I wouldn't say that it operates in play to align player and character experience.  To me it seems more like a rule for how to set up good situations to immerse in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453649/#Comment_453649" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T06:02:49+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  6:02AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You said that this worked well, and I completely believe you, but in this account, I can't see <i>why</i>.

The rule meant that Gustav as a player felt helpless and feared for his character, much like his character felt helpless and feared for his life. The similarity between the emotions of his character and himself helped close the gap between IC and OOC and put the player in the head of the character.<br/><br/>Am I making sense? I'm not sure I have a better way of explaining it. Knowing why the gun was useless would be a logical connection (synchronizing knowledge), but this was an emotional connection (syncronizing emotions).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453655/#Comment_453655" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T12:52:39+00:00" title="May 31, 2016 12:52PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The axe grinding makes me question what people are really interested in. <br/><br/>Personally, I've found D&amp;D works well for immersion.

Interesting!</blockquote>\nYep, you are right about that one! but besides of that, Practice here mostly refers to getting used as a player to do part of the work the GM does. As in, at some point someone on the table will put the GM in trouble by asking him something he hasn't come up with yet. At that moment everyone expects the GM to be creative and keep making the world look real and alive. Well, when the GM does the mountrain trick, he's expecting the player to fill that void while remaining in character. The player herself will of course suffer a bit of disconnexion but at the same time, will be given an opportunity to spout lore in a more believable act than if she were asked some information and THEN the GM narrated how her character explains it.<br/><br/>So, we are speaking of some practice that is actually worth the time. Practice on your mindframe for this way of playing and the disconnection makes less trouble. And, you gain the opportunity to play characters that will help the groups immersion. Like, you will see the mage actually spouting lore instead of looking at the GM spouting it and then try to look smart back at the party and say "Right, I explain that to you"<br/><br/>I mean, we're also looking for ways to decrease the load of work on the GM while still keeping the game quality up, right? Why don't let the players do some of the work as long as it doesn't disrupt their immersion as a group?<br/><br/>Also, whatever reduces system talk to nothing or a minimum would be wonderful, don't you think? I mean, imagine you're all talking in character and whenever you need to resolve conflicts, you pull a card and everyone seeing it knows what it means. You don't need to say a thing about it but just keep playing the consequences instead. You can have ritual gestures to convey other system information, so everyone knows when it's your character making gestures or when it's you as a player making gestures. You can have a whole ouija-like board with icons or phrases to engage the system and pass along the planchette to mark player turns and give the players their chance to engage the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453663/#Comment_453663" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T16:44:07+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  4:44PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Brendan, don't be so negative.

Exploring interesting and unfamiliar places is fantastic for my immersion!  I should have listed that in my "D&amp;D pluses" list.  <br/><br/>Having an interesting world to look out onto is definitely one of the best ways I've seen to get players looking out through their characters' eyes.<br/><br/>Actually, I think my notes about danger are really a subset of that.  Danger is just one of the things that makes a fictional environment highly worthy of interest.<br/><br/>On a tangent: <a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a>, I think the specific version of "interesting and unfamiliar" that a lot of fantasy roleplay tends to use has its immersive hurdles.  I find fantasy more immersive when I know exactly where it's grounded in realism and history and where it isn't, and most of my engineer/history buff/grognard friends seem to work the same way (though it only really matters when you spend time outside the dungeon, so that preference is probably a feature of us doing that a lot).  Not that that's different from any other genre where we can't simply use our real-world common sense -- near-future sci-fi is usually way worse!  Don't get my players started on artificial gravity.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So, maybe that's another tip: if your larger setting is going to matter, and it isn't the real world, use a setting that's very well-defined.  That way, there'll be way less work for the GM to get everyone on the same page during play, and fewer risks of players incorrectly assuming how stuff should work and having their immersion broken when they need to be corrected.  <br/><br/>It's also fine to have the larger setting not matter, though, and keep the whole game in wilderness or dungeons or something.<br/><br/>There are, of course, a million setting books out there looking to define a cool place for you, with some better at informing player common sense than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453679/#Comment_453679" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T17:47:37+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  5:47PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2016 5:48PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The rule meant that Gustav as a player felt helpless and feared for his character, much like his character felt helpless and feared for his life.

I've never designed for bleed, instead focusing on enabling in-character player <i>conscious decisions</i> by aligning player and character <i>knowledge</i>.  But gut reactions are important too, and I've sometimes found it anti-immersive how some other people play their characters as stoic tacticians in every situation, more or less immune to horror or fear etc.  I don't know if Gustav is such a player, but if he is, then I can see how taking the 'stoic tactician" option away from him would be a huge aid to an immersive experience.<br/><br/>For me, bleed has always been emergent, never rules-led.  I'll have to think more about that.<br/><br/>I do think that there's a lot of jarring potential on the "conscious decision" front with a rule like "you lose vs vampire", though.  The moment where I'm in character trying to form a response that'll save my ass from Karel, but then as I'm thinking up options I refer to a game rule, is an anti-immersive moment for me.  On the other hand, if I truly internalize it before play, and don't have to think about the rule in the moment, then I have no problem.<br/><br/>Any thoughts on why this went smoothly with Gustav, and my "out of character knowledge!" concerns weren't an issue?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453680/#Comment_453680" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T17:50:01+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  5:50PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm catching up on "Office Hours" and Adam quipped that he hates the old saying "We spent six hours playing D&amp;D and didn't roll a single die and it was great!".

A location with levers and gadgets to explore and interact with. NPCs to talk to. PCs with drive and relationships and conflicting values to talk amongst each other. The production of all of these aiding factors can be aided by mechanics (tables, dungeon generators).<br/>The dice we bring out for dangerous situations only, because we want to blame the dice rather than anyone around the table if things go south, and we want to praise ourselves rather than anything around the table if things go well <small>[I suddenly became very suspicous of the expression "go south", as I almost typed "go north"]</small>.<br/></blockquote>\nSure, you interacted with a big chunk of the system and totally ignored the rest of the system. Pretty much the entirety of D&amp;D's reward system involves killing monsters, taking their stuff, earning XP, and leveling up. If you don't do any of those things, how much do you really need D&amp;D to do it? You could almost use your knowledge of D&amp;D's setting to sit around making up freeform stories. <br/><br/>The system has done more than "get out of the way" in this case. It's entirely failed to do anything at all (after set-up, as you point out). In general, people playing D&amp;D this way are ignoring huge chunks of rules. That is, the rules aren't getting out of the way; the players are actively ignoring them and shoving them out of the way. <br/><br/>And the same people who will tell you they just want system to "get out of the way" will scream at me about how D&amp;D 4e sucks and D&amp;D 3e is amazing, and I'm thinking, if they just ignored the rules they didn't like, this "we spent six hours playing D&amp;D and didn't roll a single die" style of play would look entirely the same under any version of the game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453681/#Comment_453681" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T18:24:49+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  6:24PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2016 9:03PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, we are speaking of some practice that is actually worth the time. Practice on your mindframe for this way of playing and the disconnection makes less trouble. And, you gain the opportunity to play characters that will help the groups immersion.</blockquote>I do think this is a topic I haven't seen mentioned enough in immersion discussions \u2014 if I'm trying to immerse, that's not just up to me and the GM, but the whole group.  Nothing ruins my immersion more than playing with some other player who doesn't give a shit, or is treating it purely like a boardgame or something.  So, if the player to my left is doing a thing which doesn't help their immersion but <i>does</i> help <i>mine</i>, that's plenty valuable!  I'm skittish with this idea, though, based on how much it might <i>hinder</i> <i>their</i> immersion.  Telling oneself "this is worth it" might help make it good for play, but not necessarily good for immersion.  I'm torn.\n<blockquote>I mean, we're also looking for ways to decrease the load of work on the GM while still keeping the game quality up, right?</blockquote>Not always \u2014 sometimes the GM finds a way to make their responsibilities fun and efficient and easy \u2014 but yeah, I've certainly seen and experienced this aplenty.\n<blockquote>Also, whatever reduces system talk to nothing or a minimum would be wonderful, don't you think?</blockquote>Some players don't seem to mind system talk at all!  Personally, though, I'm with you 100%.  "No system talk" is value added for me.<br/><br/>So is "here's what I remember" as opposed to "here's what you remember" and "yeah, I tell them that" (though I consider this minor).<br/><br/>So, yeah, maybe I'm starting to buy your argument here, that maybe we sacrifice a little bit of one person's immersion, but as long as that isn't too big a hit for them, it's worth it because of a fast-running game with less GM burnout and maybe some moments of smoother conversation with less rules-talk.<br/><br/>I think there are plenty of other ways to achieve less rules-talk with zero dents to any player's immersion, but they all require things of the GM, so if GM burnout is an issue, then maybe "less rules talk" and "distributed GM tasks" are a good match.  I guess it depends.  When I GM for Delve, the need to describe fiction without reference to rules is <i>not</i> one of the things I find burdensome.  But I think I'm at the high end of the "enjoys making stuff up" GM spectrum.\n<blockquote>I mean, imagine you're all talking in character and whenever you need to resolve conflicts, you pull a card and everyone seeing it knows what it means.</blockquote>Sure, that's basically what I do with dice.  I think I actually prefer the simulation quality of a roll for a target number, even if you do have to spend one second speaking in rules-talk ("4 or better!"), as opposed to the pure randomness of a card draw.  But in general I agree with you that streamlining resolution is nice!\n<blockquote>You can have ritual gestures to convey other system information, so everyone knows when it's your character making gestures or when it's you as a player making gestures.</blockquote>Yup, Delve uses gestures to communicate IC/OOC.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Not sure what other system information you might be thinking of conveying this way, though...?\n<blockquote>You can have a whole ouija-like board with icons or phrases to engage the system and pass along the planchette to mark player turns and give the players their chance to engage the system.</blockquote>I think referring to physical props is actually very distracting.  Looking at a die just long enough to see which face comes up, and looking at a character sheet only when I can't remember what's in my guy's backpack, is much more my ideal.<br/><br/>Edit to add:<br/>An additional downside of player input into setting is that it erodes the illusion that the setting is a real, concrete, consistent, continuous place.  Many players find that that illusion aids greatly in their immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453683/#Comment_453683" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T21:56:36+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  9:56PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've been using the Mountain Witch trick consistently for a couple of years, and even newbie players get it right away. I'm always surprised at how eager are players to invent stuff by themselves once they get a few clues about how and get prompted for it. It's totally different that doing it right at the start of the game and ask players to come up with what at that point, would seem to be the whole fun of the game.<br/><br/>As consistently as I've seen it happen, I'd dare say I've never seen it actually break anyone's immersion when used in middle session. I admit, it absolutely doesn't enhance character immersion, but jumping in and out of character stance to author stance only seems to generate another different kind of immersion. After all, you're making up something and seeing people playing with it and building upon it fosters the feeling that you're getting recognition from the group, that your effort is appreciated. You were put on the spotlight but you had the right answer, so now you can go back into character and relax.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453685/#Comment_453685" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T22:59:41+00:00" title="May 31, 2016 10:59PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2016 11:00PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Different kind of immersion" makes sense to me.

I agree with him that using the material in this post to built a design that fits his tastes is not possible now since between us there isn't an obvious common ground about what character immersion means nor a common agreement on how to facilitate it. <br/><br/>I mean, I think we spent the first two or three pages of post just clarifying what kind of immersion we were talking about. And while it's all right that we all have different oppinions, points of view and ways to approach the subject, the fact that they seem somewhat far apart wouldn't give anyone enough confidence to trust that all this could work with different groups than ours.<br/><br/>So, my statement was more in respect of how I think Komradebob wants his immersion to be than about our different personal views in immersion. I do realize that in most games that we've seen and design, system actually generates specific forms of immersion, genre or theme-wise. I mean, hp generates a disconnection between actual wound related realism which is perfect if you're more interested in playing an epic tale instead of a war story with lots of gore. VtM uses humanity as a mechanic to showcase the spiral of corruption and decadence, but you can ditch it to play vampiric superheroes.<br/><br/>So well, since Komradebob didn't actually answered much of my questions about his personal taste in systems, I understood he was looking for something more generic, a consensus about the subject, which as we've seen, still doesn exist. I do hope to see more designs in the future dealing directly with character immersion as once again we have proven that the hobby still remains quite unexplored in many more areas we could think it possibly had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453713/#Comment_453713" name="Item_233" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-01T23:32:18+00:00" title="June  1, 2016 11:32PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I've learned a whole lot from this thread, and I've found some real nuggets of insight in it I think I can use, especially when a friend tells me they very much are into immersionist fun as a primary reason for playing.<br/><br/>Some of them are very subtle things, nuance on things I knew, but with important shadings I hadn't realized in the past.<br/><br/>In terms of <i>design</i>...I don't really have anything new coming out of this. immersionism seems primarily supported by GM behaviors more than anything else, and it really is kind of a case of ( mechanical) system doesn't matter...unless it interferes, from what I can tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453716/#Comment_453716" name="Item_234" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-02T14:45:39+00:00" title="June  2, 2016  2:45PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453717/#Comment_453717" name="Item_235" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-02T16:20:59+00:00" title="June  2, 2016  4:20PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, <a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a>, thanks for that assessment.\n<blockquote>I do realize that in most games that we've seen and design, system actually generates specific forms of immersion, genre or theme-wise.
