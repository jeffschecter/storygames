Some on the list were sex workers, others were just people who liked sex.<br/><br/>And many random tables in various D&amp;D and OSR books I've seen have the occasional "brothel" or "wanton hussy" and stuff thrown in there on otherwise good or usable random tables.<br/><br/>And, like, if I say <i>anything</i> about it I'm a conservative bigoted prude holding other women back, apparently. And like OK. I'm not gonna.<br/>But.<br/><br/>Ever notice something? Nine times out of ten, these tables are from some sort of male gaze perspective. It's always "a harlot" and never "a john that tries to buy sex from you". It's always "a sexy hussy" and never "a guy that stares you up and down trying to size you up".<br/><br/>And, like, of course that's <i>good</i> in a way; we don't want to subject the players to be subjected to that sort of behaviour, we don't want to be harassed, we play D&amp;D for many reasons but sometimes to escape.<br/><br/>So. I'm working on a big campaign and I'm computerizing a lot of roll tables and I'm copying over a roll table (from <i>Tome of Adventure Design</i>) for random message or coded letter and there are twenty random message recipient's and one of those are "a wanton hussy". There's no "someone who considers you a wanton hussy" or no "Someone who's completely leching on you" and no "Someone who wants to burn you at the stake because they think you're an SJW whatever that is".<br/><br/>But. I put in instead "A lover". The random message is for a lover. That's sweet and that makes me happy.<br/><br/>Thanks                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454414/#Comment_454414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T16:37:49+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  4:37PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It's recently appeared to me that AD&amp;D 1e constitutes a crystallization of a lot of the worst elements of the hobby at that time.  And by "worst", I don't mean "not my taste", I mean people really not playing nicely together at all.  "Trick and lie to those obnoxious players you have to deal with" advice in the DMG is the poster boy here, but the attitude seems pretty pervasive.  So, anything from that era that still seems useful enough to bother with is still probably begging for various improvements.  Cool to see you tackling that!<br/><br/>Sadly, I'm not at all surprised by the 1979 assumption that D&amp;D was exclusively male players playing male characters.  I imagine the barriers to entry for women were even higher back then than now (maybe vastly so).  I wonder when D&amp;D caught on among mixed-gender groups of high school and college friends?  Those were my play groups in the late '90s, and thus what always seemed "normal" to me.<br/><br/>Pardon the random aside.  I think "a lover" is a definite improvement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454415/#Comment_454415" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T16:44:09+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  4:44PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the word <i>Paramour</i>, which has a sort of illicit connotation but not necessarily. <i>Liaison</i> would also work.

Those original tables are very... well, they seem like they were written by a bunch of 12-yr-olds, frankly.  <br/><br/>The only place where I differ from your point of view is that I think in some games it could be *quite* interesting to have a "someone hits on you"/"someone falls in love with you" kind of result. Of course we don't want harassment in-game any more than we do in real life, but if it was handled with maturity it could be fruitful. (Ahem.)<br/><br/>My general approach has been - when I use some kind of random generation procedure for NPCs - to include a list of types of people, and then, somewhere in the process, another result which could read "this person is your lover" or "this person is interested you" or "this person is a potential love interest". (Slight differentiation between "already in relationship", "someone is interested in you", and "you might be interested in this person", which could be meaningful or could just be left up to the player.)<br/><br/>For instance, in my own sort of "home D&amp;D", I have a table of "people you know in town" which every player rolls on, and one of the entries is, "Roll again - this person is your lover". That's been pretty satisfactory.<br/><br/>So that's my preference for this kind of thing: some kind of combination of randomness. One roll to generate the NPC (after all, even if it's a "harlot", it would be nice to know *something* else about the person!), and then another to indicate that there is potential for sex or romance. That can be really fun, because you could roll up, for example, that the captor of the princess you're trying to rescue actually has the hots for one of the characters (and since it's random, it could easily end up being a same-sex attraction or something even more surprising). I'd love to play in a D&amp;D game where we all find that the party's aged Wizard was involved in a youthful romance with the aging King (decades ago).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454428/#Comment_454428" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T17:40:06+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  5:40PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So that's my preference for this kind of thing: some kind of combination of randomness.

D&amp;D was originally inspired by a genre of literary fantasy where a major theme - to me the most central one - is a monolithic review of the male mythos. Patriarchal social mores, wanton harlots, eager barmaids, mysterious courtesans and damsels in distress are central plot and milieu elements, and I believe this to have been in Gygax's mind at the time, rather than simple desire to air his misogyny at random. He was presumably trying to help a GM populate a city that Conan would come home to; you'd roll to find out what sort of woman the conquering hero finds for his lap this time around, which may then inspire further events, as often occurs in the genre.<br/><br/>And yes, of course the mere fact that D&amp;D refuses to speak explicitly about its literary objectives in itself makes it impossible to defend its literary choices as being merely that; if you want to pretend that your game is "generic fantasy", devoid of thematic choices, then you'll get to answer for critiques of the way you portray women (instead of being critiqued for an interest in old fantasy literature, I suppose). It wouldn't have taken much for Gygax to suggest that while this table would be appropriate for the <i>Thieves' World</i> or <i>Lankhmar</i>, it is not intended to represent a realistic demographical portrayal of a semi-medieval city. Instead, of course, we get the same pseudo-scholastic engineering tone throughout the book, where everything, no matter how ridiculous, is presented as serious and comprehensive setting simulation. No self-reflection at all to his process, which is the greatest wonder for me - he's just writing that stuff out, and it never occurs to him to explain a bit about where he's coming from and why he's doing things. Cryptic, in addition to occasionally being genuinely hamfisted.<br/><br/>In case it's not clear, the above's not intended as a counter-point to Sandra - she is of course absolutely correct in saying that this type of material is from an exclusively male heteronormative perspective. I just pointed out the reason, that the game at the time was specifically captivated by a literary tradition that was practically male-exclusive. D&amp;D has in fact through its own evolution transformed the genre of fantasy into something vastly more modern and less politically sensitive than its own inspirations were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454457/#Comment_454457" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T20:35:51+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  8:35PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not weird that it's there, it's straight out of Lankhmar or High Plains Drifter.<br/>It's just a part of it that ends up in practice -- probably unintentionally -- being: "This is who our audience is.

However, it also seems very logical that a lot of women (and some men) would have been driven away from the game due to such pieces of puzzle being in play. And that's unfortunate (although, happily, it seems to be changing in a positive over the decades!).<br/><br/>As Eero says, the "Random Harlot" table makes sense in a context where we are building "fiction" together. We're making a Conan story, and those often have "harlots". Or, we're making a story where it would dramatically appropriate to have a female character to fulfill this role at this point, as a clich\xe9d story beat we can all recognize as being appropriate to the source fiction. In that case, it could be useful to roll on such a table to get some more detail.<br/><br/>It still means that the game effectively "isn't for girls", unless all they want to do is portray hulking chauvinistic male heroes re-enacting pulp fantasy cliches, of course.<br/><br/>However - again, as Eero says - D&amp;D liked to draw on a pretension of historical simulation (presumably from its wargame roots), and the authors didn't seem to see that writing a chapter on accurate currency exchange and land use in a medieval milieu and then including something like the "Random Harlot" table might have required a little more explanation...<br/><br/>The very same thing would go for a hypothetical "princess" game which featured random tables like, "101 Stupid, Charming Princes to Meet at the Ball". It makes a great deal of sense if you're trying to recreate a particular type of story for a very particular audience. It doesn't make much sense if you're trying to create a flexible game that would be fun for <i>everyone</i> to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454466/#Comment_454466" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T21:05:03+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  9:05PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG, put in some charming princes tables right now!<br/>I'm not sarcastic<br/>That would seriously alleviate a lot about how one-sided it is                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454467/#Comment_454467" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T21:05:44+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  9:05PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, they did end up excluding girls in all sorts of ways. I get the sense that - I think I've seen more than one of those old-timers explicitly say this - the question wasn't even on their radar due to the historical context in which the game was being developed early on.  As was already said, the wargaming hobby was a male thing, and not only weren't there many girls playing, it didn't even occur to Gygax and company that they might be doing something that would become hugely popular, with potential to bring in entirely new demographics of people. They were working in a valley, and could not see how they were changing the landscape of the wargaming hobby for the first decade or so.<br/><br/>Again, not trying to justify anything, just expanding on the reasons for why it came out the way it did. Later on TSR changed tack (from purely mercenary motives; the people there who might have cared to write this or that kind of fantasy for literary reasons didn't call the shots) and started trying to scrupulously present a game that is for both boys and girls. Of course, there is a variety of opinions on how well the well-meaning, obviously artificial and cliched as hell gender equality worked in the later TSR fare <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461377/#Comment_461377" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T07:55:10+00:00" title="March 25, 2017  7:55AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Of course, there is a variety of opinions on how well the well-meaning, obviously artificial and cliched as hell gender equality worked in the later TSR fare <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nIt was pretty good                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461478/#Comment_461478" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-27T06:21:15+00:00" title="March 27, 2017  6:21AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember that table.
