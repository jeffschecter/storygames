                            ...which really sucks ass in a bad way.<br/><br/>I'm running through Tenra in a really hard rate right now, basically giving up on mini-vacations, free time and relaxing stuff in a pace that will push this thing out by Fall, and GenCon SoCal was the perfect event for a general release.  <br/><br/>Plus, I wanted to see my best friend this year over at his hizzy in Oakland, and it was a perfect setup to do one right after the other.<br/><br/>So that kinda nukes that plan.<br/><br/>Quick question for the West-coasters, though:  Which of the above events listed in that email is "the best"?  Also, which is located closest to SF?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Conquest is still in some serious growing pains. It will be in it's third year of new ownership with 2007's show, and has a lot of growing up to do. It gets maybe 1,000 - 1,200 attendees, and has it roots in the Miniatures/Historical gaming arena. Much of the Role-Playing was a little scattered, and the RPGA gets a lot of space at the show. I do know there was some Story Game representation in terms of actual play, so there is that. As always, we will be in the dealer's room this year representing whatever we can get our hands on to help support this community.<br/><br/>Ch<br/>-EndGame                        </div>

                            My friend who attends lots of gaming cons has a high opinion of KublaCon (though I've never been myself, on account of it's on the same weekend as <a href="http://www.fanime.com/" rel="nofollow">FanimeCon</a>), and likewise for <a href="http://www.dundracon.com/" rel="nofollow">DunDraCon</a>, which seems something of a glaring omission. Granted, being in May and February (respectively), neither of these really helps Andy, in all likelihood.                        </div>

                            Dundracon is my favorite of the three bay area shows and is going on it's 32nd(?) year, although working with the staff this year has been more challenging than in the past. It always hovers around 1,800 - 2,000 people. The dealers room is pretty ok, and there will be some Story Game representation in the play areas.<br/><br/>Kublacon is the biggest of the three shows in the area, with almost 3,000 people attending. The dealers room is larger, and has much more manufacturer support than Dundrcon or Conquest. I would say the staff does a great job in each of their respective areas, but seemingly have no process to allow them too coordinate between themselves. This can lead to a lot of behind the scenes fire-drilling. I think they are better at coming off organized though.<br/><br/>Both shows are seriously pushed for space. Dundrcon lost the RPGA because they were unhappy at the space they were given, so thy took their ball, and formed their own little show that weekend elsewhere.This allows for a lot more "other Role-Playing." Kubla has a very large RPGA presence, and they take up a lot of room.<br/><br/>Neither of the three shows in the area will give you the national type attention a Gencon would...but Kubla sure wants to be there some day.                        </div>

I volunteered for for the first one, got my Shatner-autographed t-shirt, and a working shirt. Never could attend again, due to conflicting responsibilities and their very inconvenient schedule. <br/>

                            ...wow.  Okay, so much for that plan.  I guess Sons of Liberty will be coming out at OrcCon 2008.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I'm really not that broken up about it.  GenCon SoCal really felt like it was trying too hard to be its older brother, and the GenCon folk didn't seem to have much interest in letting it be its own thing.<br/><br/>Andy, the Strategicon cons (OrcCon, Gamex, Gateway) are cute little cons, and a handful of us are pimping the indie games <em>hard</em> there.  By contrast with GenCon, the Strategicon cons are simple affairs where a ton of people show up and play games.  There's no hype or thousand-dollar booths, it's just actual play, and that's hard to beat.                        </div>

                            That is quite a shame.  I was enjoying my winter excursions to SoCal.  But, that just means I'll have to go down to some of the other L.A. cons instead.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that the con that just started in my home town -- ConQuest Sacramento -- will take off.  They're having their second year in April, and I'm going to sign up to run a couple games.  I'd like to rock the indie gaming up here, see if I can't spread the love to those who don't make it to the other cons around here.                        </div>

By my provincial Pacific Northwest Standards, it's actually reasonably sized and quite lively.  The convention management is a bit wonky (I like to say that Gamestorm keeps being successful despite everything the organizers can do), but the energy is good, and their are lots of players.  I've been going for a number of years now and always have a great time.  I'm glad to hear that there will be some folks there pimping the story game love this year.  The Con scene in the PNW has been quite lively of late, with Conquest NW (just two weesk away!), Gamestorm (Next month!), Dragonflight (August), and now the Emerald City Gamefest (Novemberish) providing a steady calendar, when just a few years ago it was Dragonflight all by its lonesome.  I went down to GenCon SoCal a couple years back, and it actually felt like there was LESS gaming then I get in at the typical Gamestorm.  No acres of dealers, but who cares?<br/>

I like ConQuest.  It has gone through some changes in management, and they've had some issues, but I strongly preferred it to my experiences at DunDraCon.  KublaCon is also quite good.

That concerns me.  I am worried that at least one of the two indie games I submitted for ConQuest Sac won't get off the ground just due to lack of players.  The smaller cons feel a lot more cliquish -- or rather, seems to preserve a lot more of the cliquishness of the surrounding community -- though, that could just be my experiences.                        </div>

                            Ryan, I found that to some degree at the Strategicons, but starting with Paul's name -- he's got a reputation as a good GM -- and just two conventions under my belt, I have people flagging me down in the halls and asking me if I'm running games.  So while your first outing may not pan out, I <em>highly</em> recommend patience (and I highly recommend wingmen).<br/><br/>When in April?  I'm almost tempted to figure if I can make it to Sacramento.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>When in April?  I'm almost tempted to figure if I can make it to Sacramento.</blockquote>
That would so rock.  April 13-15 ( <a href="http://www.avalonconventions.com/conquestsac/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.avalonconventions.com/conquestsac/</a> ).  I'm probably going to get a room instead of just crashing at home, given the distance -- I'd be willing to offer crash space if you come up.<br/><br/>I started getting a bit of a rep at GenCon SoCal, so I figure I could probably work the same mojo up here.  I'm hoping that maybe if I work the local con scene, I can do some good for our games that don't get the attention they deserve.<br/><br/>Last year I didn't run anything, mainly because the games I was going to run were put at really inconvenient times for me.  It'll probably be the case this year as well, but getting a room will ease that.  Whereas I mainly wanted to play in Hite's game and get a few drinks with him last year (which, hey, I'll still do if opportunity presents), this year I'm of a mind to pony up -- this is the con my little city gets, so I can't expect it to be the con I want it to be without putting in some effort, right?                        </div>
