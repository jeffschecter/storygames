For example, say I had turned it into a point-build system (ala True20), but that every point used to create your character was tied to an experience that character had in the imaginary past before play started or (if gained through advancement) an experience that occurred in game.  So you'd have traits like "+1 Strength, inherited from my mother, who toiled in the fields her entire life."  And that might combines with a couple other traits to give you +3 Strength total, that kind of thing.  Skills and powers the same way.  And that's just the tip of <a href="http://firmamentproject.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">this very hacky iceberg</a>.<br/><br/>Where would I go to find other game designers to talk to about the implications of this?  I need to find people who are way more familiar with d20/OGL stuff than I am, but are into batshit crazy hack ideas in the manner of a lot of indie roleplaying enthusiasts.

I can also run your hacks by Nick Logue who works for Paizo and is also hyper familiar with how the system works. In terms of where to talk about it online, I'm not sure. I always looked at Mutants and Masterminds as a tool set that can be used to create almost any D20 game as it has rules for creating feats and powers. The Masterminds supplement is also excellent and expands this tool set with many tested rules variations for inspiration. Maybe the M&amp;M; forums? Also possibly: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/community/gaming/dnd" rel="nofollow">http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/community/gaming/dnd</a> or <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.enworld.org/forumdisplay.php?f=45" rel="nofollow">http://www.enworld.org/forumdisplay.php?f=45</a>.

I don't have it in front of me now, but it's something like: one core quality, one disadvantage, at least two and no more than four each of inherent, experiential, and resources. Or something like that.<br/><br/>Your recent post on FoF looks like a really cool take on that. I like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141175/#Comment_141175" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T15:24:46+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  3:24PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Where would I go to find other game designers to talk to about the implications of this? I need to find people who are way more familiar with d20/OGL stuff than I am, but are into batshit crazy hack ideas in the manner of a lot of indie roleplaying enthusiasts. Is there such a promised land of both milk AND honey?</blockquote>\noh hai.<br/><br/>I've been hacking OGL/d20 for...    Ur.  A while.  On and off, but still.   And I *still* don't have a good place to do it.<br/><br/>Wherever you go to work on this, you must tell me.  Do it here.  Do it over there.  Do it in seven places at once.  If you find an environment that really sings, and do not say so, I will keel you with my brain.  Hell, if you slapped up a new vanilla-land for people working on weird-ass d20/OGL hackery, I'd join it on the spot and start dragging my screwball resources there.<br/><br/>k thx bai.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
