There's plenty of drama to be had both on and off the pitch, though, so it seems like a natural for a group of people wanting to play out some soapy melodrama punctuated by on-field action.<br/><br/>But what system to use?  I'll admit I considered <i>PTA</i> because it seems like every time I think of some idea that would make for a good game, inevitably someone will come along and say, "<i>PTA</i> can do that."  But I'm unsure of the game's ability to deliver the kind of dramatic match play I envision, where players put it on the line for success (or dramatic failure).<br/><br/>Which brings me to <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/up-go-the-heads" rel="nofollow">Up Go the Heads</a>, a dirt-simple system from Gregor Hutton that seems at first blush to do everything I want for this potential game.  But I know that it never hurts to get feedback from people who've actually played the system in question.<br/><br/>Something tells me this is going to be a pretty select group, if it exists at all, but if you've played the game: how did it go?  What did you do?  Would you recommend it for the kind of game I'm thinking of?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257421/#Comment_257421" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T10:27:31+00:00" title="February 21, 2010 10:27AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd use Conspiracy of Shadows Dirty Hands with the Burning Empires-esque macro level conflict representing the upcoming game and off-pitch activities either adding dice to the opponents pool (as the players struggle with their personal problems) or the PCs pool (the players overcome their own personal problems).  <br/><br/>Or, yeah, I'd use PTA because I'd want the game to focus on the Soccer player's lives and their off field issues.  The team/league only being a backdrop to the real drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
