Basically, being part of the party means having 1 more level for everyone in the party.  A party of Strategists is very different from a party of Beefcake/Cheesecakes, or Yari Wielders.<br/><br/>Once the party is created proceed with character creation as normal.<br/><br/>Now, how to do the players' ante?  Awesome tokens for the GM comes to mind, as does giving monters more Powers, Hit Points, and making them worth more XP.  I admit I'm more sketchy on that bit.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
