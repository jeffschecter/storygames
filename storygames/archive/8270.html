I'd say selecting a system that best matches the source material is the greatest advantage. If he has no interest in doing the design himself (as Mark Smylie did with Artesia), I'd suggest enlisting a game designer to do the work with a license (as David Petersen did with Mouse Guard and Jim Butcher did for Dresden Files). Because whether an existing system is used or a new system is created, there's going to be new rules and mechanics (much more so, and more complex for OGL/d20 than, say, Shock or Starblazer Adventures or HeroQuest) and play testing will still need to be done. And a game designer will be a better judge of what system would work best, or even if a new system would work. So put it in the hands of a pro (or at the very least, someone who's actually interested in doing the work - it doesn't sound like he has any interest). The economy is right to find game designers looking for work, too.<br/><br/>If all he's interested in is seeing his property stamped into a game book "that he can just fill in story lines", then yeah, just go OGL. Sure, without testing of the new mechanics to go with those story lines it will be a piece of shit, but it's the most popular free option, and if it looks cool enough it will be purchased anyway, for story ideas at the very least. Although judging from third party sales the past five years, that doesn't translate into very good sales, but I'm sure there will be some and maybe that's all he wants. The sales probably won't be any more than putting some effort into it with a quality design, regardless of the system, that might generate simply from word of mouth and the right "indie" buzz, backed up by solid execution. But if he's already got a large readership that he's trying to milk, instead of a small readership that he's hoping to please and grow, then I can see the appeal of putting in as little effort as possible.  Obviously, not a choice I would make, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182420/#Comment_182420" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T12:10:37+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 12:10PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Alvin said.
