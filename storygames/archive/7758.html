Since June, I've played several games under several different DMs, ran four sessions of a new campaign, and studied the rules carefully.<br/><br/>Sadly, I have come to the conclusion that while it is a very good game, and that I have no problem playing it, it is a poor fit for my game mastering style.  The thought of running a full campaign from levels 1 to 30 just makes me cringe.<br/><br/>The root problem--the deal breaker--for me is the miniatures.  When I am playing, I only have to concentrate on the actions of one character, my own, and I have other players offering me advice.  As the DM, I have to keep the whole picture in my head, and I find that 1) I am a terrible tactician, and 2) I really have no interest in that sort of play.<br/><br/>So, I don't particularly want to junk the fledgeling campaign I started, especially since all the players contributed to its design, I'm looking for suggestions as to what game I could switch to that might be a better fit.<br/><br/>I've already considered <b><i>Burning Wheel</i></b>, but I think that it would be too crunchy for my players (especially the scripting).  Also, one of my players groans loudly whenever I mention it, so I suspect he's had a bad prior experience.<br/><br/>I also considered <b><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i></b> but my attempt to understand it left me with a severe metaphorical headache once I reached the Bringing Down the Pain rules.<br/><br/>I've heard that others have had success with converting D&amp;D 3.5 campaigns to <b><i>Spirit of the Century</i></b>, but the lack of advancement rules probably wouldn't please some of my players.<br/><br/>So, any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mortality" title="Mortality"><img alt="Mortality" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mortality">Mortality</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172070/#Comment_172070" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T07:50:08+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  7:50AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm planning on converting my Iron Heroes campaign to Reign before we start it up again (currently on hiatus).

Most of the<br/>known world bowed to his Obsidian Throne. Magic flourished under his<br/>rule, leading to mighty works such as the Floating City of Lankhmet,<br/>the Crystal Gardens of Torunale, and the Spires of Altihex.<br/><br/>But that all ended suddenly with the Plague. No one knows how it<br/>started, but before long, almost every follower of the Pantheon of<br/>Obsidian fell ill and died horrible deaths\u2026 and then the plague<br/>spread. It killed many, but it twisted the followers of the Pantheon<br/>of Garnet into creatures called tieflings. It looked like that plague<br/>was unstoppable. Only the dragonborn seemed immune, and they were<br/>often killed as carriers.<br/><br/>But the remaining Pantheons (Garnet, Jade, and Ivory) pooled their<br/>resources and enacted the Holy Quarantine. Some of the remaining High<br/>Magic was used to create the Newsea between the seat of the Ankhmar<br/>Empire and the rest of the world. The only remaining landbridges were<br/>former mountain ranges where the dwarves lived. Their tunnels were<br/>sealed and placed under the guard of the Church of the Holy<br/>Quarantine. The Church taught that eternal vigilance was needed to<br/>make sure that whole cities did not fall to the plague, and claimed<br/>that it was created by arcane magic<br/><br/>Now, a mere decade after the fall of Ankhmar, the political landscape<br/>has changed. Where once there was a mighty, homogenous Empire, there<br/>are feuding city states. Where once magic ruled, now there are few<br/>schools or masters of the art, and those fear the Church of the Holy<br/>Quarantine. Where the land was once plowed and worked, now vast<br/>fields lie barren as people fear to leave the safety of the<br/>quarantined cities. Where cities were peaceful and quiet, now they<br/>are overpopulated and ready to burst at the seams.<br/><br/>The Despots of the city-states are all ruthless tyrants. They had to<br/>be to make the decisions that kept the cities alive. But Despot Vidal<br/>of Sindi, the city you are now in, has to be one of the worst. He has<br/>let the city fall into a horrible state, while at the same time<br/>coating the walls of his palace with gold.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Prince Einhard of the Dwarves has declared himself, with<br/>then support of the Holy Quarantine, to be the heir to the Obsidian<br/>Throne, and is demanding that the city-states bow to his authority.<br/>Those who defy him are either conquered or worse, the quarantine<br/>mysteriously fails and the Plague sweeps the city until it falls.<br/><br/>But in times of trouble, there are opportunities. Magical artifacts<br/>from Ankhmar are worth a lot of gold to the right people\u2026 if someone<br/>is brave enough to breach the quarantine, cross the Newsea where elven<br/>pirates sail, find the items from the now monster-infested land, and<br/>return.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Race Rundown<br/><br/>Dragonborn: Immune to the plague, sometimes blamed for it.<br/>Elves: Known for being pirates on the Newsea<br/>Halflings: The Lich-King may have been one\u2026 or maybe he was just short.<br/>Tieflings: Created by the plague, shunned and sometimes persecuted.<br/>Kept in their own areas.<br/>Dwarves: Mostly follow Prince Einhard and fill the ranks of the<br/>Church of the Holy Quarantine.<br/><br/>Anyone got ideas for the others? Here's one from me:<br/><br/>Eladrin: Rare and secretive, they are the primary seekers, teachers,<br/>and buyers of lost magic.<br/>Warforged: The art of constructing these creatures is now lost, but a<br/>few still live and work in the city-states.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172076/#Comment_172076" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T08:17:08+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  8:17AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, <br/>How about Burning Wheel, The Shadow of Yesterday, or Spirit of the Century? ;-)<br/>Seriously, though, another option would be to retrofit your campaign back to D&amp;D 3.5.  <br/>What is your 'game mastering style'?  That's probably a hard question to answer; you may need to get your players to tell us!  But the game choice likely depends on that and the setting you've already invested effort in creating (details of which I now see you've added to the thread).  <br/>In any case, I'd like to see Agon adapted to a D&amp;Desque setting.  Change the gods; change some skill names; provide different heroic abilities for races; different weapons (and spells) for classes, and you've got a variant that works.  Ultimately most things could remain the same but the special effects would be different.   <br/>Alternately, if you remove the setting, Houses of the Blooded would make for a very Machiavellian game played out over the long-term in game time, which I think would fill your players' desire for a sense of advancement.  The setting for HoB has parallels to yours in terms of duelling polities.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172082/#Comment_172082" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T08:25:31+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  8:25AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2008 8:26AM by jhosmer1.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel:<br/><br/>I think that D&amp;D 3.5 has run its course for me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I've been running a game based on Monte Cook's Ptolus setting that has been going very well (and even got some kudos from the designer himself on his forums).

More importantly, the Solar System booklet is only $5 and it has an incredibly clear and simple explanation of "Bringing Down the Pain", as well as the rest of the system. It makes the game really easy to understand, explain, and play. I found Bringing Down the Pain a little obscure and confusing in the original text, but it's laid out very simply and clearly and accessibly in the Solar System booklet.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172089/#Comment_172089" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T08:48:25+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  8:48AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2008 8:52AM by Ignotus.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would definitely avoid d&amp;d 3.5 like the plague - it'll only amplify the problems you're having with 4e.  4e makes life much easier for the DM, particularly in terms of building and managing combat encounters.  In 3.5, monsters and pcs are built in similar ways, which means each monster tends to have many more tactical options.  Instead, I'd suggest looking at comparatively rules-light non-indie rpgs.  Savage Worlds uses miniatures, but one of its selling points is that it makes even big combats easy to GM.  Cinematic Unisystem (used in most Eden Studios rpgs) is also easy to learn and use, and doesn't need miniatures or a battlemat.  Both systems make it pretty easy to come up with "packages" to represent race or class, if you so desire.  Magic will work pretty differently, but I guess that's a given.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172090/#Comment_172090" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T08:55:34+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  8:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two outside-the-box suggestions:<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age, with an oracle tweaked to your setting.<br/><br/>Sorceror, with plague-borne and magic-item demons and Humanity defined as something like love of justice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven" title="buffaloraven"><img alt="buffaloraven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven">buffaloraven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172091/#Comment_172091" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T08:57:12+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  8:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a 4e GM, I've learned more than I thought I would about tactics!  If it's not too late to salvage the system, I'd suggest trying a couple of things.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1) Move the minis.  Even if there's no real tactical advantage, keeping the combat fluid helps to keep it exciting, and even if you don't have great tactics and the PCs are probably gonna wipe the floor with the baddies, they'll still have fun.  <br/>\n2) Don't stress about the chump change.  In WoW terms, there's Trash, and then there's Boss.  No one really cares how the trash mobs function, or even if they are functioning well.  They want to get through them, prove that they have what it takes to make it to the boss, and then get to the boss!  <br/>\n3) Plan out the boss-type fights.  This is where all the stops come out.  Rig the combat as much in your favor as you want so that the bad guy has clear, to you, options for fighting, retreat, and general badguy ness(speeches, etc).  On a boss-type fight, the PCs will truly have no idea what abilities the bad guy has.  Using that to your advantage can, in some cases make the PCs tactics moot in terms of what effect they have on you and your tactics.  For instance, Kalarel in Keep on the Shadowfell (SPOILER) starts out in one place, throws ranged magic, and when a PC gets close, teleports halfway across the room.  There, he has an anchor that gives him power.  The fight ends up having the PCs attempting to get Kalarel out of the anchor zone, and Kalarel trying to get back in it while burning down characters.  Relatively simple tactics, relatively straightforward, but it can be really interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should keep most fights exciting and fluid, as well as being a bit less stressful.  My opinion, as a player and a DM, is that there's nothing more boring than playing 4e likes its 3.x.  Fluid, relatively quick trash encounters followed by a spectacular boss fight might keep the shine on your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172092/#Comment_172092" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T09:00:24+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  9:00AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely think Burning Wheel without subsystems might do you well.

The rules don't prevent Bob from talking a lot and Charlie from being passive. They regulate what Spartacus can do based on what Bob says, but at no point do they prevent Bob from talking at all. Likewise, even if Kratos could something via the rules, that won't happen if Charlie doesn't feel able to actually say something. <br/><br/>That said, I love Agon. It has a very good track record of success at SGBoston, and that success comes in the context of a highly randomized player base and poor social cohesion.

A similar option would be to play some iteration of old D&amp;D with considerably simpler rules, or even <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> - those are all, especially the older D&amp;Ds, very understandable and easy to play, so there would be no crunch assimilation involved.<br/><br/>If you decide to give <i>Solar System</i> a try, let's have a separate discussion about hacking it for the purpose. You'd need to create some major crunch (races, classes, setting features) to hook it into your on-going campaign in a way that'd feel substantial. Not impossible, but certainly an enjoyable project for a couple of nights. SS would also shift the focus of the game clearly out of adventuring as a procedure and more into why and what and how the adventurers are doing whatever they're doing - and with good chances that the characters break out of the adventuring frame and go do their own thing at some point. <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, <i>Sorcerer</i> and other such not-really-adventure-games suffer from the same considerations to various degrees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172173/#Comment_172173" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T14:42:12+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  2:42PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2008 2:45PM by Mike_Sands.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhosmer1</cite>Hmmm... well, the one time I played Agon, I came away from the game with the feeling that the more experienced players monopolized the game.  </blockquote>\nAh, that's a different issue - experienced players will certainly have an advantage in making the most of the system.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>The rules don't prevent Bob from talking a lot and Charlie from being passive</blockquote>\nNo, not that, but any attempt by Bob to gain glory allows Charlie to join in and also try to gain it.

It's simple to build races and classes in the core system. There is a very very very light tactical combat system there if you want it (to use minis, etc) otherwise you can pretty much do it in your head like most games: Combat tends to be trading a bunch of blows, you don't need to know where your mini is to engage.<br/><br/>TSOY is great for fantasy, but you can't have monster fights anymore:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=103528" rel="nofollow">Games for Campaign Play # 34</a><br/>If your gaming group is fine without using monsters, it might be something to look into.<br/><br/>I've had mixed results with Agon. I dug it when I want to be all "EXXXTREME!!!!" and all, but it doesn't handle non-competitive scenes too well. Like, frex, I remember at the end of one of our adventure tracks, we just wanted to "heal up and get to the next adventure", but if I'm recalling right, it wasn't possible in the rules as written - We had to grudgingly go through conflicts we didn't care about all that much or weren't too interested in, so that we could roll the dice, get the heals, and move on. We just wanted to move on, but couldn't without those extra scenes.<br/><br/>In any case, if you go with Agon, make sure you play it with the group as-is once first, and then move on from there.<br/><br/>If you didn't have a lot of 4E trappings already in your game, I would totally second Burning Wheel for what you're doing. Problem is that switching this late in the game means that you're going to be doing a LOT of conversion, no matter what system you choose. At least something like Savage Worlds is such that making a character is really easy. But with TSOY, BW, Riddle of Steel or whatever, you're going to be doing a LOT of conversion.<br/><br/>Oh, what about <a href="http://www.change-works.com/sb/questers/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Questers of the Middle Realms?</a> Rules light system, easy and fun to get into, popular support, and you can do monster fights and the like with no problem. Character conversion from 4e thematically would be pretty easy, too, I'd wager.<br/><br/>Another generic-ish one I might recommend is <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/204470" rel="nofollow">OVA</a>. It's a rather generic system that's light, and yet still meaty enough to satisfy if you don't want to go the route of Risus or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, good luck. I've never had much success changing rules systems mid-stream in a campaign. It just never seemed to work out for me in the end. Hopefully you'll have some success.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172194/#Comment_172194" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T16:18:38+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  4:18PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Storn</cite>Savage Worlds...SW can be run with or without minis</blockquote>\nSavage Worlds is a lovely game, but I'd recommend against it if you're not into minis play.  Minis play is what Savage does, and (I think) it does it very, very well.<br/><br/>Since so many of its rules directly address battlemap stuff, you'll have to either a) explicitly disallow those bits, b) make up some freeform positioning rules that'll substitute for the exact measurements of the battlemap, or c) rule on a case-by-case basis about how those rules apply to the current situation, which invites understanding clashes between GM and players.  <br/><br/>Because of this, Jeffrey, I'd recommend sticking to a game that doesn't assume figures and a battlemap.  I echo Eero and Andrew -- if you want something that's like D&amp;D4, but much less involved, consider older editions of (A)D&amp;D and games inspired by them.<br/><br/>Castles and Crusades is the D&amp;D retrogame I'm most familiar with -- it's a rules-light D&amp;Dish game with a consistent core mechanic and a heavy reliance on GM fiat, which makes it fairly easy to translate stuff into.  The D&amp;D Cyclopedia has hardcore fans and is readily available in PDF on dtrpg.  Red Box Hack looks interesting and is a bit pervy but is also MIA of late.  I don't know much about OSRIC, but that's out there too.<br/><br/>Be warned that the characters won't be nearly as mechanically interesting in an older D&amp;D-type game as they were in 4E, since the menu of character build options is much constrained.  Wizards especially will be diminished.  So if your players get off on twinking out their character builds, they might not like this option. <br/><br/>Hey, that's a good question -- what do your players like?  What games would be no-gos for them?<br/><br/>good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172196/#Comment_172196" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T16:21:12+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  4:21PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you could always go way out and try Dogs. I'd worry that you were moving kind of far from the spirit of Dogs and from D&amp;D, but I could see it being fun.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, in some ways 4E and Dogs have a lot in common. Both have you chose a basic concept (class role in 4E, background in Dogs) and then fill it in with whatever flavor you want (arguably a ranger and a rogue are both strikers with the same flavor, just like two characters with complicated community could be very different). Both of them place the PCs in an elevated social role (to some degree). Both of them have a strong emphasis on keeping flavor and dice loosely coupled, so you can represent the same flavor many ways (with many dice, or many powers). <br/><br/>Granted, they don't have much in common beyond those basic philosophies, but the more I think about this, the more I can see it working.<br/><br/>You could even keep a semblance of 4E by requiring all characters of a given race to have a trait at at least a certain dice (all dwarves have to buy hardy at at least 1d6, or somesuch). You could rephrase backgrounds to be a little closer to classes, if you really wanted. The game already has a built in idea of magic and dark evil magic (something D&amp;D tends to do, more or less), since you character's magic is just a trait, while the other stuff is demons and such from Dogs. Rituals are already kind of there, you could just expand what they're applicable to. In place of the Dog's coat, you can have each PC have a signature item (something that D&amp;D flirts with from time to time with weapon specialization and such). Maybe replace the 'big' item dice bonus with 'magic' so you have typical D&amp;D magic items (not too much flavor, make you more awesome).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172200/#Comment_172200" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T16:43:57+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  4:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, if you go the Dogs route, I'd suggest keeping talking, physical, and fighting, but replacing gunplay with whatever the characters "class" would have for big guns.  <br/>We set up for this, but didn't get to play it yet.

Or are they alright with it?  This just seems like the sort of thing where you would need a lot of player buy in, and what I've seen so far of your comments is that all the systems you are thinking about would bring opposition.  Not saying you should DM a system you aren't comfortable with, but honestly, if your players want to play 4e, maybe you should switch DMs or just close the campaign rather than forcing them into a situation that they aren't all that interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, and this may be too late, if you haven't talked to them already, I'd suggest not mentioning that you've ordered books until after you get their buy-in.  Nothing is worse for a game, in my opinion, than a GM that accidentally guilts people into playing because of the investment they've put into the game.

Those choices remove points from different finite pools.<br/><br/>- Clinton                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172268/#Comment_172268" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T07:18:23+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  7:18AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buffaloraven</cite>Curiosity compels me to ask this:<br/><br/>Are your players in agreement that you need to change the system? Or are they alright with it? This just seems like the sort of thing where you would need a lot of player buy in, and what I've seen so far of your comments is that all the systems you are thinking about would bring opposition. Not saying you should DM a system you aren't comfortable with, but honestly, if your players want to play 4e, maybe you should switch DMs or just close the campaign rather than forcing them into a situation that they aren't all that interested in.<br/><br/>Finally, and this may be too late, if you haven't talked to them already, I'd suggest not mentioning that you've ordered books until after you get their buy-in. Nothing is worse for a game, in my opinion, than a GM that accidentally guilts people into playing because of the investment they've put into the game. Not trying to be mean/snarky/whatever, just throwing it out there.</blockquote>\nI've sent an e-mail to our discussion group, explaining my misgivings about the system.  (In a way, discussing it here has helped me understand exactly what I feel about this.)  We're going to talk about it at the next session.<br/><br/>As I see it, we have several possible courses of action:<br/><br/>1)  Change DMs<br/>2)  Change systems, but keep the campaign<br/>3)  Play something else<br/>4)  Stop Playing<br/><br/>(I'm hoping that they don't choose <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>...I'm guessing that they'll choose <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but that's OK.)<br/><br/>The whole point of this thread was so that I'd have some options to present them.  I hated to do this, but I felt that a non-enthusiastic GM was worse than the possibility of the group breaking up.  It's not the first time that the group has changed DMs and games, though.  I took over from the old GM when it was obvious to everyone, including him, that he was burnt out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172272/#Comment_172272" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T07:24:43+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  7:24AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went through a phase where I was really bad about suddenly changing systems or games or characters on my players.
