What might help is if you can get an active participant from here to review your game, but I can't think off the top of my head too many people here who regularly review games (nor do I know if that actually matters to anyone). And even then, it wouldn't be posted here, most like it would end up on rpg.net.<br/><br/>However, I would say that the way to get known in indieland isn't reviews, but rather some combination of participation in the community (at the lowest level would mean fielding questions about your game and announcing the sale of your game in public forums that are located in indieland) and actual play. <br/><br/>Like if I want to know which game is hot right now, I would say 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars. How do I know? Because there have been quite a few threads recently on story games that have 3:16 in their subject line. Either to announce the sale of the game, for rules questions, or for actual play threads.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh hey, I could also be really wrong about the best way to get your game known in indieland, after all I'm not an indie game designer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malladin_ben" title="malladin_ben"><img alt="malladin_ben" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malladin_ben">malladin_ben</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160098/#Comment_160098" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T13:19:08+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  1:19PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Heya, unfortunately I personally don't have time to compose reviews, as I'm too busy playing (and working).

Let's get more info on the actual game itself!)</blockquote>\nThanks Andy, I'll try to answer your questions and give a bit better idea of what you can expect from Gateway. As a start, though, there's some threads on our own foums that go into a bit more detail <a href="http://malladinsgate.lefora.com/" rel="nofollow">(link)</a>.<br/><br/>Answers:<br/><br/>1: Any "scene" in the game is described as a number of "entities" within the scene - the PCs are entities, as are their adversaries, but also obstacles and hazards for them to overcome, and even more abstract "problems" that need to be dealt with. The Drama resolution system provides a universal system for resolving the conflicts between these different entities that make up the drama in the system. Rather than trying to kill the main boss bad guy (as an example common to trad rpgs) the goal of the system is to climax the scene in some dramatically appropriate way that defeats the scene's key entity (or entities). Players can describe any action they can imagine and then define it in terms of the ebb and flow of tension within the scene - the system provides the framework for how this works. Does that make sense? It's hard to summarise 10 pages or so of system mechanics into just a few sentences.<br/><br/>2. There is one in the zip file for download, but I will put one on my site shortly too and provide a link when I have done so.<br/><br/>3. It's a universal system and doesn't come with a setting (although you can purchase a setting for it for 99c). It has a simple yet highly adaptable system that can be used for a wide range of genres, and the core of the system is designed to allow you to add the appropriate flavour for whatever seting you're playing. There are systems which I think are different enough from what has gone before, but when I've described them here before people seem to find the descriptions similar to other indie games. Perhaps the most important thing that may sell it to some people came out of the previous discussion we had on here - that the gaming background of myself and co-writer is in trad games (d20, SW, WoD, etc), and that as we're not steeped in the whole indie scene we might have a fresh and interesting take on things (according to one respondee to the previous thread on Gateway).<br/><br/>4. The d8s thing was weird how it came about. We'd toyed with d10s, but they were too random and then we ditched them for d6s which were mainly okay, but did mean that some levels of chalenge that you might expect to have some, albeit slim, chance of success at, you actually had none. When I did the maths on the probability behind it all it was incredible how well d8s just bridged the gap nicely, whilst also making the relative points cost of the different character components (based on their level of game effect) a lot simpler. It is just d8s, no other dice, you roll a small pool (no more than 4, usually 2 or 3) and pick the best single roll.<br/><br/>Also, I've flicked through Primetime adventures in store and I'm fairly sure Gateway approaches things in a very different way.<br/><br/>Cheerio for now, and thanls for the feedback,<br/><br/>Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malladin_ben" title="malladin_ben"><img alt="malladin_ben" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malladin_ben">malladin_ben</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160203/#Comment_160203" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-01T03:10:55+00:00" title="August  1, 2008  3:10AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2008 4:51AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a link to the character sheet: <a href="http://www.malladinsgate.com/downloads/previews/Gateway_CharacterSheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.malladinsgate.com/downloads/previews/Gateway_CharacterSheet.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
