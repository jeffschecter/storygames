John is, once again, trying to play <i>First Blood</i> on his projector that he modified to use flash drives (the only mobile medium left). The rest of the party is complaining that they never watch anything else and demand a suggestion box that is easily found. John mumbles as he leaves the theatre and begins searching his house for a box. Suddenly there is a knock at the door and John sees flashing lights through his window and hears a siren. Upon answering the door, John is face-to-face with Captain Smith himself, wearing a black duster with a wall on fire as a shoulder patch, sun bifocals, and wielding a cane with a silver computer monitor as the cane's head. Smith reports rumors of "unauthorized" material in the area and asks to come in, to which John accepts. A struggle is called. If I win, the secret theatre is discovered. If the YOs win, the Firewall have to leave the house. Smith begins wandering the house, knocking on walls and floor boards, as two more Firewall block the doorway of the house. John stands up, rolling on Thrills. He strips naked in a nearby room and bolts out of the house, knocking down both Firewall in the process. Smith rages at them to quit being worthless as he begins trashing the house and the two Firewall ran after John. John stands up again, failing with a roll of 7. Not wanting to fail this early, John sells out Tough to Vicious. He spies a large rock, picks it up, and clothes lines one of the Firewall with it, sending teeth and blood flying. He then pile drives the other one and hears a sicking snap on the concrete. He dodges just in time into an alleyway as a Firewall patrol discovers the two bodies, calling Smith to investigate. By the time John gets home, his house is a wreck, but Smith has left to investigate the murders. He puts his pants back on, pulls a drawer out, walks into the theatre and throws down the new "suggestion box", then proceeds to watch <i>First Blood</i>.<br/><br/>Kick-Off: How long will the smuggling ring be kept secret?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy" title="VampTheUnholy"><img alt="VampTheUnholy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy">VampTheUnholy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385969/#Comment_385969" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T11:07:13+00:00" title="July 30, 2012 11:07AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2012 11:17AM by VampTheUnholy.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 2: Set up by Q's player<br/>Authority Figure: Captain Edward Smith<br/><br/>The scene starts out the next day with Q "plugged-in" to her terminal at home, sifting through security data for DFI. John and Nyka are at one of his hidden caches of movies/books, hidden in the old abandoned subway. John is trying to better conceal the cache after last night's scare, while Nyka is getting ready to run some old movies to some of John's clients. She fills a backpack full of flash drives and begins hoofing it. After a block, she notices a Firewall cruiser tailing her and I call for a struggle. If I win, the Firewall tails Nyka back to a cache. If they win, Captain Smith is dishonored. Nyka stands up on Fast, booking it around a corner and ducking into an alleyway. The cruiser turns the corner and stops in front of the alleyway, and Captain Smith steps out of the vehicle, a GPS locator in his hand. Q steps up, rolling a failure on 11. Deciding against selling out, Q notices the security data centered around Nyka's location and plans on uploading false data to divert Smith from Nyka. Unfortunately, in a user error, she uploads the coordinates for the real caches. Nyka manages to slip away while Smith begins commanding his men to quickly investigate the cache locations. John manages to narrowly escape the cache with a handful of drives as Firewall swarm the subway, forcing John to escape deeper into the subway tunnels.<br/><br/>Beat 1: Catastrophe - Cultural smuggling ring busted!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy" title="VampTheUnholy"><img alt="VampTheUnholy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy">VampTheUnholy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385970/#Comment_385970" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T11:16:48+00:00" title="July 30, 2012 11:16AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2012 11:17AM by VampTheUnholy.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 3: Set up by John's player<br/>Question: "Why did your parents, when they were still alive, bust my movie/book smuggling ring?"<br/><br/>The scene starts on next week's movie night with John ranting about "how could Firewall have known about the caches?" and Q trying to break the news to him. The vid-link is filled with images of Firewall raiding hidden "illegal" caches across town. The clique leaves the hidden theatre just in time to hear the knock at the door and see the flashing lights in the window. I call for a struggle. If I win, the YOs are arrested. If they win, the local Firewall is disrupted. John stands up, rolling on Vicious. He grabs a kitchen knife and kicks open the door, shouting like a mad man. The door knocks over Captain Smith, who yells at his men to get the YOs. John stands up again, failing on a roll of 10. Not wanting to sell out twice in one episode, John lets the fail stand. He punches the first Firewall in the face and has to get wrestled down to the ground by three of them. The girls are arrested and put in the back of Smith's cruiser, while John is beat and then stuffed into the trunk face first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy" title="VampTheUnholy"><img alt="VampTheUnholy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy">VampTheUnholy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385972/#Comment_385972" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T11:40:47+00:00" title="July 30, 2012 11:40AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 4: Set up by Nyka's player<br/>Authority Figure: Reb Shark<br/><br/>The scene starts a few hours later, with the YOs in a cell in the Central Processing Center (combination city hall and police station) together, having been processed already. The cell door is plexiglass and electronically controlled with, like all good evil villains, an access panel on the inside of the cell. After some discussion of the current plan, John begins banging on the access panel. A Firewall shouts for him to stop that and I call for a struggle. If I win, Captain Smith dies by the clique's hands. If they win, they swipe Smith's security clearance. The Firewall brings Reb Shark (overweight, shirt halfway unbuttoned, comb over, sweat stains all over shirt, incredibly hairy chest, glasses, way too tight pants) over to see if he can "fill any roles". The Firewall, at Reb's request, opens the cell door. John stands up, rolling on Vicious. He tackles Reb to the ground and begins gnawing on him. The Firewall sends out a lockdown order and all the security doors begin closing. Nyka stands up, and rolls a failure on 7. She bolts down the hallway, slipping in the tiny crack between the security door and wall before the door slams shut. She's carried by her momentum into Captain Smith, who is sent tumbling over the railing of the spiral staircase, splatting on the ground below with a crunch. She quickly hacks the nearby security terminal and releases the security measures. Nyka and John escape in the ensuing chaos of the, now escaping, prisoners. Q pretends to turn herself in so she can keep her job and feed the DFI false intel about her clique-mates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy" title="VampTheUnholy"><img alt="VampTheUnholy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy">VampTheUnholy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385981/#Comment_385981" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T13:14:11+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  1:14PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2012 1:15PM by VampTheUnholy.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 5: Set up by me<br/>Authority Figure: M.e.T.H.<br/><br/>The scene starts out a few days later, with the clique hiding in a cache, watching the vid-link. Wanted posters of John and Nyka are all over the vid, mixed with images of Firewall raiding even more of John's caches and pictures of Captain Smith, which the Firewall is using to generate emotional support for their cause. An ad for DFI's new M.e.T.H. comes up. Q did some consultant work for M.e.T.H. and knows that it is incredibly addictive and has the potential to brainwash citizens. The clique decides Q will try to wire herself in to M.e.T.H through her terminal, while Nyka and John will go to the CPU (where the local M.e.T.H. is stored) for a more physical solution if Q fails. John makes some homemade explosives and heads off with Nyka, while Q logs in to her terminal. John and Nyka are almost to the CPU when they hear sirens behind them and turn to see two Firewall exiting a cruiser and I call a struggle. If I win, DFI is able to brainwash the population into thinking the clique wants to destroy their way of life. If they win, they rewire the local M.e.T.H. to send out the word to rebel against the Firewall. Q steps up and rolls on her disorder. She begins hacking into M.e.T.H. with the information she had gained from the consultation, but the program seems to be anticipating her movements. The two Firewall begin questioning John and Nyka and asking what the large backpack John has contains. John stands up and rolls on Sneaky, telling them it's simply some drives that the CPU requested. The Firewall are suspicious, but before they can react, Q steps up and rolls a success on 5 (the number she rolled earlier). She manages to feint the system, hacking M.e.T.H. and corrupting it's previous purpose. The two Firewall are immediately called away as word of civil disobedience spreads across the city. That's when all the vid-links begin posting warnings about martial law now being in effect.<br/><br/>Beat 2: Reversal - Firewall's hold on city is shaken!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy" title="VampTheUnholy"><img alt="VampTheUnholy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy">VampTheUnholy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385987/#Comment_385987" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T14:01:28+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  2:01PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 6: Set up by Q's player<br/>Authority Figure: Reb Shark<br/><br/>The scene starts immediately after the last one. Q is busy locking down the clique's hold on M.e.T.H. and John and Nyka have begun walking to Q's to join up with her. After a few blocks, the clique can see that the rioting has spread across the city and the Firewall are taking no prisoners in putting it down. Suddenly a Firewall cruiser skids to a stop ahead of John and Nyka, while two Firewall and one Reb Shark, now missing a nose (thanks to John), get out of the cruiser. Shark immediately points out John and Nyka as the rabble-rousers and all three of them pull out their guns. I call for a struggle and if I win, martial law is maintained on the city. If they win, The current command structure falls, leaving room for the clique to take over. John steps up first, rolling on Vicious. He lights the homemade explosives he had been carrying and throws them over to the Firewall's cruiser. The Firewall and Shark scatter as the cruiser explodes. Suddenly, someone begins trying to hack into M.e.T.H. and they begin taunting Q in leet speak, calling themselves L33T H4XZ0R. Q stands up and rolls on smarts. Assuming the internet is roughly 50% cats and 50% ponies, she begins mocking Applejack in an effort to trip up the hacker, causing him to rage. The Firewall begin shooting at John and Nyka stands up, rolling on fast. She knocks John to the ground before he gets holes punched in him. As John gets back up, he's tackled by, a now singed, Reb Shark. John takes a stand and rolls on Thrills, rolling through the fire with Shark, igniting Shark and allowing John to get away. Then John hears the gun of the Firewall click behind his head. Nyka stands up, rolling on Altruism. She pleads with the Firewall to look at what he's become. He lowers his gun as the second Firewall tackles John to the ground. John stands up, and rolls a success on Q's smart on 10. John yells through his Head-Uploaded Device (HUD, a pair of glasses that connect individuals wirelessly to the DFI Network/what you plug into the terminals for access) for Q to help him out. She scrambles the Firewall's HUD, causing him to recoil as his senses are assaulted, allowing John to throw him into the fire with Shark. The remain Firewall throws his gun down and leaves. John and Nyka make their way to the CPU while Q locks L33T out of the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy" title="VampTheUnholy"><img alt="VampTheUnholy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VampTheUnholy">VampTheUnholy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385989/#Comment_385989" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T14:59:35+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  2:59PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 7: Set up by John's player<br/>Question: "Why do you work for the government?"<br/><br/>The scene starts off a few hours after the last scene. The clique has converted part of the CPU to function as a center of operations and most of the populace of the dome is celebrating in the streets. The clique decides that they need to get a handle on the dome or everything will devolve into chaos. At this time, a PSA is playing on the vid-link. The Head of DFI is begging citizens to listen to the voice of reason and to cast down the clique for they will bring about the destruction of their way of life. The clique prepares a counter-vid with Nyka asking the population to rise up and throw down the chains of oppression. I call for a struggle. If I win, the DFI is able to generate enough support to go to war with dome 344. If they win, they get the support of the people. Q stands up and rolls on Smarts, trying to block the DFI signal while uploading their own. The Head of the DFI points to this as an attack on the values DFI is trying to give to the people. Nyka stands up and rolls on silver tongue to begin upstaging the DFI's hate-centered speech with the clique's uplifting message. Soon, the entire comm channel gets shut down, replaced by a troll face and a taunt from L33T H4XZ0R. Nyka stands up and wins on Q's smart. Using what she already knows about L33T's hacking technique (poor) and attitude (easily raged), Q blocks his signal, getting Nyka back online.

I was very excited about the game and I felt I had to do my group justice. I don't have any questions off the top of my head, but if I think of anything, I'll ask it. I will be posting our second episode (which was last weekend) as soon as I have the time to sit down and type it out. I must say, however, that I think I'll be playing Misspent Youth with another group that I run (one notorious for infighting) as a means of bringing some group cohesion (which they sorely need and which Misspent Youth seems particularly focused on providing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
