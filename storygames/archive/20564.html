It\u2019s lived inside my head for a long time and this year I decided to finally commit it to paper- and it\u2019s been a lot harder than I thought it would be. It\u2019s only a dozen pages but getting what\u2019s in my head onto the page has been a real struggle. <br/><br/>Rogue &amp; Slayer is a rules lite sword and sorcery rpg powered by a simple narrative driven system. The latest version could be called a hack of Danger Patrol rather than its own thing. But it\u2019s unfinished (though playable) and the text and layout still need a lot of work. <br/><br/>You can find it <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-PhYmPkzsnjcVZQY242M1pNWUk&amp;usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>So tell me what you think!

(Sort of.) Is there any mechanical escalation (even if it's indirect mechanics, like how the countdown timer works?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tiridates" title="Tiridates"><img alt="Tiridates" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/nF8W8KTDXVPRR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tiridates">Tiridates</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451809/#Comment_451809" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-09T22:20:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2016 10:20PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2016 10:21PM by Tiridates.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Escalation comes in two forms though neither offers the mechanical impetus of timed threats.  <br/><br/>The first is the accumulation of Danger tokens. The hero takes a token for every Miss and the Scribe gets to make a \u2018soft move.\u2019 These moves have no real mechanical penalty and are purely descriptive in nature, but the growing stack of Danger tokens provide a very tangible reminder that the hero may fail<br/><br/>The second is when the hero concedes (player invoked fail) or is Defeated (scribe invoked fail). Both of these are triggered by amassing Danger tokens. So in effect the accumulation of tokens (and the narrative moves made by the Scribe) acts as a rudimentary escalation mechanic.   <br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to check it out<br/><br/> <br/>Tiridates <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
