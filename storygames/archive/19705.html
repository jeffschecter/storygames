This is how the DM can make her players design an entire dungeon for her, with no prep required. It rewards the players for introducing dangers while giving the GM license to twist things around, and it can create some interesting complications in and of itself.<br/><br/><br/><b>Legwork</b><br/><br/>When you seek out information on a dangerous place you have yet to explore, say how you do it. If you research old tomes, dusty maps, and bits of lore, roll+INT. If you ask around for people who might know something, roll+CHA. *On a 10+, pick two from the list. *On a 7-9, pick one, and the GM holds +1 Twist.<br/> <br/>- You find part of a map; draw it out or otherwise present it to the group<br/>- You learn of a trap or similar hazard; describe it and hold +1 Preparation (see Bolster)<br/>- You learn of a dangerous denizen or group thereof in the area; describe and/or name them and hold +1 Preparation (see Bolster)<br/>- You learn of valuable treasure; describe it and where its kept<br/>- You learn something useful about the area\u2019s history, layout, or politics; tell us what You gain something that will be particularly useful in there (a key, a password, etc.); tell us what you got<br/><br/>*On a 6-, the GM holds +1 Twist and you pick one from the list above. Don\u2019t describe it yet. Instead, ask the GM what it will cost you or what you must do to gain that benefit. <br/><br/><br/>When the characters enter the dangerous area, the GM can spend 1 Twist to reveal that your information was slightly off, out of date, or incomplete.\ufeff<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><i>"Hey, isn't there supposed to be a passage here? It's on the map..."<br/><br/>"That trap? Oh, it's not a sliding blade, it's an alarm. You hear a growl coming from deeper within the dungeon."<br/>"Oh yes, there's ogres. They're servants of the demon that's taken up residence deeper inside."<br/><br/>"Why yes, this is the tomb of the ancient king Dalboz. Did you remember to wear his colors so his undead servants wouldn't think you're tomb robbers and attack you?"<br/><br/>"Here's the secret door, right where the guy in the tavern said it would be. Anyone got the key, because it's locked."\ufeff</i><br/><br/><br/>(Credit to Jeremy Strandberg from the DW G+ group for his revision.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437797/#Comment_437797" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T13:01:57+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  1:01PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neato.. I dig Dirty Dungeons, after trying it out with <a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/2014/02/world-of-dirty-dungeons.html" rel="nofollow">World of Dungeons</a> and having a blast.<br/><br/>What I noticed was that twists weren't that valuable for me; the adventure was engrossing enough without me having to change anything.  But that might have happened because the players only contributed an above-ground map, and so the precise ordering and layout of the threats they'd mentioned, and in fact how they were rendered was totally up to me.<br/><br/>I've been sketching out a campaign structure based on Dirty Dungeons, and it goes something like this:<br/><br/>When play starts, there's a region containing the players' home town.  (The region could be a 30-mile hex, for example.)  When they seek adventure, they can use the Dirty Dungeons approach to design an adventure location that's within that first region.<br/><br/>Typically, the goal of the first adventure is to plunder (since that's how you get XP in World of Dungeons) - any bonus dice that are still in the pool when they get to the hoard can be used to improve the value of the treasure.<br/><br/>After that, however, they've tapped out the adventure potential of that starting hex, at least for now.  To get more, they need to go on a Dirty Journey.  This is done the exact same way, except instead of treasure they're looking to explore nearby hexes. Travelling through a hex involves dealing with a minimum of (say) 3 problems, so if they sketch out a 6-problem adventure, that could take them into the neighbouring Mudflats and beyond into the Sallow Hills.<br/><br/>As play unfolds, it will become apparent that some of the challenges (e.g. the roller-bandits of the Mudflats) are a persistent problem, which will threaten then any time they travel that way - and they may be revealed to be a full-on Front.<br/><br/>The party can ignore this if they like, they've now got two new unexplored hexes<br/><br/>The payoff from exploring that there are now two new unplundered hexes, so the party can once more plan a Dirty Dungeon to raid (say) the Hive-Queen's Warrens in the Mudflats, or the pale forts of the Sallow Hills.  There probably ought to be some suitable XP reward as well, just to keep things ticking, but not as much as plunder.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, because they ignored the bandits, these are added as additional challenges to the adventure.  They must be dealt with (through threats, violence, or stealth) in the way in, out, or both.<br/><br/>This leads to a third type of session, the Dirty Quest: expel those roller-bandits from the Mudflats!  There's incidental plunder, but not as much as from a Dirty Dungeon: perhaps the players can't spend unused bonus dice on treasure here.  There's a nominal xp reward for kicking ass, but not much.  The real payoff is that the bandits are set back a good ways in terms of being a threat, and now the adventurers can travel through the Mudflats on future delves, explorations, or quests without being impeded.  (They only pay the price in rations for passing through the mudflats.)<br/><br/>On Journeys, the GM can uses twists to mess with the terrain type - turns out the mud flats aren't that flat after all - before the Sallow Hills is the Wyrdbog, which is a miasma that sucks down entire ponies.  This is something they'll have to deal with the entire time, which forces them to take longer journeys around to get to the Sallow Hills - unless they use a Dirty Quest to find a navigable route, or friendly guides through the miasma.  etc. etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437907/#Comment_437907" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T18:29:39+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  6:29PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting...

Anyone who makes a roll for any of the three jobs (scout, quartermaster, or trailblazer) also gets the following additional effects based upon their result. *On a 10+, choose one discovery from the list. *On a 7-9, choose one discovery and one problem. *On a 6-, the GM chooses a problem.<br/><br/>Anyone who is not performing a perilous journey job may instead act as a cartographer, rolling with +INT to get one of the above effects.<br/><br/> - There's a potential dungeon site, describe it, but broadly.<br/> - You find evidence of something valuable to a nearby steading, tell us what you find.<br/> - You find a clue about a danger present in the world, tell how you find it.<br/> - You discover a small dwelling deep in the wilderness, describe one feature about it or the person who lives there.<br/> - You find a landmark of historical or mystical significance, describe it.<br/><br/><br/> - Bad weather or a natural disaster makes things treacherous, tell us what you encounter.<br/> - Roving monsters are nearby, either part of a larger horde or you've stumbled upon a lair. Describe a sign of the danger.<br/> - The paths are difficult, you have to backtrack a few times and the exploration takes longer than planned. Describe what causes you to get lost.<br/> - The harsh environment is making you use up some of your supplies quicker than expected, such as water or feed for your horses. Describe the hazard.<br/> - Your route is impassable, describe what obstacle blocks your progress.<br/> - Something is hunting you... either a hungry predator or the minions of an old enemy. Or maybe you've just stumbled into a trap.<br/> - A grim portent related to a nearby threat comes to pass.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Remember that perilous explorations require danger and risk in the unknown parts of the wild. Walking through an idyllic farmland or on a road through a forest well-patrolled by elven rangers is hardly perilous. If the party is exploring a region that is relatively safe, for example, it borders a nearby well-guarded keep, city or a steading with the Safe tag, they may veto one revealed problem.<br/><br/>Revealed problems may also evolve into persistent threats if they are not dealt with. Some may even become adventure fronts, especially if they are only the forerunners of greater danger. <br/><br/>Remember, if you explore a region and deal with the dangers you encounter, then you've learned something new and important about the world.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437942/#Comment_437942" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-29T12:23:09+00:00" title="August 29, 2014 12:23PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's good.

My guess is that Czege violations are the most unsatisfying when players create problems and then turn to solving them right away.  With Dirty Dungeons, players name the problems, but I suppose it's somewhat abstract:<br/><br/>"An orc attacks me!"<br/>"What do you do?"<br/>"I dodge it!"<br/><br/>The problem the player's created here is very specific, it's an orc swinging a sword.  In Dirty Dungeons, the players contribute problems like:<br/><br/>"The dungeon is full of orcs - there's a whole nest of them near the treasure room."<br/><br/>Okay, this is specific from a stocking view, but it's entirely vague from an action-situation view.  What's the actual problem?  Could it be that the players find orc tracks, but aren't sure where the orcs are?  Do the orcs want bribes to allow players into the area?<br/><br/>So by the time the players actually meet the orcs, the specific problematic situation hasn't really been authored by the players.<br/><br/>The joy (apart from the joy of dungeoneering, if that's your thing) is that the whole time you have this sense of, "Oh my gosh, these tracks.. are these the orcs?!" there's a kind of delight of recognition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437956/#Comment_437956" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-30T05:49:28+00:00" title="August 30, 2014  5:49AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morrius, your alteration of the Undertake a Perilous Journey move is really close to how I'm approaching it in my overland adventure rules for Dungeon World.

There's some demand for a Burning Wheel-style Circles move, and here's what I've come up with so far:<br/><br/>When you declare that you know someone who can help you solve a task and have an unassigned Bond available, describe that person and write a Bond describing your relationship with them. Then roll+CHA. *On a hit, you can get help from your contact. *On a 7-9, there\u2019s a catch, choose one:<br/><br/>- Your contact holds some enmity towards you, you owe him a debt, or his help will cost you<br/>- Reaching your contact will be inconvenient or dangerous<br/>- You contact can\u2019t directly help you, but he can at least point you in the right direction<br/><br/>*On a miss, choose one from the list, and the situation will be worse than you expected when you reach your contact.<br/><br/>When you work with your contact to solve your problems, you may resolve the Bond and mark XP as usual, or you may keep the Bond. If you wish to use an established contact to seek help from, add +Bond to the roll.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438589/#Comment_438589" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-20T20:10:21+00:00" title="September 20, 2014  8:10PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
