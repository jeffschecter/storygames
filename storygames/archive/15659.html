Walton and Hans C-O on the tweeters, I've resolved to try, yet again, to convince myself to play Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>See, in the past, I've always read the book and been discouraged... for some reason. See, I love Burning Wheel, but my BW games always die under their own weight (rules-weight, that is).<br/><br/>So you'd think the "rules light" Burning Wheel would be perfect for me and my group, but I always get turned off. The GM's Turn and the highly abstracted conflict system always throw me: "why would I want to design missions for my players?" What's the deal with checks?<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm trying to say is: "look, I know I should like this game, but I get discouraged by the details. everyone tells me 'try it, you'll like it!' but that won't work - my problem isn't with the conceit, it's with a disbelief that the mechanics support the conceit."<br/><br/>So... Convince me?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354986/#Comment_354986" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T12:14:08+00:00" title="January 19, 2012 12:14PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Give it a shot by running it as a play-by-forum.

Mouse Guard is highly structured and uses meta rules to help drive that structure. <br/><br/>I suspect you would enjoy the majority of Mouse Guard but then it becomes a question of, does disliking part of the game, mean giving up on all of it? I can't answer that as it is a personal and subjective question. <br/><br/>I can try flipping things around. Let me tell you why you shouldn't like Mouse Guard:<br/><br/>- Play is broken down into highly structure turns. And on those turns, you have strong limits on what you can do. These limits are based on Mouse Guard's theme, but they push you in a very specific direction. During the GM Turn, you are on a mission, time is of the essence, and you don't have time to recover from harmful conditions or use certain time consuming skills. <br/><br/>- Play is meta. You make choices outside of your character. The more you play your character against themselves during the mission, the more checks your earn, which gives you more scenes during the Player Turn. Do you sacrifice the good of the mission for your own self interests? <br/><br/>- Play is explicit. You tell everyone what you want out of the game, and you're rewarded for playing towards those wants. You decide how you want to roleplay, so these mechanics are by no means restrictive but they encourage you to communicate to everyone else what you want in the game.<br/><br/>- Play is driven heavily by rewards. Mathematically, if you want a chance to succeed at most skills, you need help. Which works great for the teamwork aspect of the game. Mathematically, if you want a good chance to succeed, you need to spend the rewards you earn or endanger your nature. Which drives you to tell us what you care about and reinforces the game's themes. <br/><br/>- Play is judgmental. Your fellow players judge your play and give you rewards. This in my experience helps bring everyone together but can make some people uncomfortable. <br/><br/>- Play is tactical. Mastering the game will make you more likely to succeed. I do feel they strike a good balance between experience and inexperienced play. The worst player can still beat the best player. Luck helps mitigate skill. But tactical skill is still rewarded and present.<br/><br/>Does this turn you off? <br/><br/>If so, how much?<br/><br/>Also keep in mind, there are plenty of things I think I like but then dislike when I actually do them. And things I think I dislike and am ok with or even enjoy in practice. Take everything with a grain of salt and always judge for yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355010/#Comment_355010" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T13:16:11+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  1:16PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW if you want "rules light" Burning Wheel, that's already in BW -- it's the hub rules.

It plays very differently - it reminds me of movies like Jurassic Park or Indiana Jones, where there are these brief respites from the action, punctuated by rollercoaster-like sequences of action where the protagonists are barely holding on.<br/><br/>As the GM, you need to be willing to grab the reins and do that, otherwise the GM's turn doesn't work.  The fact that the party is based around a particular concept gives you some additional authority here, which is that you can more or less assume that they're going to respond to patrol responsibilities.<br/><br/>I suppose it's a bit like the way a D&amp;D DM running a linear campaign can assume the players will play along with 'adventure this way' cues, cavemouths and NPCs bearing clues.<br/><br/>Checks are a bit like trouble-causing instincts from BW, except instead of Fate points they each a longer rest between GM turns.  A mutually helpful three or four-mouse patrol potentially has access to a lot of helping dice, so players deliberately flirting with failure is part of the game.<br/><br/>I found the GM's turn challenging; for whatever reason we found ourselves blazing through turns quite quickly (having only me and two players might have had something to do with it), and I found it clashed with my sense of the narrative's rhythm.  At one point, the mice (who had just failed horribly and wound up with all conditions) had just found somewhere to hide - they were lost in the forest, in winter, hiding in a tree.  Things were about as bad as they could be, both narratively and mechanically, and now it was my turn again.<br/><br/>In hindsight, I had more options than I realized - I could have accelerated the time and taken them far away from that spot, declared the mission a failure and tell them it took them a month to find their way back home and let the NPC agenda advance correspondingly, then give them a new mission to suit.<br/><br/>But yeah, if you don't believe the mechanics support the conceit, you either need to play or set the game aside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355014/#Comment_355014" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T13:40:36+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  1:40PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about this: After running dozens of sessions and having written a very lengthy hack of MG that's due to be published, I can confirm that the mechanics support the conceit. Is that enough reassurance?<br/><br/>It's also possible that your understanding of the MG conceit isn't correct. It's a game about a group of competent professionals committed to completing a mission, with breaks in the action where we get to see what those professionals do on their own time. A well-run game of MG will play up the tension between doing the job, handling your own responsibilities, and a fundamental nature that is at odds with both those things. MG is all about that three-way tension, and everything in the game supports that.<br/><br/>The abstracted conflict system does a couple things. One, it promotes and facilitates team play. MG is about the <b>team</b> doing the <b>job</b>. It isn't a toolbox game where characters care about whatever they care about, and it certainly does not handle non-team, non-mission play especially well. Two, it provides the game's only opportunity for compromise and halfway victories. In all other cases, either you've succeeded, you've succeeded at a cost, or you've complicated your job by having to deal with a whole new situation. The conflict system gets your team involved, and allows for gray outcomes.<br/><br/>Is there anything else about the mechanics that you're feeling especially skeptical about? Is it just the turn structure and the conflict system?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355028/#Comment_355028" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T15:08:07+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  3:08PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2012 3:08PM by J_Walton.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite> it certainly does not handle non-team, non-mission play especially well.</blockquote>\nActually, we're playing a 1-on-1 solo "black ops" MG hack right now and it works pretty well, but the underlying core of team-based missions is important even when we defy it.  You still feel its presence there, so John's character has started thinking about recruiting a local guide and maybe even forming a team for missions in which he wasn't explicitly assigned one.  We just discussed adding a new mechanic where the PC has the option to report in at the beginning of every session (kinda like the existing session recap guidelines), in which case, he gets explicit orders (a new mission).  Otherwise, he has to continue doing his job in the field to the best of his understanding and judgment. So... both the team and mission aspects are not 100% necessary all the time, but MG definitely isn't built -- by default -- to be a sandbox game, but more of a mix between strongly directed portions and more open-ended sections (and the open-ended sections aren't all just in the Player Turn).  It could probably be a sandbox game with a little work, I think, but that's not in its nature (pun maybe intended). It actually reminds me a lot of Bliss Stage, in this respect, which also has something like Player/GM Turns and an authority figure that you sometimes openly or secretly defy. Gwendolyn sometimes tells the patrol to do things they decide not to do, right? Or that become immaterial once other events supercede them? That definitely happens in my games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355030/#Comment_355030" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T15:12:50+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  3:12PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one thing that sometimes gets missed in MG planning: the GM doesn't decide how the players tackle the obstacles they plan.  The GM can offer some suggestions about what skills or traits might be appropriate, but figuring out how to deal with obstacles can actually be very open-ended.  The obstacle is, like, "The bridge has washed out, how are you going to make it to Sprucetuck now?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355033/#Comment_355033" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T15:31:29+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  3:31PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to say a lot of what others have said, but I just want to emphasize, if you look at something, and you don't think you'll like it, maybe you will, or maybe you won't, but it's probably a better bet of your limited time on this fine green globe to roll the dice with something that you are absolutely gaga over and cannot wait FIVE MORE SECONDS to play, you want to play it RIGHT NOW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355034/#Comment_355034" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T15:39:47+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  3:39PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>it's probably a better bet of your limited time on this fine green globe to roll the dice with something that you are absolutely gaga over and cannot wait FIVE MORE SECONDS to play, you want to play it RIGHT NOW.</blockquote>\nOooh, Oooh, that's me!

After a year of curiosity, I recently had the chance to play Mouseguard at Dreamation.  I wanted to try Burning Wheel, and was intrigued by the art work and clever setting.  The other players in my session were all good guys, veterans, and the GM was likeable and seemed reasonably competent to my clueless self.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying the game did not do it for me.  It was a disappointment, especially because I really wanted to like it.  Jenskot's analysis helped me understand why the game just did not click for me.  The meta-gaming aspects rubbed me the wrong way and the structure of play just struck me as overly clunky.   Mind you I did have fun, but I had hoped for more and found the whole experience more frustrating than fun.  Obviously, that's just my experience, and I encourage others to try and relish what is a good game.  It just wasn't for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
