Traveler gets into some kind trouble with the environment (e.g. gets lost, breaks leg, runs out of water, etc.). Stranger arrives and helps traveler. Traveler reaches somewhere more civilized. Traveler discovers stranger who helped him/her was ghost of someone who died many years ago. A popular variation of this kind of tale is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_hitchhiker" rel="nofollow">phantom hitchhiker</a>.<br/><br/>Another important thing about some ghost stories is the notion of why the ghost is haunting. There was a certain logic about why the ghost manifests, what it does when manifesting, and who it targets. Often this logic is used to provide a way to banish the ghost. The game <i>Chill</i> did an OK job of spelling this out. The TV series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_%28TV_series%29" rel="nofollow">Supernatural</a> is pretty much based on this concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263804/#Comment_263804" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T19:32:08+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  7:32PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            May I suggest <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/henry_james/turn_screw/" rel="nofollow">The Turn of the Screw</a>, by Henry James and <a href="http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/ghost-stories-hardy.html" rel="nofollow">The Withered Arm</a>, by Thomas Hardy?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263809/#Comment_263809" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T20:05:01+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  8:05PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2010 8:07PM by Nameless.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow</a><br/>\n<br/>\nClassic American ghost story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263817/#Comment_263817" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T21:28:43+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  9:28PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I actually have a scholarly interest in this, so here's my personal Top Ten list:<br><br>10.

The first is to set the tone early - speak quietly, dim the lights, maybe even decorate the room a little with skulls, candleabra etc. But if you do this even the best scares are bound to come across as fairly predictable and contrived. The other way is to run the game in a casual setting, allow for lots of OOC crosstalk, and sneak up on them with the oogie-boogies. This latter, maybe more ambitious approach was the one I eventually settled on, and it worked well enough that I was able to sustain the Chronicle for what is a long time for me, but it was still hit-and-miss - in many of the scenes that I thought would terrify folks, either somebody got the giggles or they all just wanted to break into combat.<br/><br/>It might have been unduly difficult for me because I had so many people (fifteen at one point) involved in the game, all with very vividly realized characters. I need to try to run a Ghost Story game with just three or four people - I think it'd be a lot easier under those conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263896/#Comment_263896" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T10:39:50+00:00" title="March 24, 2010 10:39AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoy everything in <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.</i> The general formula of ghost stories I have read seem to follow the pattern: Normal people encounter seemingly normal circumstances with subtle cues that are not meaningful at the moment.

What made it scary was a reveal. The basics were: we were in a remote place. As always, the run had all gone to hell, this time because the target had been killed in a grizzly way before we got there. Information he had was missing, so, assuming the killer had it, we tracked him. After a few days of looking, the killer turned out to be his best friend, who had been mutated into something Very Bad in a really nasty way. Wouldn't want it to happen to you. After a few more days, and a few more mutated people, we figured out what was causing the mutations: the water supply. The same water supply we'd been drinking out of for a week or so. Watching the players move from "if I'm not careful, something of this kind may happen to me" to "holy crap! something of this kind <i>is</i> happening to me" was really creepy. Essentially, the horror was the realization that this Bad Thing had <i>already happened</i>, and now we were just waiting for it to get worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263974/#Comment_263974" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T21:57:37+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  9:57PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>I enjoy everything in<i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.</i>The general formula of ghost stories I have read seem to follow the pattern: Normal people encounter seemingly normal circumstances with subtle cues that are not meaningful at the moment.

It seem like it'd be awfully difficult to game this sort of a story, though, since the scariness would all be retrospective. Any ideas about how you might make it work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263991/#Comment_263991" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T04:03:27+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  4:03AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2010 4:04AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making it its own game would be the most boring thing in the world, but you could do it easily as a one-shot or scenario with Unknown Armies or even something like D&amp;D. PCs find village. Village is full of people who are tormented by nearby orcs, claims that their dead were stolen and eaten by the orcs. Could the PCs please retrieve them so they could give them a proper burial? The PCs go, kill the orcs, retrieve the skulls and bones of the dead, return and find the village has been burned to the ground for years and the bones belong to the villagers who asked them to retrieve them, dun dun dunnn. Or something like in Unknown Armies where someone is asking the PCs to act as their agent to retrieve an item or get their revenge. After this is completed the individual doesn't meet them at the agreed upon place. They do research, find the person was dead and the act of revenge or item was significant to them and their death, dun dun dunn.<br/><br/>Of course this relies on the PCs not doing any research that would reveal their dead/supernatural nature in the first plact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264063/#Comment_264063" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T12:20:36+00:00" title="March 25, 2010 12:20PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to suggest M R James too. I'll pull out something additional to what Steve said: he's very good at using senses other than sight to suggest something otherworldly and perilous. This automatically is scarier because the thing is experienced vividly but not seen clearly as the rational mind likes.<br/><br/>H P Lovecraft did an essay on horror in literature which I seem to recall had some useful pointers. I know it's in the 3-volume story collection I have.<br/><br/>William Hope Hodgson's 'Carnacki the Ghost-Finder' series is a different beast, dressed up with its own pseudo-occultism, but also describing unnatural manifestations quite well. Though quite often resolved by deus ex machina.<br/><br/>I think the only common formula for how ghost stories work is that they convey to the reader a disruption to the natural order of how things are, in a way that has enough force to generate corresponding emotions if just for a moment. So a superficial example is that a character has been interacting in the story and it turns out they've been dead all along. Put that way it sounds very ho hum, but if the reader has been lulled, successfully, into a certain track of how things are and drawn into the mundane aspect of the story, then that disjunction can hit home. If a figure is observed at a window, and there's all sorts of plausible speculation as to who it might be, and then you find it's drawn together of the dust of the house that hasn't been swept for thirty years, there can be that fleeting sense of unearthliness. I suppose you can also do it as a sudden, campfire-style shock. And I suppose you can also do it by drawing on perfectly reasonable fears of things that could easily happen but generally don't, like going to close the curtains at night and seeing a stranger's face looking in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264148/#Comment_264148" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T08:53:29+00:00" title="March 26, 2010  8:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2010 8:55AM by lordgoon.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=54302{1}8" rel="nofollow">Here's </a> <a href="null" rel="nofollow"></a> somethng else that might be worth a look.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
