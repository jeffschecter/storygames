In the Lords of the Rings example, it's the "unbeknowst to him..." bits. <br/><br/>Ideally, a GM could read your paragraph, and <i>with no other prep</i> (except for maybe daydreaming some colourful descriptions, but that's always optional) play out an adventure (or even an epic tale).<br/><br/>I'd say the James's (the first one) and Adam's come closest to that, out of the offerings so far. They're pretty self-contained. Star Wars/King Arthur is almost there!<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird's situation (though it draws a bit on the character writeups, as well, so maybe it's not as concise...) is a good example, I think. (Not strictly fantasy, but close enough!)<br/><br/>The ideal starting stituation gives us a clear idea of what might happen next, and what the protagonists might do about it, what choices they might face. <br/><br/>I chose the Lords of the Rings example for this reason: it's pretty short. But if I am a PC in this story, I know what I need to do: run, find safety, figure out why this thing is desirable, and then what to do with it - protect it, hide it, destroy it? If I am a GM of some variety, I also know what's going to happen. The Black Riders are coming; if they get the Ring, the Dark Lord will threaten the entire world. Kind of like a Front in AW.<br/><br/>I can thereby generate almost the entire plot of the Lord of the Rings, even if I've never heard of the book.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450368/#Comment_450368" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T06:23:43+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  6:23AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's this sword.

Wild stuff.<br/></blockquote>\nThanks! It worked wonders for a while on the last Anima campaign I GMed and finished. I made the rest more or less a sandbox but managed poorly the fronts. I made them too big and they moved too slow through the world in respect to the player's actions.<br/><br/>Basically the BBEG used a magic contract in the party to turn them into their mindless servants (it was only later that they figured out it had been for 5 years. They were sent with those uniforms to a frontier to start a war, acted the kidnapping of the princess, but didn't killed her. Instead the princess managed to remove the contract magic and set them loose to stir things around and find out who was the BBEG behind this, following them incognito.<br/><br/>The father of the princess eventually met the party at the house of the prominent nobleman, where other two rulers reunited to finally try to get what was going on and if any of them was behind it (everyone was on suspicion up until now for several reasons) It was a nice tense scene, PCs still weren't sure if they had killed the princess or not. The king analyzed the head and found out it was the work of her daughter, but couldn't guess why her daughter had feigned her death. So, he kept the bounty on their head but took steps to make sure they didn't got caught so easily by their men.<br/><br/>Some bounty hunters on their tracks and assassins here and there held some more information, but eventually the players found an old temple of a cult related to the BBEG of the previous campaign, now long defeated. There they took a turn that changed the entire game: they decided to stay in that town and create a cult of their own based on the old one. They ended up convincing the entire town into their cult and turning the town into a trap for the forces against them. Of course, these were bigger than expected, so they ended up leading their faithful in a quest to find the legendary city of the ancient humans.<br/><br/>When they got there, we played a sort of flashback with the players as the former kings of the ancient human nations, but each one got in secret a card with an agenda. It was things like "anything goes as long as your people survive" "Lives don't matter, but knowledge has to be saved" "Diplomacy is the only solution" "Whatever goes must be in your terms or you're out", and such,  I can't remember all. I let players come up with whatever technomagical doomsday devices they could think of and we wrote them in cards and handed out to everyone randomly. <br/><br/>Then we roleplayed the kings through an invasion of beings from another dimension whose technology and nature surpassed the weapons they had now. After barely resisting a first wave they were sent an ultimatum and had a video conference to come up with a plan. It was then that cards with the secret agendas came into play and created one of the best scenes we had ever played. I had the diplomatic solution, so I ended making a treaty with the aliens that limited the remaining humans into a reservation, erased their memories and limited their technology to medieval levels with some basic magic and genetic engineered beasts which survived from the great war.<br/><br/>We got to narrate the epilogues for every king. My character ended up making a secret group to control the levels of technology, power and the amount of humans, to keep them from being a threat to the aliens, which let us live in exchange. Other king chose to protect the technology, another kept a DNA database of their people to help them survive the war. One more designed weapons to kill the aliens, which ended lost through the setting as legendary swords of black steel. And then the last king hide his floating city in a pocket dimension and became the BBEG from the previous campaign, who was bent on inflicting pain and bringing the humanity into conflict to make them stronger so they could eventually evolve and rise again to fight the aliens.<br/><br/>We went then back to the main campaign with the original characters, seeing all this as an holovideo left by the BBEG in his city, and then the guy himself came in to face the PCs and challenge them. If they wanted to try and make the final fight against the aliens, they had to go through him and the ancient police left by the other king, a couple of A.I.s that were now the gods of the setting.<br/><br/>That was more or less how the background of the setting ended up being, though a big chunk of it was made through play instead of being prepped.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450430/#Comment_450430" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T21:06:34+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  9:06PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amended with some more background info:\n<blockquote>You're the entourage of the royal heir (fellow young nobles, bodyguard, tutor, fencing instructor, etc.), summering at a remote castle far from the capital.

If you wake up, it's all sorts of bad news for them, but maybe for you too, as escaping the catacombs could be a sort of dungeon crawl.  <br/><br/>Every time your party clears a safe space in the dungeon, you can return to the dreamworld (via some ilithid device the catacombs are filled with) to use it to communicate with people at distance, exchange spells, and otherwise better equip yourself to fight the mindflayers in the real world and the dreamworld.  Maybe spells you learn in the dreamworld work in the real world too?  Or maybe, like uploads in the Matrix, spells are something that originates from the real world but is only useful in the dreamworld; the missions in the dreamworld would then have to be about something else, a la "The One" arc.<br/><br/>In the dreamworld, certain dreaming mindflayers keep an eye on things, eliminating anomalies and attempts to wake people up.

It gets them asking questions! Why am I here? Who arranged this meeting? Are there enough chairs? Are there any newspapers/magazines? Who is the receptionist?<br/><br/>If they are there willingly, they should be based on the establishing questions they asked, they'll be on their best behaviour which should reduce the chance of "I set fire to the newspapers!" and other such shenanigans.<br/><br/>It also gives them a chance to interact with each other idly. Once some of the details have been established you let them wait a little bit. Player A may ask Player B "So are you here for the Buskins job too?" Meanwhile Player C is brooding in the dark corner observing the others, and Player D is hitting on the receptionist.

The party can try to escape to retrieve reinforcements, help the underground loyalist resistance, try to negotiate peaceful terms, or even sneak in and rescue the captured queen.<br/><br/><b>Predators Become Prey</b><br/>Each of the characters awakes in some state of immediate emergency - they're falling from the sky, they're underwater, they're inside of a pitch black cave, whatever - and don't remember how they got there. Once they get out of their predicament, they're in a strange and alien wilderness completely unknown to them. They're each of their clan's greatest warriors that have been taken by a super-predator race, brought to this isolated island, and must band together to kill off their hunters.<br/><br/><b>Here, take this!</b><br/>The party is a group of friends, colleagues, or family members all resting or cajoling in the same place (a tavern, their workshop, their house, whatever). A wall bursts open, followed by an obviously epic hero (a powerful mage, mighty warrior, infamous assassin, the Kool Aid man, you get the idea). The hero is mortally wounded, clutching at her bloodied chest. She implores the group to take the McGuffin as far from here as possible, for the forces of evil are hot on her trail! Nice thing about this one is the item/hero/forces of evil aren't inherently any of those things, it could amount to little more than wizards squabbling between their demonic familiars, or it could actually be the thing that saves the world. <br/><br/>I'll try to come up with a few more if you like these. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hegar" title="Hegar"><img alt="Hegar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/540/nQ9CR7M800M2Y.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hegar">Hegar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450626/#Comment_450626" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-14T04:10:30+00:00" title="January 14, 2016  4:10AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You and your companions performed many valiant deeds before you died, or so said the dark god who came to visit you in the endless fields of the afterlife.

I didn't have anything in particular in mind, I just wanted to leave open the possibility that the dark god was leaving out some details, or lying. Maybe not though.
