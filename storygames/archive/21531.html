I said\n<blockquote>\u201cIn most life contexts, believing written rules and procedures is of dubious value. When you enter a new community, you\u2019re usually better to follow what others do rather than what the rules say you should do. The real rules \u2014 those that most people follow in practice \u2014 are unlikely to be exactly those that are written down.\u201d</blockquote>\nto which he replied\n<blockquote>\u201cWhich is why I find it so aggravating that that \u201cfollow the written rules of a game\u201d is such a hard sell. People can get no-rules everywhere else, why demand no-rules here, too?\u201d</blockquote>\nIn other words, Dan is asking why people don\u2019t take rpg play as a chance to enter a well-defined magic circle \u2014 to play, for a change, in an environment defined by rules.<br/><br/>I think there are several reasons in play, and I've tried to capture them in <a href="https://mhuthulan.mediumquality.uk/2018/03/11/why-do-rpg-players-ignore-rules/" rel="nofollow">a blog post</a>.<br/><br/>Anyone think I've missed any?

Or fudge it so that we do meet the requirements?"<br/><br/>I think this is just typical human behaviour when any social group engages with a set of pre-written rules for their own enjoyment: the rules of football are hardly adhered to at all in a friendly kick about in the park, except for the most fundamental requirements. On the other hand, I'm sure I'd be really annoyed if I sat down to a boardgame and we didn't play by the rules as written, so I guess it also depends on where your tolerances lie.<br/><br/>I expect the rules of an RPG to be followed pretty closely, unless there is a clearly compelling reason not to, such as the afore-mentioned time pressure or, the other popular one, constraints imposed by the medium, e.g. playing online as opposed to playing face-to-face. This is all conscious choice rather than 'forgetting' though; I would associate the latter with rules that don't have an obvious purpose, are tangential to the other mechanics or seem to run counter to the tone of the game. The rules I forget most often are Tension in Dead of Night and conflict weighting in Hot War, both systems I love to bits, but when I'm in a hurry, those are the rules I'm most likely to forget to explain to new players or just forget to implement them after explaining them, They don't <i>directly</i> impact the game, in most cases, so if I forget them, it doesn't fundamentally change the game, it just means some opportunities get missed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470804/#Comment_470804" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T16:12:24+00:00" title="March 19, 2018  4:12PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2018 4:14PM by Rafu.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The truism is, we as a subculture have trained ourselves into <i>not</i> following rules to the letter over the whole history of this hobby (and a niche of a niche amongst us have recently re-trained ourselves into doing the opposite, but that's besides the point).<br/><br/>The actual question is, of course, why did we? To which the answer is, most likely, a combination of multiple factors, including the influence of real life and our broader culture/s (it is my general subjective experience that most people in most contexts do not strictly follow rules they are not rigidly bound to by restricted technical affordances).<br/><br/>However, I submit my opinion that one of those multiple factors at least is <b>poor design</b>. I maintain that, over the history of RPGs, badly designed rules (and/or arguably badly <i>explained</i> rules) have been commonplace, to the point of perhaps being in the majority. To most participants in the role-playing subculture, then, oral transmission of replacement (better?) rules has been the only option - even when those replacement rules have often been reductive, including referee absolutism and other underwhelming solutions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470805/#Comment_470805" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T16:31:41+00:00" title="March 19, 2018  4:31PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

It creates the unique challenges and opportunities of this particular game.  "This game is, among other things, a foot dexterity challenge."  You can quickly decide whether you're into that or not.<br/><br/>In chess, the value of "you can only move each piece in a certain way" is immediately obvious, creating its own challenges and opportunities, related to spatial envisioning and anticipation.  Maybe you want to do that, maybe you don't.<br/><br/>A lot of RPG rules fall into this category of "obviously valuable", but a lot of other ones don't.  A rule might be cool on its own merits but have nothing to do with why people are playing the game.  Or it might be a vital part of the game but not be obvious about how or why.  Or it might be merely functional and interchangeable with other options from other games which the players like better (maybe because they <i>are</i> better, or maybe just due to simple familiarity).<br/><br/>I like to try out new RPGs and learn what unique things they have to offer, as written.  But when I'm not on that mission, and am just looking to have fun with my friends in the moment?  The value of your rule had better be immediately apparent, <i>cuz I can do just fine without it.<br/></i><br/>That last point is what separates RPGs from board games and card games.  Going on adventures in your imagination is inherently fun, even without rules, in a way that pushing cards around a table is not.  If you sit down to play a card game, you're a captive of its rules for as long as you're playing, so you'd better either try your best to get the most out of them, or decide conclusively that they're not for you.  In an RPG, there's no such incentive.  You can ignore or forget every rule and still be roleplaying, possibly even having a great time.  That may not be what you want to do, but it is at least possible, and if that's what the other players want, you may find yourself going along with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470818/#Comment_470818" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T20:22:57+00:00" title="March 19, 2018  8:22PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't there always a dynamic relationship between the rules-as-written, the rules-as-orally-transmitted, and the rules-we-play-by?  Like in Judaism.  You have to know how to interpret the ambiguities in the written rules, and then how to adapt them to your group's situation. <br/><br/>At least in the old days, there was sort of a fantasy heartbreaker lifecycle where a GM would start with a favorite ruleset, play the hell out of it, reskin it, house rule it, the houserules developed houserules of their own, and eventually the GM would create a reference document for all the houserules and special cases. Then you'd add art and an essay explaining what roleplaying games are, and you'd have a new fantasy heartbreaker.<br/><br/>I remember the first time I saw that post in Anyway by Vincent Baker where he pointed out that some RPG's are dramatically more fun when you follow the rules strictly, and some aren't.

Because it turns out the goals \u2013 the actual reasons for playing the game \u2013 are what\u2019s important to most players, not the task of implementing the specifics of a ruleset. As long as you\u2019re following the agreed-upon goals, people are going to have fun (which is generally the unspoken meta-goal).<br/><br/>I like <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg%E2%80%99s">@David_Berg\u2019s</a> description.

I think it's a question worth asking whether so many games really have "bad" rules that require changing, or if they just have rules that people think they're above following. I think Ron Edwards started questioning that supposition by trying to suss out the difference between the stated goals of a text and the experience the rules created (System Matters and the three CA essays); the OSR movement did it too, and revitalized what was at one point a rather maligned rules set/play style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470833/#Comment_470833" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T11:01:13+00:00" title="March 20, 2018 11:01AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Role-playing Games are creative and are generally played by creative people.<br/><br/>The urge to tinker is therefore strong and often leads to houserules - be that actually new rules or changing or ignoring existing published rules. Some people prefer the established and 'safe' structure of strong rulesets ('safe' as in, 'these have been playtested and Iknow they work'), others prefer the open form of improvisation.

Like, sure, there may not be a rule for this exact situation, but it's not hard to extrapolate from the existing ruleset how it should apply. In our 5E game, when <a href="/forums/profile/DBB">@DBB</a> 's character was in a monster's stomach, the Paladin jumped in to save her, and did so by lighting up some incense to make the monster cough them both up. The GM handled the incense lighting with a Con save. Obviously not something the rules could have predicted, but a totally within-the-rules-framework solution.<br/><br/>What I find when I play games with GMs who frustrate me is that they very often don't even understand the point of the game... which gets back to <a href="/forums/profile/DBB">@DBB</a> 's comment about the goal being most important. A good example would be trying to play Burning Wheel with a GM who refuses to set binary stakes before each skill roll: that isn't just against the rules, it undermines a whole lot of Luke's entire purpose in how he constructed the ruleset. Players need to know exactly what's at stake on each roll so they can decide what resources to bring to bear. If the GM can decide post-facto what happens, that all goes out the window. Also, without a hard and fast difficulty number, many GMs will be tempted to go with a "good enough" approach, which actually sucks.<br/><br/>What I mean by the "good enough" approach (and here we're getting into "Spicy Dice Roll" territory) is that, if the Obstacle really should be 5, but someone rolls 4 successes, the sloppy GM will often let them get what they want, or part of what they want. (Obviously this sort of compromise is fine in, e.g., an AW engine game where a mixed result is part of the rules.) I often see this with 13's or 14's on skill rolls in 5E. Motherfucker, the DC is 15, so that 14 should be treated exactly like a 1.<br/><br/>(To be fair, there are more principled ways to handle that specific issue: many GMs do in fact give you a partial result if you're within 5 of the target, particularly on knowledge checks. This isn't terrible, but I do wish they'd be up front about it.)<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The other thing Yukamichi's comment brings up, for me, is the eternal question of <i>when</i> it's okay to bring in Rule Zero. A whole lot of the power tripping aspect comes when you find out <i>in the middle of a game</i> that something is different than how it's printed in the book.

You have to remember that role playing games started with very few rules and the idea that the GM would rule on what is or isnt possible and what your chances were.   Initially there were just wargaming rules adapted to handling different characters and they bolted on whatever else was needed like magic or undead creatures or whatever else your group came up with.  The thing is whoever was running the game was essentially designing it as they went by what their rulings created for the game.   Everyone was creating their own rules as they went and when some rulebook came out that added rules x, y and z sometimes you didnt like them or found they conflicted with how you've already been doing it so you ignored what the rulebooks stated.   <br/><br/>Of course games have changed since then and many are much more complete in terms of how the rules handle any possible situation that could come up in play.   Even with the complete physics engine type systems creating the game as you went still remained an integral part of play in deciding what types of characters were in the game, what situations they faced and maybe most importantly what restrictions we were going to put on the moral actions the character would be allowed to take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470838/#Comment_470838" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T16:53:00+00:00" title="March 20, 2018  4:53PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2018 4:55PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might not surprise you that this is hardly a new conversation topic.<br/><br/>Here's a good (and short) article on the topic by Chris Chinn from 2008:<br/><br/><a href="https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2008/06/07/rule-zero/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2008/06/07/rule-zero/</a><br/><br/>He brings up the important distinction of who is the "you" in the sentence "you may change the rules if you don't like them".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470843/#Comment_470843" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T19:53:28+00:00" title="March 20, 2018  7:53PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2018 8:05PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want a diagram of RPGs throughout time, showing the overlap of "rulings, not rules" as (a) the official, correct approach as per the published materials, (b) the designers' expectation, and (c) the play culture of those who actually play the game.\n<ul><li>When (c) lines up with (a) or (b), we have no inherent problem, just maybe some gaps that need filling in, and a really strong need for good judgment.

The human brain can't process a whole book of data in an hour to play a complete game and at most we will probably spend half an hour as players to learn the rules of a game. So, what our brains do? They use past experiences to fill the gaps. No wonder why many D&amp;D players ended up playing VtM like it was the same deal with a different way of rolling dice.<br/><br/>Then we have the communicational problems: even if we understand both the spirit, meaning and applications of a rule, explaining it properly to others requires an effort in both finding clear terms to express it and don't think something is "too obvious" to be explained. That's one of the most recursive mistakes of designers and GM's: we have interiorized rules and concepts in such a way that we end up thinking everyone else knows what we're talking about, so we end up forgetting to explain them.<br/><br/>This is specially true for behaviors, gestures and ritual phrases we use to trigger procedures and ellicit emotions in other players. We had to wait until Archipielago to see these turned into part of the rulebook. Of course, now it's such an obvious thing, but if you remember how confused you were the first time you saw people playing a RPG, then you will get an idea of what I'm referring to here.<br/><br/>On top of that, when we reduce the RPG experience to a minimum common denominator, what we've got is that we get together to make up a fictional world where some things happen, or at least that's where our expectations are. To fulfill those expectations all we need to do is make things happen, which can be done by completely ignoring the rules! Give your brain an easier way to do things and it will go down that path everytime it gets frustrated or distracted.<br/><br/>It's not like these things can't be fought. Being clearer and a bit more rigid about the core rules of the game helps, by stating most of those really helpful advice to play the game as actual rules. People will still ignore those if they want, but will definitely feel less sure about doing things their way instead of trying the designer's way for once. <br/><br/>Next you will need to be as clear and concise as you can about those rules, think of what you're forgetting to explain, what you have already interiorized in order to play this game and that important new focus you're applying to your game that makes it work. If you forget to explain that people will simply use their own experience to fill the gaps and you can bet it will not always be the same as yours.<br/><br/>Actual play descriptions end up being the best vehicle to explain a game, after playing it with someone who already knows the system. Examples help a lot, but will not suffice if whatever the designer has interiorized isn't described. It's somewhat frustrating that the same marvellous devices that allow us to experience this wonderful unlimited world of fiction -our minds- also hinder us when we try to convey the rules and procedures used to reach the best form for this experience. Words and other tools are there to help us, but we've got to be really careful about how we use them, when, where and what sort of things we're forgetting to explain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470939/#Comment_470939" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T03:32:33+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  3:32AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of notes:\n<ul>\n<li>As stated by <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, this isn't a new conversation at all, and <a href="/forums/profile/bankuei">@bankuei</a> does have a series of articles, starting <a href="https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/the-roots-of-the-big-problems/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, that talk about it at length.

That they can't really "play a different game" because they always end up playing pretty much the same game. They can reskin ("now we are astronauts") but they can't change the game ("now, the GM must declare difficulty and stakes before the roll").<br/><br/>That frustrates some people. People who really want to play a variety of different games and have different experiences, or who just want to change something about how their default group habitually plays.<br/><br/>I think it particularly affects people who tend to play rather than GM (or play GMless), who aren't very socially adept, and are low status within the group they're playing with. Under those conditions, it's not realistic for them to change how the group plays forever, but it would seem fair that they get to play how they want <i>some</i> of the time.

For someone with knowledge of how a game is supposed to work, play can break down completely if what you care about is something other players might not even notice. "The GM is required to set stakes and difficulty before rolling" is actually a magnificent example: I deeply care about that sort of thing, and if it's in the game text, the GM better do it. Anyone who doesn't GM, or doesn't understand the implications of such a rule, might just not care, so to them, ignoring that rule does not cause the activity to break down, but to a high information player, it does cause play to break down, because the high information player has a different concept of what the point of the game actually is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471027/#Comment_471027" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-23T04:49:05+00:00" title="March 23, 2018  4:49AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point.

Some systems bank on this take and make allowances for it, but even when I am running a game that defines the play experience pretty strictly like Pathfinder, I will find moments that go beyond what is conveniently handled by the rules and go beyond it.<br/><br/>Above there is some talk about systems mattering. One of the metrics I internally assign to systems in their "play experience coverage". I call systems like Fate and PbtA 50% systems, whereas I think of games like Pathfinder as 90% systems. More is not necessarily better, but they way I approach a system differs by the coverage the system provides.<br/><br/>And I do value "high coverage" systems for providing expectations of a stable shared experience. But I don't think of any systems as being "100% coverage".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471089/#Comment_471089" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-24T19:43:37+00:00" title="March 24, 2018  7:43PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One reason that I don't think had been covered in this thread is, 'because I think this better reflects reality/the genre.'<br/><br/>This is quite common in wargaming. I, for example, do not think that many rules properly model the effectiveness of the British OQF 2-pdr AT gun and usually have to 'tweak' the penetration tables to better reflect its armour-piercing qualities.<br/><br/>In RPGs this might cover a variety of situations. In RQ 2nd edition I did not like the way that the existing Strike Rank rules reflected the speed of melee weapons. Consequently, I altered them. In my ongoing GURPS Call of Cthulhu conversion I was not happy with the way that existing GURPS Fright Check rules modelled the classic Lovecraftian slow descent into madness, so I revised both the tables and the 'madness' disadvantages that the PC picks up.<br/><br/>How much is this simple tinkering with rules and how much is 'I know better' hubris? Does it matter? The end result is a game that I am happier with and hopefully my enthusiasm will persuade other players that it is better.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471091/#Comment_471091" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-24T22:31:37+00:00" title="March 24, 2018 10:31PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call, <a href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">@Sadurian</a> .

I don't think this case falls into "ignoring the rules" particularly.  Though I guess there's probably a special case of "We think we/do know better" here<br/><br/>Regarding the "crappy sandbox" - that wasn't really the point.  The point isn't that the GM necessarily provides a "Bad" experience so much as that the GM doesn't ACTUALLY change their procedures as much as they should have, because they are so accustomed to Doing Things The Way They've Always Done Them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471155/#Comment_471155" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-26T18:02:03+00:00" title="March 26, 2018  6:02PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            System (in the Forge sense): Not relevant to the discussion, as far as I see.<br/><br/>Rules: Procedural instructions for what to do in play.

I think that the best way of changing how one plays is to figure out what the goals of play are, and how the unwritten rules and procedures support or hinder the goals.

I feel like the rules/system concept is misleading (if I'm understanding it correctly, which I may not be), because it implies that both only exist in tandem, and that rules are "good" to the extent that they overlap with system. If we approach the question of why people diverge from rules from this perspective, then we're kind of assuming the conclusion based on the premises. That is, if "rules" and "system," as defined, always coexist, and a close correlation between the two is the sign of a well-designed game, then we can only say that system diverges from the rules because one or the other is deficient in some way.<br/><br/>Am I misunderstanding this?<br/><br/>If, instead, we think of a "game-as-text" as being the designed rules of a game, and "game-as-played" as being the actual human experience of playing a game, the one doesn't have to imply the other. That is, a game text can exist without being played, and a game can be played without having a text; they're two different things that can (but don't always) relate to each other.<br/><br/>If these can both have an independently valid existence, then we don't necessarily have to conclude that differences between them are reflective of a failure somewhere. We can adjust a "game-as-played" to more precisely reflect a "game-as-text" (going to the rulebook to revise our playstyle), just as we can adjust a "game-as-text" to reflect a "game-as-played" (formalizing a houserule). There's no hierarchy here.<br/><br/>To make this a clearer answer to the premise of this discussion: RPG players ignore or adjust the rules in order to make the rules ("game-as-text") conform to what they're interested in doing ("game-as-played"). Conversely, RPG players follow rules in order to match what they're doing ("game-as-played") to a third-party creative vision they're interested in exploring ("game-as-text"). And it's both possible and common for them to do both at different times during the same game, as much as it is to take one approach or the other as a consistent philosophy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471159/#Comment_471159" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-26T19:05:26+00:00" title="March 26, 2018  7:05PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Airk, I am also interested in why you think that all groups that were inspired by West marches failed.

I just said that there's no reason to believe they were successful if they don't understand how to actually change their play.  You can say "Now we're going to run a sandbox game because I read a fun thing on the Internet!" but without a good understanding of the things you actually need to change about the way you play RPGs, that won't actually produce much change. That's my point.  You are the one who took it in the "Wait, so they all failed?!" route.  I'm sure many people successfully shifted their play after reading about the West Marches  -- for a sufficiently low value of "many" here because it is, after all, the subset of RPG players (small group) who read about the West Marches (Smaller group), and thought it sounded fun (Smaller group) and decided to try it (Smaller group) and then successfully implemented it (Smaller group still.)  The sum total of my point is that that last category exists as a distinct group from "people who tried it but couldn't make it work because they were unable to shift their base assumptions about how RPGs work."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471164/#Comment_471164" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-26T20:47:19+00:00" title="March 26, 2018  8:47PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2018 9:01PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/manixur" rel="nofollow">manixur</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If, instead, we think of a "game-as-text" as being the designed rules of a game, and "game-as-played" as being the actual human experience of playing a game, the one doesn't have to imply the other.

If so, I disagree.<br/><br/>RPG products are weird to evaluate because they provide so many things other than rules and instructions.  But as for the rules and instructions themselves, if they don't demand or inspire players to use them, it's hard for me to consider them successful.<br/><br/>What other sort of game do we just adjust to fit our own vision, regardless of what's on the page?  We do that with <i>play</i>, but usually not with <i>games</i>.<br/><br/>If we evaluate an RPG text as a toybox, or toolkit for play, rather than as a game, then sure, it's only right and good to have a very incomplete overlap between text and play.  Just remove the "game-as" part from your description and I agree with everything you wrote.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I don't think this is a trivial distinction, though.  The sort of judgment you're describing ("valid", "failure", etc.) requires goals and standards, and "play" vs "game" entail very different ones IMO.<br/><br/>Relating this to "rules vs system", I guess we could say that in successful play <i>of a game</i>, our system includes <i>how</i> we use its rules, while in successful play <i>with a toy</i>, our system also includes <i>which</i> rules we use (if any).  And if we take something designed as a game and use only half its rules, we're treating it as a toy.<br/><br/>I suppose all this is largely an embellishment on two previous angles:\n<ul><li>you can ditch most rules and still be roleplaying</li>\n<li>a lot of roleplayers are used to tweaking/ignoring some rules, and bring that approach into new RPGs</li></ul>\nIt seems to me that if <i>everyone</i> thinks your text is a toybox, its rules are failing in some respect.  But if it's only RPG toybox veterans doing that, that doesn't really say anything about the rules at all.  So maybe we agree?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471175/#Comment_471175" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T04:20:25+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  4:20AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2018 4:23AM by komradebob.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David_Berg:<br/><br/>I think your post hit, at an angle, something I've thought for a long time: RPGs are not <i>games </i>for most people. <br/><br/>They're <i>Toys.</i><br/><br/>Viewed through that lens, ignoring any or even all rules makes much more sense.<br/><br/>Or, to put it another way, they're a magical document that gives you permission to <i>play</i>, by disguising <i>play</i> as a <i>game</i>.<br/><br/>Well all know that games are disreputable, but not nearly as disreputable as <i>play</i>. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471180/#Comment_471180" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T14:58:53+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  2:58PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2018 3:00PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>RPGs are not <i>games </i>for most people . . . they're a magical document that gives you permission to <i>play</i>, by disguising <i>play</i> as a <i>game</i>.</p></div></blockquote>I've never really thought about permission and what's disreputable... but observing the language around these things, I suspect you're right!

Success requires various athletic skills, including skills with a frisbee.

Naturally, I will alter or ignore some rules to bring existing published games closer to what I like to play and run.<br/><br/>I like story-telling games where players really bring their characters to life and are happy to take mechanically suboptimal choices to play out their character decisions. However, I also like a sound rules base and don't enjoy fully open systems.<br/><br/>Nobody can tell me that my choices are wrong or right, although they can agree or disagree. It would be like telling me that I'm wrong to prefer the colour orange to blue. By the same token, very few published gaming systems suit what I want exactly. The solution is to use a system that best fits my preferences and alter the rules if required.<br/><br/>Now that means that around 99% of published games are less suited to what I want to play than others. This does not make them bad games any more than the games I use are good games. They are simply the best solution for the task in hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471197/#Comment_471197" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T19:17:50+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  7:17PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>RPGs are not <i>games </i>for most people . . . they're a magical document that gives you permission to <i>play</i>, by disguising <i>play</i> as a <i>game</i>.</p></div></blockquote>I've never really thought about permission and what's disreputable... but observing the language around these things, I suspect you're right!  My friends and I refer to our roleplaying activities, even to each other, with phrases like:<br/>- game night<br/>- RPG night<br/>- play an RPG<br/>- what sort of game shall we play?  board game, card game, RPG...?<br/><br/>We never precisely say, "Let's roleplay!"<br/><br/>Sometimes we <i>are</i> playing a role-playing <i>game</i>, with victory conditions and everything... but often enough, the thing I want to do is simply to play with some of the toys in my RPG box.</div></blockquote>\n"Let's roleplay!" is actually a lot more akin to the kind of language that my group and I use, tbh. Other than the ubiquitous terminology of "play an RPG", we avoid most of the rest of that game-y language, tbh, but that's because we all come from a background of forum-based roleplay and other kinds of freeform, so "roleplay" was the only appropriate term because there literally wasn't any game to call it. <br/>And then we transferred over that terminology into our ttrpg play. <br/>And also there's the contributing factor of that we don't value games as games, we value them as story-telling engines, so that colors our language a lot, since for us, playing a game isn't really an important bit, and what's important for us is having an engine to use to structure and organize and assist our storytelling, you know? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471198/#Comment_471198" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T19:18:57+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  7:18PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/manixur" rel="nofollow">manixur</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For the game/toy thing...

I think it was put there as a time saver. Basically giving the GM permission to extrapolate the rules for situations that were not in the book and giving the designer permission to skip over minutia that probably won't come up in game. But yes, I do believe that bad GMs use it as an excuse to dick over the players. But I don't think that is the fault of Rule Zero. Bad GMs are bad.<br/><br/>RE: AD&amp;D - Yeah, between the PHB and DMG, there is a giant pile of rules. On top of there, there are a bunch of situational rules that may not come up during play (like saving throws for magic items). So, it is not surprise that some rules were skipped on purpose and by accident.<br/><br/>Many have said it and I think that is correct. There is an urge for people playing games to customize/fix rules. Sometimes it is to fix bad rules. Sometimes it is an attempt to make the game more fair. Sometimes it is a reaction to experiences with other games. Sometimes it is an attempt to make a game more fun (what if a chess piece has to roll to defeat another chess piece?), Sometimes it is an attempt to be creative. And sometimes it is an attempt to give beginning players a chance to win.<br/><br/>How much of that happens in RPG gaming, I am not sure. Generally, me and my group try to play by the rules. The only time there is a lapse in that is when someone forgets what the rules is.<br/><br/>I was at a seminar about game design by a board game designer and his mantra was, if people don't play according to the rules and have fun, its a good game. That idea stuck with me because it was sort of a positive way to look at game play and play testing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471204/#Comment_471204" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T20:14:47+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  8:14PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>\n<blockquote>    manixur said:<br/><br/>    If, instead, we think of a "game-as-text" as being the designed rules of a game, and "game-as-played" as being the actual human experience of playing a game, the one doesn't have to imply the other.

But kids playing with those cars regularly pick and choose among those styles/rules to use, and frequently rapidly change which clusters of rules they're suing during play.<br/><br/>If RPGs are mostly just toys, then why wouldn't they follow that same pattern as playing with toy cars?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/manixur" title="manixur"><img alt="manixur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/manixur">manixur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471237/#Comment_471237" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-28T17:57:22+00:00" title="March 28, 2018  5:57PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But... that's not what a toy is?

Yes, games are like toys, in that with play with them, but it's a huge leap from there to say that the fact that we can compare them to toys means that they're fundamentally the same thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471238/#Comment_471238" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-28T18:09:00+00:00" title="March 28, 2018  6:09PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2018 6:12PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if toy-usage agreement is analogous to "system" in the Forge sense of "however the group agrees on imagined events".  Like, if we all agree on what we're doing with our toy cars, we can do it together, but if we don't agree, it's probably a mess.  Maybe any play with multiple players needs a system (aka "unwritten rules")?<br/><br/>My RPG play in high school suffered immensely from blurring the roles among game rules and unwritten rules.  Sometimes we treated the mechanics in the book like hard-and-fast game rules, and other times like toys to be played with according to our larger system (much akin to OSR systems described by "rulings, not rules").  Was the "hard rules" approach actually fun?  Was the "not hard rules" approach cheating?  Was it cool for the GM to judge which rules to use when, or was it betrayal and abuse?  Amidst all this confusion, it was hard to iron out our system, our unwritten rules.  All we agreed on was "no railroading" and "no lying about what number the dice rolled" -- not exactly a useful guide on how best to employ the tools in the rulebook.<br/><br/>Since then, I've gotten in the habit of noticing when I'm interpreting "how to play", and then getting buy-in for my interpretation.  In this way, the system of unwritten rules which emerges from troubleshooting is shared.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471239/#Comment_471239" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-28T18:30:48+00:00" title="March 28, 2018  6:30PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2018 6:32PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/manixur" rel="nofollow">manixur</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you're using rules to interact with a toy, you're playing a game</p></div></blockquote>Maybe during that exact instant, sure.

Mechanics are a toy as well as toy cars -until we set a goal, a "winning condition" to the whole play activity, <i>then</i> it becomes a game.<br/><br/>But this is too simple to be a true answer, since first we would need to get rid of lots of things that blur the lines, like:\n<blockquote>-I can set a personal goal or winning condition in a RPG without telling anyone, like "performing a memorable character". It's acceptable but that doesn't turn the toy into a game for everyone on the table, it only does so for me.<br/><br/>-The "game" can be on and off at any moment, like if my winning condition is "to defeat monsters". On social scenes there will be no game for me (which will often make me frustrated and start using any excuse to go murderhobo)<br/><br/>-The winning condition may be unclear, or we might be confused about it. It happens when the GM or the designer says something like "this game is about epic stories in a fantasy world" but then the mechanics break when players try to make a story instead of interacting with the toys given by the designer, or the GM's world breaks when the players use the toys as intended. <br/><br/>What happened there is that either the designer said one thing but meant another (like "dungeon crawl" instead or "princess game") that the GM or the players are playing the wrong game, or using the mechanics with a different intention than the ones they were menat for. Which may not be a real issue until bad experiences ensues and players start looking for someone to blame.</blockquote>\nBasically, the "game" situation in RPGs is dynamic, it can happen or not (like in story-games where the toy or we are making things happen and just enjoying the process or the result without looking for an specific resolution) it can be shared or personal, it can be stated or implied, clear or confuse, and that still doesn't affect how enjoyable the whole experience is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471253/#Comment_471253" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-29T06:54:43+00:00" title="March 29, 2018  6:54AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Airk, I guess we agree, here.

And, similarly, we're building playsets of words ( sometimes written) rather than playsets of plastic and cardstock, where our action figures have their adventures.<br/><br/>These are the toys we build with our toy maker, the RPG fluff/chargen/etc.<br/><br/>Occasionally, maybe we do use some mechanics, the types of things<i> borrowed</i> from games. Maybe it's to add excitement through uncertainty. Maybe it's to ease through known common bottlenecks in play and get play back on track ( <b>I shot ya! No ya didn't!</b>, being the classic example).<br/><br/>But that isn't really a game.

I'm interpreting that as a pretty strong statement of, "We could [perhaps barely] continue playing, because something went wrong." <br/><br/>In my experience, as far as I could tell, the GM and group were engaging in the kind of play they want to have. I just didn't enjoy it, personally, because I have different expectations from a PbtA game. But it had more to do with soft techniques and attitude - there were no moments (or almost no moments) where I could point at something and say, "Hey, we're not following this rule correctly". <br/><br/>It's more like expecting a hardcore Gamist experience when going into a D&amp;D game, and then finding that the GM gives the players an opportunity to rest between almost every encounter and hands out a lot of magical items, or plays all the monsters as really tactically stupid. You're not really breaking any particular rules (although some editions have harder guidelines about numbers of encounters and rests than others, handing out magical items or playing the monsters sub-optimally isn't against any kind of rule I'm aware of) but the game isn't fulfilling your desired creative agenda nevertheless.<br/><br/>It IS possible, however, that some Principles or Agenda were being ignored. (I don't know because I haven't read the rulebook in questions, just the move sheets and playbooks.) That's much harder to spot at the table, though. (Principles and Agenda exist in a very grey area between "rules" and "advice".)<br/><br/>I hope that helps explain the distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471287/#Comment_471287" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T21:42:32+00:00" title="March 30, 2018  9:42PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471291/#Comment_471291" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-31T01:01:30+00:00" title="March 31, 2018  1:01AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2018 1:01AM by Deliverator.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I made the assertion I did because the rules and fiction are so tightly melded in PbtA games, generally speaking.

I say it when I can't use my car for transportation.<br/>Written rules are systems open to the players. RPGs are more open, to the point where they are all equally not coherent. They come in many parts the players must hold together to play. Some (very good) games restrict this openness. Some others make it easier for the players to hold the parts (PbtA moves are very "user friendly"). Some others don't even try : they leave it to the players to break them (hey, valid horse analogy ?). Some others are contradictory, broken inside the box.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471307/#Comment_471307" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-31T13:48:16+00:00" title="March 31, 2018  1:48PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2018 1:50PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't help but see again that a lot of the disagreement here would resolve if we used the idea that I wrote above. Resuming it so it uses some other stuff written on the thread it would be: <br/><br/>-Rules, mechanics, techniques and procedures are a toy, in the same way a setting is a toy.<br/>-The Game part in RPGs is dynamic, inconstant through the session, it may be  personal, shared, implicit, confused etc. Because it's only when we set an objective or "winning" condition -while using the rules as constraints- is that the activity becomes a Game.<br/><br/>Then, can the game be <i>broken</i> and still work? Yes, some winning conditions and rules may be mutually exclusive or generate a dissonance. Like, encumbrance rules may get in the way if the winning condition is to create an epic story where "How much weight did the heroes carry?" isn't an important question to be answered. But the rest of the rules, conversational techniques of the group etc. will often make the whole game work, because they have experience with situations like these. A few more or less constraints won't make much of a difference for them. And the <i>broken game</i>part doesn't have to keep going the whole session, it will soon be replaced by another mini-game as the session changes focus.<br/><br/>Can a game be broken from the box? Sure, if the designer didn't had his goals clear or explained them badly, the game might be unplayable by RAW. Here the "game" is what the designer had in mind of course, not what gets played at the table, hence the RAW condition.<br/><br/>Can there be <i>no game</i> while we are playing with the toys? It can certainly feel like that if the goals are implied instead or expressed verbally, personal instead of shared or  somewhat undefined, like "let's have fun toying with these rules/constraints". Or if the goals keep changing before seeing completion too. Or if our efforts aren't focused on a common single part of the activity. Some mechanics and procedures that produce fiction somewhat randomly for the participants to react to, will feel like toying with rules instead of playing a game, without being less fun at all.<br/><br/>So basically, everyone is right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471310/#Comment_471310" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-31T14:14:03+00:00" title="March 31, 2018  2:14PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I roughly agree with that idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471336/#Comment_471336" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-01T18:56:01+00:00" title="April  1, 2018  6:56PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?826275-Why-do-RPG-groups-often-ignore-the-rules" rel="nofollow">similar thread I started on rpg.net</a>, I just posted the following, which addresses some problems with my original formulation picked up both here and there.\n<blockquote>Thanks all for your responses. My blog post already captured many of the reasons you've given, at least to my satisfaction, but there are some ideas that may lead me to revise it.<br/><br/>In particular, I think I muddled up this distinction:\n<ol>\n<li>RAW (rules from a single game text external to the group)<br/></li><li>Explictly agreed house rules (including those cannibalised from other games or syncretised from blogs, etc)<br/></li><li>Informal and/or implicit table conventions, habits, and norms<br/></li></ol>\nI suspect that Dan M's problem is as much with "unwillingness to do 1 or 2" as it is with "unwillingness to do 1". And I'd guess that many others who complain about (3) are similar \u2014 they can put up with house rules, as long as there's some attempt to make them explicit.<br/><br/>The great strength of (3) is that most people (neurotypical ones, anyway) have a natural talent for agreeing them, negotiating them, and remembering them. The great weakness of (3) is that the resulting "rules" are extremely difficult to examine, since they're not written down, often never spoken as such, and sometimes not even recognised as things that could be otherwise.<br/><br/>The weaknesses of (1) and (2), particularly (1), have been discussed at length in this thread. The great strengths of (1) and (2) is that they can be examined, reviewed, explicitly agreed, and communicated to other parties. In particular, if you want to sigificantly change your gaming experience, you probably need some of them. Otherwise, you're likely to drift back to your usual (3) fairly quickly.</blockquote>\nAny thoughts on the above would be appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471340/#Comment_471340" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-02T09:40:13+00:00" title="April  2, 2018  9:40AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice conclusion, Rob.

achieve what 3 does if, as said above, they focused more on how the actual table conversation should go (things like exact ritual phrases that trigger each mechanic and when to apply them, etc, a.k.a the Game) instead of focusing on the toys, because it's that conversation where the real spirit of the game manifests that let us recognize the meaning, importance and proper timing to use all the toys the designers are giving us.<br/><br/>I've got this feeling in the back of my neck since the days of the Forge but too ofter I've found too much people minimizing the issue "because everyone already knows what an RPG is and how to play it" or saying "you're underestimating your readers". I know that everyone who can read an RPG can play it... but they won't play it RAW if they don't read it in full, understand it completely nor have played another before and believe the game in their head (3) is better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471532/#Comment_471532" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-08T21:29:56+00:00" title="April  8, 2018  9:29PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2018 9:31PM by DeReel.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ranting : <br/>After watching some Actual Play, I begin to notice something unsettling. Even with open-minded seasoned players, some rules are regularly distorted, namely those for character bonding. When the rules ask that each PC be linked to another, or strongly motivated to attain a goal, there is always the player who manages to negotiate (oh, subtly) until being practically "bond free". This makes those rules very unfair in practice, giving the cheating player total legal protection.<br/>I mean : I can make rules to encourage tone and narrative consistency and stuff, but I don't know if I want to prevent players from feeding bananas into the machine if that's all they want to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471542/#Comment_471542" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T12:00:09+00:00" title="April  9, 2018 12:00PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This is well said, and is the reason why I think 90+% of people playing most editions of D&amp;D would be much happier playing Dungeon World.</p></div></blockquote>\nLooking at a lot of PbtA AP online, including DW, many people are getting its rules wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471543/#Comment_471543" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T12:07:59+00:00" title="April  9, 2018 12:07PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to stick to the rules.

If you change the rule to avoid the problem, you're still removing it -even when the replacement looks similar. You're changing the game as the designer intended.<br/><br/>Anyway, I agree that the rule will always get replaced by something else. Encumbrance rules can be removed but it will be replaced by a limit of carried items (like, you only get 5 spaces in your character sheet to write down all your stuff) or the "narrative common sense" that you can't be serious about your character carrying a ton of weapons, armor and treasure and still be able to sneak past the guards like nothing without some magical aid or the best distraction ever.<br/><br/>We may not always realize what we're exchanging those rules with but removed rules will be replaced instead, unless they are totally outside the scope of the things the group want to narrate, or already tackled by another game mechanic.
