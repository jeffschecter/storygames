I help when problems arise in client environments for whatever reason, even when (in 80% of the cases) there's actually a problem with some other piece of the environment or other computer/router/network that "isn't us". I do all that Linux, Windows, networking, NAS and SAN stuff, focusing on computer performance.<br/><br/>* It really doesn't affect my gaming style at all, except for two specific situations:<br/>-- I need to describe a business environment or something in a game (as a GM or player): I'll often imitate mannerisms of some co-workers in the game to flesh out NPCs in such a business environment (happened in "Workplace Solutions" and a PTA game)<br/>-- More commonly, any game involving cyberpunks or computer hacking, from modern PTA to Cyberpunk and Shadowrun: As a player or GM I always embellish on little side-details involved in a hacking experience that make for pure color and immersion. This really got me into a long-running Shadowrun campaign we were playing a few years ago, combining modern computer techniques and extrapolating them into "Teh Futur".<br/>For example, my orc suited fixer/hacker wouldn't "hack their system for that file I need", I'd "get a look at the hardware they have, then do an op-net search for the tech reports on it, have an AIBot scan forums and message groups for problem issues reported. OK, Alpha Dragon reports back that there were stability issues on some old motherboard firmware, and this box doesn't look updated. I sweep in using a basic user password liberated through a spycam, run some options on the hardware that causes it to crash due to a bug in that firmware. Now we just wait for the admin to log in to see what happened... ... ...and ... ...ah, there he is. I grabbed his password in a v6 packet trace, so I reboot the hardware, jump in with his credentials, force a dump of the data I need to the other user's account disguised as a restorative measure... done. Log out, log back in as the first user, and push it over the net to my remote biscuit-sized server I have installed in the basement of the Harris Teeter data center. And hell, good because I'm feeling nice I'll upgrade their motherboard firmware for them, defrag their raid array and discreetly log out."<br/><br/>Admittedly, it's useless when playing fantasy or any game that doesn't feature computers or hacking, but when it happens it can be a nice embellishment on an otherwise boring series of skill rolls or result explanations.<br/><br/>* As a player, my job both does and does not affect my gaming. I don't (often) have to stay late, I hold a normal first-shift job, so when gaming is scheduled (Wednesdays, Thursdays, and occasional weekends) I can throw down knowing that I'm not gonna get a call or page at some bizarre time. I've actually gone as far as to avoid job paths (even slightly more lucrative ones) that lead to being on a 24-hour call or the like.<br/>However, work has affected my tabletop gaming in a few ways:<br/>--When I'm at work, I'm busy. Period. So I don't often have time to blog, write campaign notes, even post on this forum in any major way during work hours.<br/>--And when 10 hours of work in front of a computer over, the last thing I often want to do is spend more time in front of a computer.<br/>--This has basically savaged my previous ability to sketch out scenario or campaign notes during a free moment at work, design or talk about designing RPGs, and that sort of thing. I tend to favor games that I can run without doing a lot of research or "campaign notes/handouts" and the like these days.<br/><br/>How about you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254886/#Comment_254886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T19:58:41+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  7:58PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 7:58PM by Brad_J_Murray.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a research engineer for an automated, safety-critical transportation system. My work pretty much never enters into play (though I did once do a safety analysis for Traveller-style ship's artificial gravity systems). My wage certainly affects my choices as a gamer -- I can host five people and feed them and make sure the booze is good. I can afford to design stuff for a lark without having to turn a buck on it. I can buy a new game if it interests me and with no other concerns (though oddly I don't buy as much as when I was broker). My work hours don't impinge on my gaming much, but then my idea of a vacation is to stay home and design something nifty. The only time it interferes is when I travel on business.<br/><br/>I do find, however, that the skills I have learned in research and in software design inform game design. Simulator design has been part of my work in the past and will be again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254891/#Comment_254891" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T20:11:50+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  8:11PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm an editorial supervisor at a wire service. My actual job skills don't really affect my gaming much, although I'm a reasonably good manager, which means you get to work on your social/communications skills a lot. Which is good for role-playing games.<br/><br/>Like Brad, my job once meant that the money spent on new games wasn't significant to me, so I would buy game stuff even if I had no real intention of playing it. But a) that got wasteful and b) I'm getting married this year, and I need to save money. (Man, shit gets expensive.)<br/><br/>My job DOES affect my gaming schedule. I am usually at work until at least 8 pm, sometimes 9 pm. I generally don't game on the weekends, and most people aren't up for starting a weekly game at 9:30 or 10 pm. So that kind of sucks. <br/><br/>(My regular gaming group is made up almost entirely of dads with 2-3 year-old kids, so that schedule works ok for them, since they can put the kids to bed and then go to the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/songsaboutrainbows" title="songsaboutrainbows"><img alt="songsaboutrainbows" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/songsaboutrainbows">songsaboutrainbows</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254896/#Comment_254896" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T20:43:02+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  8:43PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm spending this academic year working as an AmeriCorps research volunteer at a teeny tiny non-profit that does outreach and leadership development with women and girls involved in "alternative economies and activities." (That is, mostly trading sex for something else of value-money, drugs, shelter, food, probably any good you can think of.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I don't work directly with clients most of the time, I do bring elements of what I know of their lives into games. Earlier this year, for example I played a Don't Rest Your Head character who was a transgender woman involved in sex work. My gaming's been a bit limited since then for various time/logistical reasons, but I'd totally play a similar character again. I've also been kicking around ways to incorporate the bigger concepts I struggle with at work every day into game form. In particular, after doing a lot of work reading and attending a fantastic anti-racist training I'm fascinated by the idea of a game with mechanics that would somehow simulate the insidiousness of White privilege, though I'm still not entirely sure how I'd go about designing that system.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy job's also affected my play in the sense that I've had a really rocky relationship with my supervisor, largely as the result of what she perceives as flaws in my communication style. Working these issues out in the office can be uncomfortable, but I've found that gaming is a great venue for learning to pick up on nonverbal social cues, and to learn to be assertive when a situation isn't going as I want it to. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat relationship with my supervisor has also made me really long for a corporate-America themed My Life with Master game, where the Master is a corrupt boss, the Minions are office drones, and the Love is some unattainable co-worker. I should probably play basic My Life with Master first though, just to see how the system works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Our store has the most eclectic mix of customers and workers, and it inspires me to focus on strange characters and communities. My job also requires that I collect a huge amount of almost random trivia to aid in categorizing, shelving and cataloguing books. It comes in handy when gaming, as I can respond to many odd situations and give extra little details that make game worlds come alive. Also, my work with metadata has recently helped inspire a game design I'm working on for a contest over at the 1km1kt forums. One bonus, I have access to a steady supply of discount books if I want to read for inspiration.<br/><br/>Schedule-wise it has proven a bit of a pain.

If I want to take a couple hours in the middle of the day, I can, as long as I make it up that evening. Honestly, not being single anymore has impacted the time I have for gaming far more than my job at present.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as bringing professional content in, this shows up mostly as a result of my linguistics training, which means that all of my NPCs have names from (obscure) real-world language communities that are consistent within a given in-game culture, and language issues tend to be less abstracted away from. It's a good idea for a group of PCs in a foreign land to hire an interpreter in my games, or miss out on an awful lot of what's going on around them. My fieldwork made me much more interested in exploring these sorts of experiences of foreignness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe brain stuff comes up less often, though I confused the hell out of one group in a zombie game I ran because it was the spine, not the brain, that was the critical organ that kept the zombies trucking. It's a weird fact that the spine itself generates a lot of the gross commands for movement, and will continue to do so even when detached from the rest of the nervous system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254980/#Comment_254980" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T06:39:11+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  6:39AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I am currently a biosafety officer but I was trained as a molecular biologist.

I don't particularly like to break games.<br/><br/>More indirectly, my current career got me to the Seattle area and in one of the best gaming groups I've ever been with.

I've written novels in the past (and now wish I could go back and re-write them, cause I know a hell of a lot more than I used to know). But my focus now is dramatic narrative -- film and television or Internet.<br/><br/>I tend to bring everything I know about storytelling to my RPGs. I see RPGs as a little laboratory to practice storytelling techniques and craft, and the <i>fun</i> of storytelling, in a non-pressure environment. When I'm stuck on a project, I often work up settings or think about how I'd construct situations in a game of <i>Hero Wars</i> or <i>Sorcerer</i>. I suppose it'd be a little like a baseball player going off to play golf. They're both sports, but the brain is processing the activities differently. <br/><br/>I pull in everything I know from being a writer when GMing or Playing.  It's not a 1:1 correlation, of course. But there are enough direct connections between story-telling techniques across different media that it's easy to re-apply knowledge. Kicker and Bangs are the first generation children of techniques from TV and Film, for example. When I create a character as a Player, I dive right into the conflicts and personal connections with wild abandon -- I want more complications for my character and shovel story opportunity to the GM. As a GM I keep the focus this way: "The camera stays on the Player Characters because they're the leads. Sure, there's a world around them, but the world around them only matters to the degree that it reveals who the characters are." Which is how it works in a movie or TV series. Sure, that's not how reality works. But then a still life of oranges isn't really about real oranges. And that's my point: my craft of being a writer is what I bring to the table as a player of RPGs.<br/><br/>Most importantly, I think, I trust myself and other people to be creative and have a natural instinct for storytelling. Jesse Burneko once said to me, "You have this amazing ability to trust people will do interesting things!" And I replied, "Because they do!"<br/><br/>As a GM I really try to create a place for people to trust their ideas and the things they care about will be honored. I often move at a slower pace than I used to as a GM, no longer trying to be The Entertainer, and no longer trying to hammer the Players with pacing that causes stress or panic in their choices for the sake of "immersion." Instead, I'll slow things down and ask questions: "So, how is your character doing that?" Or, "Do you need a moment to think about what you want your character to do? We can cut to Colin if you need a moment."  Or, "Okay, before we go on, what does your guy think about his sister? What's the relationship been like?"<br/><br/>I play RPGs as essentially a creative act. I look at the rule, techniques and procedures I used as the focusing tools for that act of creativity. They are the limited pallet and brush we've chosen to play with, and by using these specific tools we then use them in a new combination to create <i>this</i> play <i>this</i> night.<br/><br/>I bring all this up because this comes very much from my job. My job is not to freak out when I am staring at a blank screen. My job is to mix craft with trust in the whateverthefuck the Muses are. I engage my fellow players and ask for more details -- I love details -- quick specific details that let me catch a glimpse of an image in my mind.<br/><br/>Oh. And my job is to communicate -- and to communicate clearly. To share. <br/><br/>Writing in the business I'm in isn't just sitting around Writing. Hollywood is a social place. You have meeting with executives. You have meetings with producers. You go into an office, spread your mat, put out the bowl for coins and tell stories. They either put coins in the bowl or not.  <br/><br/>I see RPGs as a very socially creative activity. As I GM I ask people to share details. As a Player I ask people to share details. I want to know what that cool image in their head was. I want to know what that gesture that I saw them think about that their character doing but that they didn't say out loud. I'll ask, "Hey, wait, I know your guy just said goodbye to her, but what happened. What was that like." Not all the time. Of course. Some moments are just incident to skip over. But the act of telling a story is the accumulation of details that hook us in to one level or another.  When I'm at a table, I want us all sharing those details that <i>matter</i> to each of us.<br/><br/><br/>As for how my job affects my game time, it's getting tougher, honestly. The work of years is beginning to pay off now and I need more time to focus on several projects at one time.<br/><br/>Moreover, I've learned, finally, that to get done what you want takes a lot of focused energy. I said to a friend a few months ago, "I had no idea how much effort it took <i>just to stand still</i> in Hollywood."<br/><br/>The truth is, RPGs were the arena I played in for years because that's the arena I <i>could</i> play in. Now I'm playing in a different arenas (writing a feature film assignment; just sold a pitch for a TV pilot; setting up a feature to write and direct in 2011; setting up a mini-series to write about the history of Saudi Arabia...)<br/><br/>Part of me isn't sure exactly how much time is left for RPGs, since what I got from them is being answered by my professional ambitions coming true. On the other hand, I feel a debt to RPGs. Through both positive and negative example, I know I'm becoming a writer people <i>trust</i> because of things I learned at the gaming table or struggled with once I stepped away from the gaming table. What I wanted from RPGs I've gotten, and now I'm getting it at work too.  I'm curious to see what gaming will mean for me this coming year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255217/#Comment_255217" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T10:38:04+00:00" title="February  5, 2010 10:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being an otherwise unemployed college student gives me plenty of time to game, prepare for games, and write games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielleLewon" title="DanielleLewon"><img alt="DanielleLewon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielleLewon">DanielleLewon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255220/#Comment_255220" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T10:55:29+00:00" title="February  5, 2010 10:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am an architectural historian and have been working for Detroit for 10 years.

It pays almost decently, so I can afford my gaming habit for the most part -- but it means that I haven't had weekends off in twenty years.  That makes scheduling a regular RPG campaign challenging, to say the least.  I wind up running (or occasionally playing) short sessions, four hours tops, on weeknights.  The sessions have to be cut short because some of my gamer friends have 'day jobs' and can't stay up 'till all hours like I do.  <br/><br/>Looking at my professional skill set as gaming tools:  The mathematical and analytical portions of the job give me a <i>lot</i> of knowledge about card and dice probability, which has some application in my hobby life. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It also makes me very aware that most people don't usually have any serious grasp of probability or risk assessment.  (In gamers this is not usually a bad thing, since most games aim for a 'cinematic' rather than 'realistic' set of risk outcomes.)  My technical knowledge of cameras and video recording equipment lets me put lots of detail into games where surveillance plays a part.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Since I have pretty regular contact with law enforcement professionals of various sorts, I can leverage my experience with that for characterizations of police NPCs in games that I run.  Likewise with 'casino insiders' and professionals.  Since I people-watch professionally, I can usually come up with interesting or at least quirky NPCs, just based on the things that I've seen.<br/><br/>Since part of my job is detecting cheats and being generally suspicious of people breaking (or even bending) the rules, I have picked up a lot of knowledge about cons, scams, and other assorted forms of misbehavior.  It's all great plot-fodder for games!  But the downside of this is that I am very critical of fictional plots where the details aren't fully laid out.  I tend to over-analyze the failure-points of such things, and my NPC villains often seem to over-plan as much as I do...  I expect that it also makes me put too much extraneous detail into mystery-plots I design.  It makes it hard for the players to figure out whats a 'clue' and whats a 'detail'.  In real life, no investigation works like they work on TV or in the movies -- there's no way to prune the dead-end branches off, and sometimes you follow useless leads or mistaken assumptions for a long time before you realize that they <i>are</i> dead ends.  On TV, the dead-ends get skipped -- and I think they should get skipped in most RPGs too.  I just can't seem to do it.  <img alt=":\\" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":\\"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255414/#Comment_255414" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T15:41:12+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  3:41PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a technical marketing writer and consultant.

Staying involved yet keeping a solid record is a skill that requires practice, but I love doing this dance.  I get antsy if I'm in a game where it's all left to unwritten memory.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I get paid to do various kinds of "big picture" planning, and I'm happiest when my games have the longevity and space to do serious long-term, big-scope planning and execution which makes an impact on the world.  Very similar to the kind of environments I like to work in, but amped to 11.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. My chosen industry and profession demand that we invent things as we go.  Similarly, in gaming, I'm really happiest playing in games where we sit at the table and make stuff up as we go, letting explicit "book rules" come and go as we like.  It's easy and comfortable, and lets the imagination soar.  Sitting down and *playing to someone else's text*, specific rules or existing setting, feels less appealing year after year.  Inventing the game as we play it -- or, feeling like that -- is the kind of gaming I enjoy most.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256251/#Comment_256251" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T00:23:16+00:00" title="February 12, 2010 12:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I drive trucks in a coal mine for a living and have been doing it for about six years. Looking for a career change actually, since I kinda hate it.<br><br>It really affects my ability to actually game. I work out of town and I'm usually gone for a few days at a time, and my roster is irregular so I don't always have the same days off. And most of my gaming group have to stick to their schedules, what with having real lives and all that. I can't start a band for the same reasons.<br><br>The one advantage is that because it's fairly monotonous and repetitive, I can do it on autopilot and that means I get a lot of time to think, and I think about gaming a lot. Of course, then I get all hyped up to play and oh wait everybody is busy when I'm home.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my main job I'm a photogrammetrist.  That's someone who looks at stereo images of the earth either taken from a plane or satellite (and the company I work for has both) and creates a 3d model and Geodatabase of everything on the ground including rivers, roads, bridges and buildings.  You name it. I'm also the supervisor for the night shift.  On the side I'm an adjunct college professor teaching art classes including basic design, drawing and painting.  I'd love to do the latter full time, but such positions are difficult to find. <br/><br/>The photogrammetrist thing doesn't really affect games other than increasing my already unhealthy fascination with maps and being intensly aware of the 'rules.'  The teaching side feeds into my GMing style in terms of having clear communication.<br/><br/>In the photogrammetry job I'm a night worker, so my clock is off everyone elses.  That makes it hard to game more than I do.  I've been trying to figure a skype thing but most people just don't mesh with my schedule.  Second, holding two jobs can make me really busy, which again interferes with scheduling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256307/#Comment_256307" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T08:58:13+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  8:58AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am studying to become an architect with a specialty in landscape and urban planning:<br/>\n<br/>\nThusly I am a worldbuilder type and spend way too much time making stuff up and I can draw sketchy maps in a jiffy or make detailed blueprints for tactical games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a ton of experience working the creative process, both for myself, in groups and for the uninitiated. We have a special focus on citizen inclusion in the planning process here, which means a lot of listening and facilitating, which parallels into games; where I prefer helping others build on their ideas rather than bring on my own. As a gamemaster I like setting up a space for interaction, rather than narrating a story. As a player I spend my time imagining the fictitious events and perhaps drawing them afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more meta-gaming note, I am trying to free roleplaying theories and tools from the verbal realm and make some proper graphical models, to see if new sides come to light or if it can be said in a nicer way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe format of teaching mean that I have varying amounts of free time, during lecture weeks and in the start of a semester I have tons of time, but during workshops and in the final month before the deadline I barely exist in the real world. This means I mostly do one-off games, but I am getting hungry for some campaign play these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256716/#Comment_256716" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T03:32:03+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  3:32AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm both a psychotherapist ad a HR freelance consultat, coach and trainer.

I work one on one with students with cognitive, behavioral, and physical issues (mostly autism) in a classroom of six children ranging from ages 4 to 10. All the kids in my class are non-verbal, most are self injurious and not toilet trained. There's nothing like being punched in the face by a 10 year old because you told her to pick up a puzzle piece she threw, or doing a full body restraint on the same child so she'll stop smashing her head against a wall or throwing chairs or punching you in the face. The work is physically and emotionally demanding. I absolutely love my job. <br><br/>I started this job six months ago. Before that I was a sleep tech. I worked nights, one on one with patients, conducting sleep studies. I basically watched breathing patterns and brain waves all night. I worked with very young children and very old children--adults, I mean. My interactions with patients involved me placing electrodes on them from head to toe, putting them at ease (because really, who likes being watched while they sleep, especially attached to 26-50 wires). I also loved that job, but was so happy to get laid off because I would not have to work nights any more.<br/><br/>The things I love and loved about both jobs is working with people in an oddly intimate manner, dealing with neurological "stuff", and collecting data. As a behavioral instructor, I spend very little time staring at a computer, which has encouraged me to unplug when at home. <br/><br/>So how does it affect my gaming? I tend to play characters who are either extremely social or anti-social and are psychologically or emotionally manipulative, but not always in a negative way. And given my medical and behavioral psych background, most of my characters have some involvement in healing arts--which you can interpret how you want. <br/><br/>My characters tend to speak very plainly, directly, and matter of factly. It comes from the behaviorism, patient care, and being a mom to 2 daughters.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buckyball" title="buckyball"><img alt="buckyball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buckyball">buckyball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256897/#Comment_256897" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T20:17:46+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  8:17PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a clinical geneticist and for about 5 years I played in a Dark Conspiracy game with an electrical engineer, a guy who had a somethingth degree black belt in karate and an FBI agent.

It bothers me when the Olympic announcers horribly mangle Chinese names (for example, the Chinese hockey player that just scored against Finland; they're not only calling her by her given name, not knowing that the order of names is reversed in East Asia, but slaughtering it into three syllables: "Lee-no-oh" from Li-nuo"), so you can imagine how I feel in game table situations.  Eventually I may write a China-related game or hack that gets around some of these issues.<br/><br/>I played Primetime Adventures in Chinese one time. That was great. No trouble there.<br/><br/>I often feel the need to research and at least attempt to accurately depict real places and people in games.  I don't have to get everything right, but I feel like depicting real things requires being grounded in real information, because expanding your (and other people's) knowledge is great and, to paraphrase Jason Morningstar, the real world is cooler and more bizarre than anything you can imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/okiran" title="okiran"><img alt="okiran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/okiran">okiran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256907/#Comment_256907" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T22:07:02+00:00" title="February 16, 2010 10:07PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a 4th grade teacher (USA).

But in the other direction, I guess what ends up happening is:<br/><br/>1. I complain about the lack of non-white characters and often end up playing them, even though in reality I'm about the whitest white dude there is (well, my name's not Blake, or anything).<br/><br/>2.

It was a really good job for the most part. I got to hang out with my friend and fellow artist in our little art bunker behind the food storage, blasting music, working hard, making signs, providing a listening ear to distraught coworkers, and laminating EVERYTHING. My schedule was great for gaming - for a while I was running or playing in 2-3 regular games and going to a number of Northeast cons. I can't say much of my job leaked into playing. I tend to avoid playing artsy characters because I like playing characters different from me, but as with all walks of life, I can better flavor descriptions with what (and whom) I know. Working with a lot of difficult customers has probably improved my communication skills and patience which is helpful in any social situation.<br/><br/>That was a few months ago. Now I'm a mom and I'm staying at home to take care of our infant son and get the house we moved into in order. Once I'm on my feet a little more I plan to set up some studio space and more actively pursue life as a professional artist - making practical pottery, sculptural ceramics and possibly collage illustration for childrens books. Having a baby has definitely affected my gaming - I'm not doing any right now! But we're going to Dreamation this weekend and hoping we can each get in a couple of games while trading off baby-care duties. I'm hoping to at least start GMing a regular Burning Wheel game again, but that may take another couple of months to get going. I don't know yet if parenthood will affect me much at the table - I'm more sensitive now to stories of bad things happening to children, but I doubt that will change anything.<br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256987/#Comment_256987" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-17T11:55:16+00:00" title="February 17, 2010 11:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been wanting to comment on this thread for awhile, finally getting around to it.<br/><br/>I'm a high school math teacher, emphasis on both "math" and "teacher," and I am strongly in the camp of "my profession informs my gaming *and* vice versa."<br/><br/>Bullet points:<br/>-GMing is like teaching, only easier\u2014fewer people, easier to build buy-in; the group dynamics aspect requires the same basic set of skills.<br/>-Knowing math makes me allergic to fudging and to badly-thought-out mechanics.<br/>-Straight-up acting skills, which I have via RP, are also useful in teaching\u2014control your emotions, build a wall, set boundaries.<br/>-GM prep is only useful if it gives the players something interesting with which to interact; ditto for teacher prep.<br/><br/>My RL-area of knowledge that I use most often with my characters, however, is music.

That's helpful with situation setting and determining action/reaction of such organizations.<br/><br/><i>Edited to add an echo to what Christopher said above about communication and creative process.

Obviously, this does interesting things to my schedule. Mostly, it's daily work, off by 5-6pm most weekdays, and off weekends. With semi-early mornings, staying up too late is a bad idea. I do it anyway, but it's a bad idea. However, sometimes I am gone for weeks at a time, doing some sort of field training, so the gaming has to stop. I do tend to have time to think about gaming, and I do. Then of course there are deployments. I've only been deployed once, and was fortunate enough to have a decent group while I was, although we lost some and gained some as people were shifted around to different units, patrols and schedules. It was 12-hour shifts, but we managed to work out a pretty steady window to do some sort of gaming twice a week most weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as how it affects the fiction, I tend to think in military patterns in any game that allows for it. Any game with military themes in the fiction I draw pretty heavily from my own experiences. Usually, I game with other Soldiers, so their mindsets are the same. It tends to mesh well. There are a lot of things in 3:16 that no one had to explicitly say: A SGT is nigh unto a god when his squad is in the field. Also, the backgrounds of Soldiers are usually pretty varied. Playing with civilians in Phoenix, most of them have been in the area for most of their lives. Almost none of the Soldiers I've gamed with came from the same towns or areas of the country, social status, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso: Zombie Cinema in Kuwait.
