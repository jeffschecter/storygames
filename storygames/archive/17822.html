The engine's design is ingenious in that the games practically run themselves once the consequences of partial successes and failed rolls start snowballing, but you need very invested players who are willing and able to declare things about the world when asked and to take action on their own instead of just waiting for the MC to give them things to respond to-- the MC role is very reactive in these games, and it's hard to pre-plan events when the results of moves can so quickly send events spiraling off into unseen territory.  These games live and die by how engaged the players are with their chosen genre, and how good everyone is at thinking on their feet.<br/><br/>So it's kind of hard to say "what kind of game you play with it" because that entirely depends on what the players at the table feel like pursuing.  AW and MH both loosely establish a genre, and imply certain ground rules with their moves and playbooks and GMing principles, but beyond that one table's game is going to be very different from another.  Apocalypse games are very old-school in that way, I think, and I imagine Dungeon World is no different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403300/#Comment_403300" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T08:39:17+00:00" title="January 10, 2013  8:39AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They do definitely run themselves, and everyone love the system for that.

I guess that might be a particular stumbling block with DW-- if you're coming to it from pretty much any modern version of D&amp;D and attempt to play it in the same way, you're probably going to be bored.  I'd imagine it's for people who want to play a game about pulp dungeon crawling but actively do not want the same level of mechanical engagement as D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403307/#Comment_403307" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T09:10:42+00:00" title="January 10, 2013  9:10AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2013 9:11AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>They do definitely run themselves, and everyone love the system for that.

Ideally, you can find entertainment in the stories you're telling moreso than the rules that facilitate the story. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17813/world-of-dungeonsshadows-why-i-can039t-go-back" rel="nofollow">Seems I have the opposite opinion of you.</a> The simplicity of the mechanics and the focus on the fiction is what I like.<br/><br/>The strategy and tactics is in the description of what's going on within the fiction.

I think the key here is to get players to focus on generating changes in the fiction rather than in the game mechanics. For example:<br/>a PC is attacked by mechanical squid, and tries to throw a cloak over it. If you roll success<br/>option 1: you get +1 forward against it ... IMO bad as its just in the mechanics<br/>option 2: the squid is blind, zig-zagging around the room and flailing its tentacles ... much better as its in the fiction<br/><br/>Note that this also means that players that try to throw cloaks over the squid to blind it are better off than those that just say "I dodge" or "I hit it". This is where the player involvement is key. You might kinda have to lead them along a bit at first with "what's your objective here?" or "exactly how do you do that?" type of questions when they say something bland. Also ham it up for your moves, throw characters against walls, pin them to the floor, etc to show them that anything goes (as long as it makes sense in the fiction/around the table).<br/><br/>rgds<br/>rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403430/#Comment_403430" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T08:10:15+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  8:10AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure that I agree the *W games reward "creative" squid blinding more than "uninspired" hack and slashing. Garden variety "I stab him" seems pretty common and fully supported by the rules. The difference is that squid blinding is ALSO supported by the rules. It's not that the characters should feel like they are obligated to think up fancy solutions to situations or else they are failing, it's that they CAN think of fancy solutions, and the rules will still elegantly produce a result. <br/><br/>I think the *W games are plenty complex. Probably more complex than many games that have multiple sub systems. I mean, at the bottom of most subsystems, all you are REALLY doing is determining the probability of success. Like, if you have to roll lower than a stat on 3d6 to determine success, you are just saying that you have n% chance of success. If you are calculating your OCV - the enemy's DCV and adding modifiers to hit and blah blah blah you are STILL just saying that you have an n% chance of success. Maybe it FEELS like the subsystems are different (or maybe I'm not being fair) but usually, all you end up with is a character's success or failure. The *W games are different because the rolls aren't really about success and failure -- they are about generating unpredictable outcomes.<br/><br/>The GM (or MC) moves are an important part of the equation that shouldn't be overlooked. Typically, the GM makes a "soft move" and then says, "what do you do?" The player then makes a "player move" (or chooses not to), and the dice are (usually) rolled. At that point there are numerous possible outcomes depending on the chosen move, the dice results, the fictional circumstances, &amp;c. And, the game cannot be easily predicted. [Importantly, if the player rolls 6 or less it doesn't NECESSARILY mean that the thing the character tried to do fails, it just means that the GM "makes a hard move," which could, of course, include the character's failure. But, the character COULD ALSO succeed at whatever he or she attempts and suffer a hard move for a reason other than task failure.] So, the game goes 1. GM soft move 2. player move 3. consequences of player move (including possible GM hard move) repeat. Many other games follow pretty much the same pattern, but they have more elaborate number crunching -- which to me feels LESS engrossing. Chess is tactically complex even though you don't have to do any multiplication.                            </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403432/#Comment_403432" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T08:39:10+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  8:39AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2013 8:40AM by noclue.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But all those GM moves cry out for creative fiction.

You know, there's no real "score keeping" to track and no hard finish line. I haven't played any AW but there are countdown clocks and things to help give that "objective" score keeping. So it's there but can be overruled easily.<br/><br/> Sometimes, in story games, there is a bit of dependence on GM/player fiat/storytelling that really makes the game. And that's a perfectly valid play solution - unless you're not feeling it. There seems to be a strong vibe to a successful AW-style game that you can hit or miss; it's all about hard, emotional choices. You may not always be up for deciding whether to buy food for the orphans or to buy more ammunition for the imminent attack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein" title="Nifelhein"><img alt="Nifelhein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/888/nUG22UPKX7MJD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein">Nifelhein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403498/#Comment_403498" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T17:11:34+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  5:11PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The system is not truly about engaging the players with mechanics, it is about giving the GM tools to make the fiction engaging, to do otherwise you would need to tailor moves and playbooks to a particular game, imo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403499/#Comment_403499" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T18:05:53+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  6:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Isn't that what "point-buy, builds, feats, and mechanical choices" is all about? </blockquote>\nJust showing examples of some mechanics that provide interesting tactical choices in games that aren't DW.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parenon" title="Parenon"><img alt="Parenon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parenon">Parenon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403501/#Comment_403501" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T18:58:46+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  6:58PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I get this concern with regards to tactics, I've yet to play any AW-inspired games, though I've read AW and DW and hope to run them at some point. And the tactics concerns in my opinion don't have to have anything to do with point-buy, builds, feats, etc (character sheet stuff). But let's say that the tactics involves a ranger using a waist high garden fence for cover while engaging goblin archers. There's little doubt that in the fiction, this would lead to blocking some but not all possible shots. Should we be creating a custom move that says "When standing behind partial cover take +1 Armor Ongoing?" <br/><br/>Maybe that is the answer, I don't know. Obviously if somebody comes at them from another angle, or with an axe, that move would not apply to their attacks. However I feel like without this custom move it'd be more or less GM fiat when the cover works vs. when it doesn't, or all tactical decisions of similar nature would merely result in taking +1 forward to your next roll, if anything. Regardless of the fictionally sound and reasonably intelligent approach to the encounter, without custom moves it seems like there's no particularly good reason mechanically why the ranger should fight from the fence rather than out in the open field. This to me feels like a (over-exaggeration) betrayal of the fiction. It wouldn't matter as much in a game without combat focus like Monsterhearts (which appears to have a good mechanic for enforcing who gains advantages/disadvantages in its area of focus). But since Dungeon World is very heavy on combat it feels awkward that we're simultaneously encouraging all this great fictional interaction while simultaneously giving it little ability to enforce itself mechanically in battle.<br/><br/>That being said as I've yet to actually play a game of DW I cannot speak from experience. It could just be a personal stumbling block because the primary games I've run as GM are The Laundry Files (BRP), Eclipse Phase, and Traveller, which all have at least some tactical focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403502/#Comment_403502" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T19:05:09+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  7:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2013 7:05PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we just like to talk about this stuff.

If you expose yourself again, you might get hit."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403515/#Comment_403515" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T20:32:13+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  8:32PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2013 8:35PM by noclue.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/parenon">@parenon</a>, If you try to stamp out GM fiat with custom moves, you will end up having to write a completely new game and that game will be a pale shadow of Dungeon World. <br/><br/>Instead, the GM can make moves that follow from the fiction, in line with their principals and that fulfill the GM agenda.

At least, I think that will hold true for most cases. In your example it's the fact that you're ignoring shields. If nothing else, attacking someone at a disadvantage will mean the GM cannot, while respecting the fiction, give you the same result on a miss as they could have given if you did not have the advantage.<br/><br/>Taken to its extreme, the strange thing is that you do get +1 when you read the sitch. Getting to know what the GM, who pretty much calls the shots, honestly think is the best way to beat his monsters, should be a great success anyway. This is how "read a person" works \u2013 when I get to know how to make your character come with me, no questions asked, I don't also get a +1 to my roll to manipulate them into doing that. The knowledge of what it would take, or what they're really feeling, is enough of a success.<br/><br/>I agree that there's a difference between your two examples with the shield, but I think you should look at it the other way around: rolling for reading a sitch (mechanics) can give you a bonus (mechanics) conditional on you using a certain tactic (fiction). It starts at the mechanical end \u2013 or rather, the fictional end even before that, when you acually "do it to do it", that is, describe how you're reading the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403620/#Comment_403620" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-13T15:01:24+00:00" title="January 13, 2013  3:01PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2013 3:09PM by noclue.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And so, going back to this:\n<blockquote>But let's say that the tactics involves a ranger using a waist high garden fence for cover while engaging goblin archers.

The leader takes an arrow to the arm and he's obviously wounded pretty bad but still standing. They're scurrying down there getting their flatbows reloaded and the leader has ducked behind the parapet, what do you do?<br/>Ranger: I'll take another shot. <br/>GM: Roll your damage again. You see one of the archers fall, an arrow sticking out of his eye. One of their bolts whistles by your ear, actually clipping it as it goes by, but the rest pelt the stones. What now?<br/>Ranger: One more time!<br/>GM: Awesome. Make a hack and slash roll. The orcs have found their range now. Bolts are sailing by you pretty close and one finds your shoulder for 3 pts damage. On the bright side, you can see an orc fall over bleeding from his abdomen where your arrow went right through him. Down below the leader screams something at a few of the orcs and they drop their flatbows and start charging your position. The other orcs are reloading.

In the post immediately above, what are you agreeing with, Paul?  What does using the fiction to inform the mechanics look like?  Under what circumstances and in which games doesn't that happen?  Based on the stuff I'm writing below, about the hammer-table-shield example, can you tell what I'm missing?\n<blockquote>1. You're attacking an enemy, and you've climbed up onto a table so that you can swing your hammer over their short shields. You read the situation and you know that this is how they're vulnerable, so you get +1.<br/><br/>Later, you fight the same enemy again in the same space:<br/><br/>2. You're attacking the enemy, and you've climbed up onto a table so that you can swing your hammer over their short shields. But you missed your "read a sitch" roll (which, incidentally, doesn't exist in DW). Or you didn't ask that question. Or you didn't have a chance to make the move. Or your stat for that move isn't very good, so you don't want to.<br/><br/>Now, the advantage or tactic you're using no longer impacts the mechanics in any direct way. Do we agree on this?</blockquote>\nI understand the scenario you've set up such that incident 1 happened and then incident 2 did.  Right?  If that's the case, there are some things I want to interject before addressing whether we agree about the impact of tactics on mechanics.  <br/><br/>During incident 1, you read the sitch and got told that standing on the table to reach over the shields would give you a +1.  Why aren't you just taking that +1 during incident 2?  You reference failing to read the sitch which implies to me that you've rolled again, but I don't see why.  The move (and I know I'm talking about AW and not DW here -- I know one well and the other only peripherally) includes this line, "<i>whenever</i> you act on one of the MC\u2019s answers, take +1" (though the emphasis is mine).<br/><br/>But that may be just nit-picking if your real point is that you can fail the roll or not ask that question or not make the roll because you're not very sharp in the first place.  OK, so if you're not very sharp or you failed the roll, that means you're not good at analyzing battlefield tactics (or it just didn't work out this time) and didn't appropriately realize how best to work around the enemies' shields.  <br/><br/>Is that tactics not impacting mechanics?  It's mechanics impacting tactics impacting mechanics.<br/><br/>So let's say you like getting a +2 for flanking in some other game.  You love that; It's easy advantage!  Only this bugbear you're facing is in a corridor and has goblin minions at his back you can't get someone around him to engage that rule.  Is that a case where your tactics don't impact the mechanics?<br/><br/>In AW, your tactics impact mechanics in (at least) the following ways: <br/> - You can get +1 by reading a sitch and acting on the MC's answers.<br/> - The moves available to you are based on what you do and how you set things up.<br/> - Preparing in specific ways, or manipulating the situation shapes which MC moves are available.<br/> - Those same preparations and manipulations shape which results are 'on the table' for certain moves (e.g. what a soft hit looks like when acting under fire or going aggro ).<br/> - Some preparation or manipulations (tactical engagement, right?) can cause custom moves to spring up out of nothing.

I mean, the +1s that you get from Reading a Sitch are basically an incentive for the players and GM to have a conversation about what's happening (i.e. the player using Read a Sitch), and then following through on the fictional positioning that is described in that conversation (the player acting on the answers with +1).<br/><br/>Instead, fictional positioning matters more in that it <i>places limits and creates opportunities in terms of what the GM and players can describe</i>. If the archer is shooting from behind some cover, as GM I can't effectively describe the enemies shooting back at the archer with any real effect. Hard moves I make on them are unlikely to include "deal damage as established" because that damage would be pretty negligable because they have cover. On the other hand, the enemies may get frustrated with this situation and decide to, say, set the archer's cover on fire. That's an opportunity for the GM to take advantage of. All fictional positioning is like that, in that it creates a new context for both players and the GM to describe different things happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403664/#Comment_403664" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T10:46:19+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 10:46AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really interesting to me. I always found the static situational bonuses of D&amp;D to be annoying, like "flanking" was just a Thing you could do and it was always the same. In DW, if you've established that the enemy can't defend against you, then you often get to just deal damage, not get a bonus or something. In my experience, it engages the fiction in ways previous dungeoncrawlers never did. So the idea that it's somehow <i>less</i> tactical is boggling my mind.<br/><br/>Granted, if you're super into seeing everything laid out numerically ("I have a 25% better chance now!"), then DW is probably <i>not</i> the system for your group. It's not any better or worse, I guess, it's just not your taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403666/#Comment_403666" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T11:42:37+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 11:42AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 3:52PM by creases.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rules for <i>read a sitch</i> and <i>discern realities</i> are different. In AW, <i>read a sitch</i> says, "Whenever you act on one of the MC\u2019s answers, take +1." In DW, <i>discern realities</i> says, "take +1 forward when acting on the answers."<br/><br/>+1 forward means +1 to the next single roll you make. That's a limit that exists in DW but not in AW.<br/><br/>This suggests to me that in AW RAW, the intent is for the PC to get that +1 whenever the information happens to be useful again in the future. But not in DW RAW---in DW, you take your bonus now, while you have the chance, and who knows what happens next time.<br/><br/>ETA: I suppose the DW rule has an ambiguity: It might mean, you take +1 on your next roll only if you are acting on the MC's answers (otherwise you lose the bonus). Or it might mean, you take +1 on the next roll you make that acts on the MC's answers (and the bonus will wait until that happens). Either way, though, "+1 forward" suggests to me that you get +1 for one roll per answer and that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403682/#Comment_403682" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T14:43:25+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  2:43PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that when people say "fictional positioning" the group who feels like there aren't enough tactics just hears, "GM fiat and hand waving when it comes to the detail." But, I don't think that's exactly what is happening in DW. Maybe some of the frustration over the tactical limitations of DW come from an attempt to graft DW rules onto another more war gamey system when the rules in DW do a different thing . . .   <br/><br/>I don't think it's useful to imagine an event in DW as if you are watching it from a bird's eye view and then plot it on a hex map, or anyway, not for the same reasons you do it in a war game. There aren't a series of rounds in DW in which the PCs each take a turn and then a round when the bad guys take a turn. There IS NO "bad guy turn." The MC never "gets to go" in the traditional sense. Like, in the garden wall cover example, you don't get a +1 to reflect the fact that you are protected because that just doesn't matter. It's not like the MC will roll his attack, take your position into consideration, and then calculate the effect of cover. The MC NEVER ROLLS EVER. The MC will only make a "soft move." That's all the MC ever does unless prompted by a roll. So, if you're crouched behind a garden wall that is providing partial protection from archers, the MC will make a soft move like, "the archers got smart and shot a flaming arrow into your garden wall -- it is now on fire, WHAT DO YOU DO?" or "you are safe where you are, but your blind NPC friend is likely to be a pin cushion, unless you run into the no-man's-land and save him, WHAT DO YOU DO?" or "you are protected from most of the archers who are firing wildly, but you notice one archer in a black mask take his time and take aim for a small gap in the wall, WHAT DO YOU DO?" or whatever. Then you do something -- that something is (usually) one of your player moves -- each of which will create a different outcome because they are different moves AND because your roll will result in a different outcome. So, there are all kinds of tactical choices to make based on the soft move you are reacting to, the type of character you have, the moves you have, &amp;c., and no matter what you do, there will be a mechanical effect. <br/><br/>I don't see why this requires more narrative skill on the part of the player than systems with more number crunching. In the example above where the MC and the player only want to read moves from their sheets and do the bare minimum amount of narration (which is a hard group for me to imagine, but just for the sake of argument) it would still work. The MC would choose from his monster moves just like a DM chooses a dragon's breath weapon or its claws, the MC would make his soft move, "the dragon inhales and you see smoke come out of its nostrils -- it seems like it will exhale soon WHAT DO YOU DO?" then the player makes a move like "I jump out of the way" (defy danger) or "I stab it before it can exhale" (hack and slash) or whatever, then you roll the dice . . . when the smoke clears, the GM makes another soft move, and you proceed.    <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403684/#Comment_403684" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T16:12:49+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  4:12PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 4:15PM by noclue.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But generally players who enjoy games with limited narration are finding their fun elsewhere, like tactical simulation or overcoming challenges.

I think when you wrote, "I think that if you're missing [the ability of the players to use the fiction to inform the mechanics], the game might not be... very interesting," it feels like an indictment of the games we're talking about but maybe simply misunderstood..?<br/></blockquote>\nYes, that sounds right to me. My indictment was:\n<blockquote><br/>The fiction is reflected in the moves chosen, the descriptions offered, and the choices on the table to partial hits and misses.<br/><br/>It's not reflected in bonuses and penalties in this system.<br/><br/>For it [i.e. the game] to work as a fun tactical exercise, the group has to be able to use the fiction to inform the mechanics, as in the examples above.<br/><br/>I think that if you're missing that, the game might not be... very interesting.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat I was trying to say was that if you play Dungeon World and you approach it mechanics-first ("What can I do here? It looks like I have the choice of two basic moves..."), without anyone (particularly the MC) using the fiction to constrain move choices (e.g. "OK, you suffer damage," regardless of what move was missed or under what circumstances), you probably won't have much fun.<br/><br/>For example, like this:<br/><br/>"Ok, you see a monster! It roars and raises its claws! What do you do?"<br/>"I hack and slash it, with my sword!"<br/>"Ok, roll the move."<br/>"Partial hit. You both inflict damage, roll the dice. What do you now?"<br/>[repeat until someone is defeated]<br/><br/>That probably wouldn't be the most fulfilling game.<br/><br/>I think that some people, when they read the rules (and even when they use them at the table), well, this is how the see the game operating.<br/><br/>Imagine for a minute that the GM/MC isn't quite getting the game, and this is how they're running the fight. You're a player in this game, and you've never played before. You look down at your sheet: what can you do? You can't see too many options for gaining a bonus to the roll, and you can't see any way to increase your damage, or maybe you can see something, but it's only one option or two options.<br/><br/>"Man," you think, "what a boring game."<br/><br/>I'm taking a wild guess by posting in this thread that this is what the OP may have meant when s/he wrote:\n<blockquote>[...] the more I sit here and think about the more I begin to think that the simplicity of the game is its weakness. The variety of mechanics, and tactics to engage with are limited. By the end of the first session we often feel like we have seen everything that the game has to offer. </blockquote>\nWhat else could they mean? I'm curious. My mind immediately went in this direction, but maybe there's another interpretation.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403691/#Comment_403691" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T17:42:04+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  5:42PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Paul T:</b> That is for sure a thing (great description, by the way).

If players approach their options with the list in mind, it's much more constrained looking. But in reality you can <i>do anything,</i> and occasionally a move gets triggered by it. If you use that approach, suddenly tactics and positioning take on a whole new level. You start building the odds in your favor to make a compelling case for <i>not</i> triggering a move at all. That's interesting, is what that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403715/#Comment_403715" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T23:43:29+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 11:43PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making certain you follow fiction first is important for an interesting <a href="/forums/profile/world">@world</a> game. When I first played DW I used to catch myself making moves without fiction all the time and it *is* boring.  <br/><br/>Just thought I'd chime in with my own custom rule/move for cover/advantages. <br/><br/>When the monsters have an advantage in numbers, they get extra damage dice. If the players find/create/some other advantage cover during a missile battle I start removing these dice. <br/><br/>Example: <br/>4 orcs are firing at one of the characters who is out in the open. They get the best of four dice for damage. <br/><br/>In the next round the player scrambles behind a table that has been upended and now has cover.  If the player now partially succeeds or fails on a volley, the orcs now roll 3 or fewer damage dice (I'd probably go for two dice). <br/><br/>If there is only one orc left then he might even have to roll two damage dice and take the lower one (unless both parties are in cover).  <br/><br/>I certainly don't use this all the time but it does work quite well.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403727/#Comment_403727" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T08:35:49+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  8:35AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stu, that's real clever and I'ma steal it.

In DW there really isn't a whole lot of places to find your fun if you strip the narration out of it. Even your dragon breath example is starting to insert narration and evocative details.</blockquote>\nI agree that Dungeon World doesn't seem to be built for limited narration. In fact, the game clearly encourages narration. And, I also agree that if a person wants a game that is only about mechanical considerations, there are games that might be a better fit. The point I wanted to make though was that people shouldn't feel like they have to be gifted improvisers in order to play and have fun. Players who maybe don't like to come up with off the wall solutions shouldn't feel intimidated, and players who like to think through multiple options won't be bored. <br/><br/>Paul_T gave an example of a potentially boring game . . . <br/>"Ok, you see a monster! It roars and raises its claws! What do you do?"<br/>"I hack and slash it, with my sword!"<br/>"Ok, roll the move."<br/>"Partial hit. You both inflict damage, roll the dice. What do you now?"<br/>[repeat until someone is defeated]<br/><br/>The reason that game would have been boring is not because the players weren't being jazzy and creative, it would be because the MC didn't follow the rules of the game. After the "Partial hit. You both inflict damage, roll the dice . . ." the MC would not say "What do you do now?" An MC who says that has failed to make a move. He must set up his "What do you do?" with a soft move. Something has to happen -- like "take their stuff" or "separate them" or "show signs of doom" or "offer an opportunity with a cost" or whatever. That creates a new situation which results in new decisions to make and new tactical choices. As long as both sides keep going back and forth and making their moves, the game goes well even if nobody is particularly descriptive. The MC doesn't have to be any more creative than a DM or GM in some other game -- the MC moves are all written down in the book, he can just use those. But, he has to make a move or the group isn't actually playing Dungeon World. <br/><br/>Further, I don't think that numerous sub-systems necessarily create more tactical complexity. Ironically, they might create less -- if a player is limited to actions for which there are specific rules, his options are more constrained even if there are lots and lots of rules. The neat thing in *W games is that pretty much no matter what a player does, if it matters, the rubber will meet the road in the form of a mechanical effect. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403729/#Comment_403729" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T09:47:21+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  9:47AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are define itely some players who crave numbers that DW doesn't always deliver.

I think it results in part from one of the things that bugs me about Dungeon World (and which isn't as much a problem in other *W games): despite everything I've written in this thread, Dungeon World DOES try to superfically mimic the "roll to hit/roll damage" procedure that happens in other more traditional games. So even though the Hack and Slash move in DW isn't REALLY "rolling to hit" -- or anyway, it's not the same as an attack roll in other games -- it does SEEM like it because Dungeon World has you "rolling damage" and deducting it from monster HP as if you are playing a traditional game. So, it's not at all surprising that a player might a) think they ARE playing a more traditional game (which they are less likely to think in Apocalypse World) and b) become annoyed that they don't have any obvious way to increase their "damage" or their "chance to hit." <br/><br/>I drift the rules a little when I run it and make all damage done to badguys entirely fictional. So, on a 10+ the player will stab the monster while successfully avoiding harm. Then, on my next soft move, I have to take the player's clear advantage into consideration. If there IS NO damage roll, then players don't feel cheated that they aren't getting a bonus to damage. This also mitigates the issue of rolling poorly on the damage dice -- it seems unfair to me that a player could roll a 10+ and then roll a 1 damage; that makes it so that combat always has two chances to fail. In my opinion a 10+ should be an objectively good thing -- not just a chance at a good thing.                            </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403739/#Comment_403739" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T11:52:41+00:00" title="January 15, 2013 11:52AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>AMB:</b> Yup.

I guess I've been thinking of the MC moves in a mechanical way -- like, in my mind, it's chess or checkersish -- the MC makes a move, then the player makes a move, there is a result, repeat. So, even though both "sides" have a limited number of possible move options, the interaction between the kinds of moves create endless tactical choices and outcomes. The book does a lot of codification about MC moves: when the MC makes them, what they should be, &amp;c., so it's not just freeform narration . . . but, of course, you're right, the MC moves ARE in the form of narration, and that "codification" I mentioned could easily be seen as the same "GM advice" that exists in plenty of other games, so when I argue, "come on! it's totally a tactical challenge!" it's definitely possible that I'm deluding myself . . . :P   <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403760/#Comment_403760" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T14:45:54+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  2:45PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Rolling your class damage die is the "core roll" so to speak, with H&amp;S coming in to play only when you need to establish position in the fight.</blockquote>\nThat is really interesting.

Is it just like "how you handle fictional positioning if it's a fight and things are crazy, so normal methods don't apply"?

You use fictional positioning and damage rolls until or unless it's a fight, then you roll H&amp;S. Like in <i>Poison'd</i>, for instance.<br/><br/>One dial to turn, which isn't explicit in DW I don't think, is when you don't roll damage and go straight to fictional harm. Like "Don't move or I slit your throat." You wouldn't roll damage in that case, right? (maybe go right to last breath or defy danger/con) So there's a good spectrum to dial on when you need it:<br/><br/>[fictional harm/last breath/defy danger(con)]---[roll damage]---[make a move first]<br/><br/>(To address the OP, the tactics involved obviously impact where that dial is pointed.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403778/#Comment_403778" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T21:02:24+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  9:02PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree with John.<br/><br/>The "hack and slash" move is somewhat like "when you try to deal damage to an enemy, but you're doing it under fire".<br/><br/>If you've got a good position, you can just hit them.<br/><br/>If they're threatening you, then you need to roll H&amp;S.<br/><br/>I wonder about a simplified damage system for DW, something like:<br/><br/>When you hack &amp; slash [...] roll+Str. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.<br/>* You deal your foe a nasty wound.<br/>* Your foe doesn't manage to make an attack against you at the same time.<br/>* You improve your position against your foe or outmaneuver them (or take +1 forward against them, if the fiction doesn't feel sufficient for you)<br/><br/>Then you either describe wounds narratively, or:<br/><br/>You have a damage rating, like in AW. Dealing a wound means you apply this rating against the enemy.<br/><br/>The monsters have hit points, or even simply a number of wounds ("A mountain Orc goes down after the second nasty wound...").<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not sure the hit points really add all that much to the system (on the monsters' side, at least - I can see some rationale for keeping hit points for the PCs, whether for game design reasons or nostalgia reasons).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403788/#Comment_403788" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T22:08:35+00:00" title="January 15, 2013 10:08PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hit points make conversion of D&amp;D materials super easy, too.<br/><br/>I played around with a version of H&amp;S like that, Paul, and one unfortunate side effect is choosing option 2 on a 7-9.
