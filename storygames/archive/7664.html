And you know that they want something. And you know what it is, but maybe not in great detail. Like a one-sentence blurb.<br/><br/>To begin with you don't know _anything_ else. You just have a vague idea of the genre and style of the game, like "1920s pulp space opera" or "prehistoric family drama, serious in tone".<br/><br/>What do you need to frame a good scene for this character? What helps most?<br/><br/>I'm looking particularly for brief, easy things, bits of information. Things that immediately give you an idea, or have in the past. For example, such a "thing" might be: <br/><br/>* "a one-sentence description of an interesting location", or <br/>* "a few genre tropes: like '<i>the scene of a grisly murder</i>' or '<i>a beautiful woman knocks on your door with a case for you to investigate</i>', if playing a detective noir film-type game, to choose from."<br/><br/>An example of an answer I'm not looking for would be, <br/><br/>* "It helps most to sit down with the player for two hours and have them fill out this AW30M3 questionnaire I made..." <br/><br/>But maybe that's what you do, and there's one question on your questionnaire that works really well, and, thinking back on it, is really the key... if so, tell me what it is!<br/><br/>What is a key element that, for you, would help frame a cool scene right away?

This implies making an assumption about what was the same before.<br/><br/>So, example:<br/><br/>Character is: a scoundrel who wants to clear his name of past crimes.<br/><br/>Genre is: Arabian Nights style fantasy.<br/><br/>Scene that comes to mind is: A "chance" meeting with a mysterious advocate, who has an offer...<br/><br/>Why did that come to mind? Because it changes something about the implied status quo in the character's blurb. Up until now, he's been suffering from a tarnished rep and an infamous name, until he meets someone who apparently wants to help him. Why? What's the catch?

What's at stake - something has to be able to change, some desire of Player for PC must be threatened or possibly achieved, some risk evoked etc.  <br/><br/>In V.Baker's Afraid proto-game the idea being "Players say what they intend and you move forward to where something interferes with them reaching that, they have the scene they are in effect requesting and you resolve it, or their request is met without being played and it's "so what then" or you "have something kick in door".  Even if it's as simple as "we explore the tunnel on the left", "cool, after 20 minutes of passing through disused dusty passages you come to [scene]".<br/><br/>In terms of picking the elements, I think for Characters this is:<br/><br/>- continuity demands (a story involves reincorporating elements), particulary if the scene is a "mid to later in game/adventure/story" one.<br/>&amp;<br/>- complication demands (if the Player created a lost love, okay I bring them into a scene but add someone now with them in an obviously intimate way as a complication) ~ this may be a new NPC, particularly if we are "early in game/adventure/story", there must be a certain amount of adversity from PC on PC struggle or from GM-sponsored NPC or "impersonal obstacle".<br/><br/>In the Mythic game's terms are you "bringing in an established thread from an earlier scene or from character creation/backstory" or are you "introducing a complication to a thread" or are you "introducing a whole new thread".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170294/#Comment_170294" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T11:41:23+00:00" title="September 20, 2008 11:41AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leonard, John K., and Danny,<br/><br/>Good stuff!

Or do you count stuff you invent on the fly as "things you need"?<br/><br/>A good thing to have (though not strictly necessary) is a relationship. If the character has a relationship to someone else, then I can frame a scene where that relationship is likely to change in some way. If he has an enemy, I could frame a scene where he needs something his enemy has in order to reach his goal. If he has a friend, I could frame a scene where the friend and the goal are opposed somehow.<br/><br/>But if this is the first scene (is it?), that's starting out with a bang, and it might be going way too fast. If it's the first scene, I'd just frame a scene of the character doing something defining for that character. If it's an action hero, she's action heroing, and if it's a psychologist, she's in session.

Those characters don't have to be overdefined, but the players have to know what angle of the situation they're coming in on ("I'm the captain of the insect-ship" / "I'm a captured slave on the insect-ship.").  If they don't they have to invent it as the very first thing they invent, before they start talking, which is IMO the same thing as a requisite for framining a scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170379/#Comment_170379" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T10:39:03+00:00" title="September 21, 2008 10:39AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Rob,<br/><br/>Very good point on the "when", and all the other stuff is great, too.

Is there anything more to that advice, or pretty much just what you wrote in that last sentence?</blockquote>\nMythic emulates a GM's plotting with a few mechanisms to create scenes and events.  Lists are maintained of all NPC's, keeping special onte of those considered important to PC's (family etc.), and Threads.  A thread is a "storyline", a main thread being the core issue of an adventure, others being the identity of a mysterious benefactor etc., and again track is kept of PC threads such as "find my lost sister" etc..<br/><br/>I think a key part of advice about threads is that even if playing with a GM and the GM is using this to spark themselves, adding new threads should be based on the players'/characters' interests.  Be player-focused in the storyline.<br/><br/>Overall it recommends a minimalist approach to setting up scenes and then fleshing them out in play.  Leave it at "in a warehouse" and if players want explosives to have stored there check the random answer chart to see if there are explosives in the warehouse etc.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
