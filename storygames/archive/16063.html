I\u2019d like to go into a little more depth on the topic.<br/><br/>In MA as I\u2019m reading it, part of play is the idea of zooming between scales: huge technological megastructures on the one hand and the minutia of dungeon crawling adventure on the other. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen this style of play before, and I\u2019m intrigued. I\u2019m going to talk about GM and player moves in this post. I mean these in the Apocalypse World sense of those moments where the GM and players engage the rules and fiction in specific ways.<br/><br/>Basic D&amp;D is a game that starts and stays zoomed down to the smallest scale of action. It starts at the entrance to the dungeon. The PCs proceed square-by-square, describing how they interact with the environment as they go.<br/><br/>Expert D&amp;D (like Metamorphosis Alpha) adds an outdoor scale to the game. As I imagine it, you\u2019re playing your expert game. You have a hex map of the campaign world showing the terrain in each hex as well as the locations of cities, dungeons, and other sites. When the players travel from one point to another, you examine your hex map. You roll random encounters. When an encounter occurs, you zoom down to the bottom and work out the details of the encounter. The rules for travel and random encounters determine when and where you zoom between scales. MA seems like it\u2019s supposed to work this way as well, although I think there\u2019s more going on as well (see below).<br/><br/>Dungeon World does something very similar with the \u201cdangerous journey\u201d move. It zooms you from a high level (e.g. \u201cthe road from Greyhawk to Droog\u201d) to a low level (what\u2019s happening to the PCs right now. Another interesting variant are the carousing rules that many OSR GMs use. They zoom from a high level (drinking at the Inn) to a low level (e.g. waking up in jail).<br/><br/>The Regiment is a game that has a full set of moves for each zoom level and mechanics that decide when, where, and how we transition between them. Engagement moves operate at the level of the battlefield. The results of the engagement moves determine the circumstances when we zoom down to the player moves. Note that the zoom is necessary. The context for the player moves only exists when you\u2019re zoomed in far enough to be talking about the details of the situation and how the characters are interacting with it. <br/><br/>All that is a long winded way to getting to talking about what\u2019s interesting in Metamorphosis Alpha. In MA, as I understand it, zooming scale is a value GM move that might be called for at various times during play with or without specific player actions. Here are a couple of examples:<br/><br/>You arrive at the "dungeon" you\u2019ve been travelling to (actually a 1 mile cube automated medical experimentation complex). It has multiple doors, windows (some broken), maybe a ladder to the roof, a giant gaping hold several floors tall a ways down the side, a big loading dock, and what looks like a hanger up one wall. This is the equivalent to arriving at the entrance to the dungeon and finding that it has 100 entrances. We're zoomed way out. <br/><br/>"What do you do?" The referee is looking for a cue to their next move. If the players just walk in the nearest door, then it\u2019s an invitation for the referee to zoom right down to the bottom then and there by describing the space the players have entered. However, the DM doesn\u2019t have to zoom at this point. \u201cThe place seems largely abandoned and terribly run down. You walk through several rooms, mostly stripped of furniture and goods. The place seems to go on forever. What next?\u201d Here the referee is staying zoomed pretty far out. Is this a valid tactic? Is it a good idea? I\u2019m not sure. It depends on the situation and what the PCs are doing there in the first place.<br/><br/>One of the PCs says \u201clet\u2019s look for some kind of reception desk, or a place where we could find a map.\u201d This sounds like a golden invitation for the GM to zoom right in on a specific situation. The player wants to zoom into somewhere that can get information. Alternately, a PC might say something like \u201cI start digging through the nearest locker for loot.\u201d Sounds like the character is making a move: that\u2019s an invitation to zoom down. Moves require context, which the GM needs to provide (there\u2019s been plenty of discussion on here about how moves go awry if you stay too vague and don\u2019t provide the context. \u201cOK,\u201d the GM says \u201cit looks like you\u2019re in some kind of abandoned operating theatre. There\u2019s a gaping hole in the roof where some kind of heavy equipment has been removed, but you spy a white storage locker lying on its side near the far wall.\u201d<br/><br/>The zoom can happen the other way too. \u201cWhen you step out of the elevator, you find yourself in a corridor about 200\u2019 square that extends ahead of you into the invisible distance. There are doors down both walls every 20\u2019 extending as far as you can see.\u201d A zoom out could be called for by actions that the PCs think quite innocuous or by an obvious attempt to move to a high level. \u201cLet\u2019s head up to the roof and see if we can see the general layout of this place.\u201d If you were doing this Apocalypse World style, you could even specific moves for it. I think that the move starting \u201cwhen you move to a good vantage point and try to grasp the essence of the place in one look\u201d could be MA\u2019s \u201copen your mind\u201d move. <br/><br/>A game like this calls for clear GM agenda and principles that tell them when and how to zoom. A good principle might be \u201cpaint a big picture but provide details,\u201d or \u201cmake the world vast.\u201d Driving play from the big picture down to the details of the situation is probably part of the agenda for a game like this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366127/#Comment_366127" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T18:36:30+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:36PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff, Tony!

Of all the million up-and-down trad game campaigns of my youth, the big "make or break the fun" question, in retrospect, seems to have been "What gets played?"  In other words, certain things need to be established, certain questions need to be answered, in order for the fiction to proceed -- but which ones do we roleplay out, with skill checks and talking in-character and whatnot?  The default logic of "it needs to get established, thus it needs to get played through in-character" made for many a boring session!<br/><br/>I know, playing through boring, dumb crap is old news.  Duh, when you do it, it sucks.  But I'm not talking about poor judgment on what matters in the fiction.  I'm talking about a legitimate discrepancy between what matters in the fiction and what's fun to play through in-character.<br/><br/>My big breakthrough was to view "in character" as "zoomed in", just the way you're talking about things here.  If you can zoom in, you can also zoom out.  You can establish the stuff that needs to be established but makes for dull roleplay, by zooming out!<br/><br/>Hopefully this background on how I came to this observation will explain the solution I chose: to have an explicit procedure for shifting the zoom on demand.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">It is made of purty colors.</a>  (The actual version I use in play is round, so everyone's facing it.  Bullet time in the center, episode summary at the outer edge.)<br/><br/>Simply spelling out that people have the right to zoom in or out, and giving them an easy way to signal their desires on this front, has helped some players quite a bit.  I don't know if this style of communication would fit in nicely with Metamorphosis Alpha or not, but I figured you might find it interesting.  The GM doesn't need to remember or wonder or keep track of when a player is doing something that might deserve a zoom-in or zoom-out; the info is right there on the table for all to see.<br/><br/>I'd guess that using different mechanics (grabbing different dice, announcing different moves) at different zoom scales could serve as a similar signal, given the establishment of similar expectations.<br/><br/>Some neat things I've seen emerge from this:  Given Delve's emphasis on in-character decision-making, each speed (a.k.a. zoom) has its own degrees of certainty, agency, and consequence.  Zoomed-out modeling is more of an approximation, and thus more of a crapshoot.  If you want the maximum control that comes with the ability to customize responses to every development and variable, you zoom in.  At the same time, zoomed-out modeling can resolve more things at once, re-writing your fictional position more meaningfully, while a zoomed-in resolution might be just "you dodged that slash".<br/><br/>I hope this isn't derailing.  I didn't see a specific question in your post, so I figured this was an opportunity to rant on zooms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366167/#Comment_366167" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T00:48:12+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 12:48AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This kind of zooming has definitely been a part of our <i>Stars without Number</i> play. Both in time and space. We have had several instances of "you have encountered a massive structure in which you can explore", which is handled by strategic level description "There exists these routes between where you are, and where you want to be" then zooming down to room and corridor detail at critical junctures "There's this room, with these exits, and cyberzombies, here, here, and over here." It's all worked out very well to provide a sense of immense scale without bogging us down.<br/><br/>Then there's the "this voyage takes two weeks, what projects are you working on" vs the in the moment roleplaying of tense negotiations, and then down to "bullet time" when there is no other choice but fight.<br/><br/>David Berg, I like the idea of having an explicit diagram like that to drive play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366439/#Comment_366439" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T14:30:50+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  2:30PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an element of GMing craft, I rate "zooming" skills very highly.

They'd wonder why we weren't thrilled by the appearance of some new and exotic creature, but is was simply because we were bored of the framing structure (again, we didn't think of those specific terms twenty odd years ago).<br/><br/>My paradigm always thought of good GMing as cinematic. A mix of scenes, with varying action types, some characterisation, a few changes of tempo to shake things up a bit, and some skipping over the boring bits to get to the next interesting stuff. It's just always the way I rolled, if someone looked like they were getting bored it was time to change the way the scenes were presented, change the types of actions necessary to proceed or change the level of zoom. <br/><br/>Now I consider that a fruitful void for GM interaction with the evolving storyline; personally if these ideas were codified, it'd lose some of the magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366497/#Comment_366497" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T22:41:05+00:00" title="March 10, 2012 10:41PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys.  If you ever want to use the dial, drop me a line and I can send you a printer-friendly version.<br/><br/>I think those pre-session AW moves (<i>wealth</i>, <i>fortune</i>, etc.) are a great example of zooming out to establish broad situation, which can then be refined into specific situations to fit the needs of the game as play proceeds.  I notice that veteran players of stakes-setting games always do this: "Win the statue and be recognized as its rightful owner"/"Earn the hatred of the city guards" are fertile and flexible and ongoing in ways that "Win the statue"/"A guard stabs you" are not.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about AW's implementation is the regular checks on broad situation (once per session) and the way they fit into the broad<i>est</i> situation of "I'm a Hocus" or "I'm a Hardholder".  It's no coincidence that these are my two favorite character types.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
