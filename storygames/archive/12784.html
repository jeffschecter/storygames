Forgive my non-familiarity with non-North-American names. I'm going to assume that I am.<br/><br/>So I gotta tell you, Arvid. Your post reminds me a whole lot of a pretty infamous post by Jonathan Tweet. It's since been taken down, but here's an excerpt posted on John Kim's livejournal (<a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/68900.html" rel="nofollow">full entry here</a>):\n<blockquote><cite>These are Jonathan Tweet's words</cite><br/>Roleplaying, as currently construed, appeals disproportionately to guys because it's mostly about the things that men evolved to enjoy: hunting and warfare. It's about a group assembling to undertake (imaginary) risks for glory and dominance. It's the same reason that team sports, such as basketball, are more male, whereas women compete to be judged beautiful and worthy (ice skating, gymnastics). TCGs are even more male-oriented than RPGs as they're about direct conflict with little to no story or personality. When I was in Finland 5 years ago, the TCG players were typified as guys without girlfriends. LARPing has more female appeal because it's more about personalities, relationships, clothing, and make-up. Finally, the quality of gamer men is a factor. A Finnish gamer I met said she got into gaming as a way to meet good-looking guys. The US gaming scene has less to offer along those lines.</blockquote>\nNow, I'll admit that this line of thought pisses me off. But because:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arvid</cite>there isn't any real research behind this. Just me writing from the top of my head.</blockquote>\n...I'm making an effort to not be snarky. If my response sounds snarky, I apologize. This subject is admittedly one of my Internet Crazy Buttons.<br/><br/>First off, speaking as a breasted gamer, let me just postulate that one of the reasons why women aren't exactly flocking to play D&amp;D and other more trad games is because the rampant chainmail bikini porn and deprotagonized depictions of women just don't make us feel women. Why would we want to engage in a hobby whose promotional material very clearly sends the message that YOU ARE ONLY WELCOME FOR THE TITILLATION YOUR BODY PARTS PROVIDE FOR REAL (READ: MALE) GAMERS. Granted. Some of us grit our teeth and forge onward anyhow. I'm not going to claim that I'm wearing a hat of Speaking For All Women. (It doesn't exist.) But I can tell you from talking to other female gamers that I'm not the only one that feels this way.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think you'll find that the concentration of female gamers in the indie community is significantly higher than it is in trad roleplaying circles. Hell, the indie community has female GAME DESIGNERS in a much, much higher concentration than will be found in trad circles. Similarly, there is a much higher percentage of female gamers in other areas of gaming outside of tabletop. Women can be found in much higher numbers in console gaming, MMOs, and CCGs in particular. So looking only at trad tabletop roleplaying and saying "WHY DO WIMMINZ HATEZ THE GAMING YO?" is perhaps a flawed approach.<br/><br/>We're here. If you're genuinely interested in understanding what females gamers are thinking, then I might suggest checking out <a href="http://rpgirl-zine.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">RPG = Role Playing Girl</a>. It's a zine that was first published in 2009, with a followup edition this past year in 2010, that is fully written, laid out, and produced by women about women in gaming. There's some fantastic stuff here written by lots of really smart people who are all women and who are all engaged in gaming. I encourage you to take a look.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'll say what I always say whenever the question of "how can we make games that women will play?" comes up.<br/><br/>DON'T TRY TO.<br/><br/>I mean, come on. I loves me some killing things and taking their things. I loves me console action RPGs, and zombies, and dungeon-delving. Does this make me "masculine"?

(THIS IS HOW WOMEN ARE) In my post, I assert that these qualities are not how men truly and biologically <i>are</i> (and thus how women are not), but rather that they are associated with masculinity, and thus there are heavy expectations in today's society that men should be like this, women should not.<br/><br/>I agree on the chainmail bikini. If I were to write a more complete post on gender in roleplaying demographics, I wouldn't be able to neglect it like I did in my post.<br/><br/>I agree on the indie demographics. (I've edited my post slightly to make this clearer)<br/><br/>I agree on not making girly games.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is, basically, "You don't need to make girly games, you just need to realize that your trad games are encoded with masculinity". And by masculinity I don't mean "male gene stuff", but rather society's expectations on what guys are and what guys like. (Chainmail bikinis and all) I guess that's what Marshall Burns is getting at when he says that male (a sex) is not the same thing as masculine.

It's been my observation that women overall like pretty much the same things in games that men do, but the misogyny in some gaming communities and the constant straight male gaze in role-playing art really drives them away from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287617/#Comment_287617" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T14:09:52+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  2:09PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2010 2:13PM by lachek.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            :shrug:<br/><br/>Arvid, I enjoyed your post. I think it's fair to say that D&amp;D has, if not defined, at least heavily <i>informed</i> 90% of all role-playing game designs since, and starting the conversation on that level - what did this extremely influential game do to shape the future market for our hobby - is not a bad thing. As an exploratory post designed to elicit responses and further thinking on the subject, I think you're bang on. Clearly you've already elicited some pretty strong reactions and, hopefully, thinking.<br/><br/>I game with a large proportion of women and have some empirical observations and anecdotes I could share. One of these is that most women in gaming do play D&amp;D. Whether this is because the game system is, in fact, not at all hostile to a feminine persuasion, or if it is because that's how almost <i>everyone</i> gets into the hobby and where almost <i>everyone</i> remains, I cannot say for sure. But I do know that when members in our extended gaming community organize combat-heavy games of D&amp;D, GURPS, Twilight 2000 or whatever, none of our female members start jumping for joy and shout "memememe!". But when one of them pitched a Primetime Adventures game using Vampire: the Masquerade as the setting, they all got excited, and now I'm Producing the game for three women and one guy (who ironically but entirely characteristically tries to adopt the role of "their saviour").<br/><br/>I bought Apocalypse World primarily for my wife, who loves apocalyptic fiction and stabbing people in the face. She's drooling over the character books right now. She also loves zombies, and is looking forward to the new edition of Dead Weight using the AW rules (hint hint, Daniel). She played DnD 4E for about two sessions before she decided the system was fine and everything, but she just didn't care for the continuous monster slaying and wish fulfillment as a payoff, and couldn't give a crap about going up a level so she could choose between the Feat That Makes Her Kill Everything In A Five Yard Circle or the Feat That Makes Her Grapple Move Way Cooler.<br/><br/>Of course, all of the above is entirely anecdotal. I much prefer to get actual females - as Anna puts it, members of the breasted persuasion - to give feedback on this stuff rather than have a sausage party sit around and idly speculate. Unfortunately, women are exactly as incompetent as men when it comes to <i>thinking about and explaining what they like</i> (rather than that they "just like it"), and furthermore - in my experience - they tend to be fucking sick of talking about gender and RPGs because that's <i>all they ever get asked about</i> and they <i>just want to play games dammit</i>. Combine that with the fact that there are a lot fewer of them in the hobby to being with, and you have a pretty difficult situation where it's near impossible to draw reasonable statistical conclusions. I suspect, Arvin, even if you <i>could</i> leverage Facebook to check for Fan status, your results would be skewed because most women who like RPGs, much like the men, only play (or even know of) D&amp;D to begin with.<br/><br/>This <i>necessitates</i> actually thinking critically about this issue, rather than just listening to a few loud voices due to the presence of a statistical void. And Arvin, I think you're raising some fine points, that ought to be deconstructed and explored.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287618/#Comment_287618" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T14:17:48+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  2:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2010 2:24PM by chearns.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>If you're genuinely interested in understanding what females gamers are thinking, then I might suggest checking out <a href="http://rpgirl-zine.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">RPG = Role Playing Girl</a>.

This is trying to only identify ways in which I love AW that feel like they might be tied to my gender: this has nothing to do with all of the other reasons I love it, so please don't think this is a total list of AW's fantasticness.<br/><br/>- Gender ambiguity is a given in Apocalypse World. You don't see women as being feared or othered; there are classes that are feared and othered, and other than the Battlebabe (which I've seen played male, and played myself) gender is never really implied. I've played the only female Angel I've seen. I LOVE that the Angel splash image is of a cool-ass looking man of color. <br/><br/>- Gender ambiguity in the name choices. I was a chick named Lafferty; Matt Wilson played a badass chopper dude named Diamond. Joe's Girl was a guy. The way everything subtly stresses that in Apocalypse World, EVERYTHING is messed up and fucked, I feel like it gives me the freedom to be whatever the hell I want. Shreyas played a gender-ambiguous Skinner that actually had a threesome with two other characters, who were never entirely sure of the Skinner's gender even during sex. Amazing. I can be anything I want, and more than that, I don't even have to fucking CHOOSE if I don't want to. It's fucking APOCALYPSE WORLD. There are more pressing issues than what's going on in my pants.<br/><br/>- The live playtesting groups were overwhelmingly female. Vincent listened hard to everything his playtesters had to say (much harder than I would have if I were D. Vincent Baker, which is probably why I am <i>not</i> D. Vincent Baker). I don't know if any of the things me or Em or Meg or Julia or the lovely woman who played Dust and whose name I forget said had anything to do with our vajayjays, but we were heard and then some. I still sometimes have pangs of guilt over things that Vincent changed that I suggested, because who am I to mess with his masterpiece? (A playtester, but you know how it is.) <br/><br/>- And dude? Did you see the dedication in the front of the book? "For Meguey. The rest of you are just lucky." Meg is one of the coolest, most self-possessed, brightest feminists I know. I was completely fucking clueless about gender issues before I met her, because until recently I didn't feel that they'd really impacted my life. The fact that this whole game is a love letter to one of the neatest woman gamers I know is enough to make the game appealing to me. Now, I'm not always in agreement with Meg about stuff, but! The fact that this game was made for <b>a</b> woman I respect and admire probably has a lot to do with why <b>many</b> women enjoy the game.<br/><br/>- Also I got to fire a machine gun into a waiting army while hanging off the side of a hollowed-out school bus.

One of the first games my wife and I ever played with our current group of gamers, and which really sold her on the idea of "story games", was Spirit of the Century. In this game she played a con wo/man named "Greasy Jean/Gene" whose one and only defined Aspect before the game began was "He or She?". We never did figure out what gender s/he was, but in the end s/he beat my character (a female car mechanic turned crime fighter) to a pulp, ate my eyeball, and sold me into prostitution. Yeah, it was an unorthodox game of SotC.<br/><br/>So Elizabeth, forgive me if this is a clueless (or indeed offensive) question, but based on this anecdote (anecdotes are all we have, unfortunately) and your preferences, do you believe that this aspect might be something that appeals to many women in a role-playing game - being able to ignore or indeed transcend gender roles, to play a man or a woman or indeed a transgendered person, to enter a world where you can choose to have any gender identity yet have that choice not make an impact whether on the game's mechanics nor its fiction? If so, what does this say about games which choose - typically in the name of "realism" - to alter the options available for female player characters? I'm not talking about anything as extreme as FATAL, but I recall even a game like Guardians of Order's rendition of Game of Thrones - a fiction series very popular among women - mentioned in a call-out box that while female PCs were not discouraged, they can expect to be the subject of massive discrimination, especially if engaging in trades normally occupied by men.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287698/#Comment_287698" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T17:47:16+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  5:47PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikael, I think that makes sense.

Sometimes it's just easier to say "fuck it I'm playing a male character rather than get kidnapped/raped one more time". But gender-bending has its problems too. I once had a GM in a D&amp;D campaign that refused to let me play a male character. He would let me play a frickin' astral deva, but he wouldn't let me play a man. Because, you know, I couldn't play a man convincingly. Because I was a women. (But a freakin' celestial being was just fine.) Canonical sexism like what Elizabeth referenced with Exalted is one of the reasons why I women who I have talked to will play cross-gender characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287709/#Comment_287709" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T18:16:19+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  6:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2010 7:10PM by lachek.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><a href="http://karenhealey.livejournal.com/781085.html" rel="nofollow">Mansplaining</a>.</blockquote>\nThat's the most offensive term I've heard in a long time.

Not so comfortable with you referring to our gender as "breasted" (I think there are more important things to us than that, and considering what an epidemic breast cancer is, it's sort of like you're discounting a whole segment of women as not-women when you do that).<br/><br/>That said.<br/><br/>On the one hand, Arvid, I think you're onto something because a good chunk of the stuff you mention about D&amp;D is stuff that I'm not a fan of, and all of the stuff you mention about Apocalypse World I fucking love. AW is my very favorite game, period.<br/><br/>However, the thing that you're missing is how<i>extremely similar</i>Apocalypse World is to D&amp;D. Class-based structures? Check. Hierarchical structure\u2014 "The MC will tell you what!" when you fail in Apocalypse World. D&amp;D is about conflict, but man, have you ever played AW? It is ALL about conflict. There's been more backstabbing in my games of AW than I ever saw in D&amp;D. And relationships are kind of a moot point: every game that has more than two players is a "relationship game." The types of relationships may be different, but every character in a game has a relationship with the characters they interact with. That is the heart of roleplaying itself.</blockquote>\nOkay, yes. You're absolutely right.<br/><br/>(First of all, I'd like to just point out that I picked AW because that's <i>my</i> favourite game as well. I could do a comparison with a story game as well, but whatever)<br/><br/>I can't argue that there are classes in AW, but I definitly think AW is based more on individual relationships than an edition of D&amp;D. In D&amp;D you pick your class in a group with a specified purpose: Go into dungeons, kill stuff, loot them. In AW, you pick a class, and <i>from the classes relationships</i> with each other and individual NPCs, play emerges. What the individual PCs are, and what their relationship to each other are determines what the game is about, the book is even very clear about how you should drive wedges between PCs, that is, make individual relationships, not adressing the individuals as part of a group.<br/><br/>And I <i>do</i> feel there is a lesser authority in Story Games and AW than in traditional games. Yes, the MC will tell you what, but the MC is also a fan of your character. The MC does not make up a story before hand and punishes the players for straying from it. The MC does not have the final say and all the knowledge of the game world. The MC's moves are designed to affirm and build on the players' input.<br/><br/>And yes, violence.<br/><br/>But you're also agreeing on a good chunk of this, and that's cool.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should downplay these gender stereotypes and go straight for the autism-like systemizing and obsessing that is also present in these issues. (For instance, violence is a system and a competition, not something meaningfull) Yeah, it's pretty mean to call the roleplaying hobby slightly autistic too, but I feel that hits closer to the heart of the matter.<br/><br/>Thanks for both your answers!<br/><br/>(I have a post in planning that will also touch on the gender ambiguities of AW.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clint Krause</cite><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>However, the thing that you're missing is how<i>extremely similar</i>Apocalypse World is to D&amp;D.

If anything, this post could be considered a part of <i>that</i> series. It's called "an interplay model of roleplaying" in the tag field. It's a critique of traditional gaming, and a proponent for improv and flow concepts in roleplaying. You can definitly be a "story gamer" and find something interesting there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287742/#Comment_287742" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T00:10:22+00:00" title="August 20, 2010 12:10AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2010 12:14AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arvid</cite> I'd like roleplaying to be gender neutral.</blockquote>I'd like roleplaying to be <i>gender positive</i>; having players of both genders is an asset to the gaming. Having playable characters of both genders is an asset. Investigating the masculine and the feminine will always be an interesting side of roleplaying. Investigating being straight and gay is interesting too. <br/><br/>As a game-smith I find it my responsibility to make games which are open to players of as many persuasions as possible. Making a fantasy-world for a game leaves me with full power to open up the playing field. There is no excuse for ignoring such possibilities in frpgs. We need more game-smiths to cater for the rich possibilities which lays within the frame of "being human".<br/><br/>So, to me "women in gaming" is one side of a a big and important question; how do we make <i>inclusive</i> games? How do we invite our players into the game? What kind of humanity do we communicate to them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287744/#Comment_287744" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T00:36:01+00:00" title="August 20, 2010 12:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arvid, wow, I'm impressed with how you're handling the dialogue here.

To my eye, your post suffered when it delved into the typical "story games are better than D&amp;D-ish games" stuff.  And then you went on to cite a game which (as Elizabeth pointed out) is fundamentally a D&amp;D-ish game.<br/><br/>Also, when I read the title of your post, "why don't women play roleplaying games?" I mentally answered "They do."</blockquote>\nI can't comment on Apocalypse World because I haven't read or played it.  <br/><br/>However, a few comments on other things.  Regarding story games...  I've been at a number of story gamer gatherings, including the story games circle at GenCon, Go Play Northwest a few times, and local northern California gatherings.  I find that women make up about 10% to 20% of the participants.  That's about the same as the percentage at local, mostly-traditional conventions such as Pacificon, and matches statistics about GenCon SoCal and the general gamer population survey done by WotC in 1998.  I find that LARPs tend to have slightly higher female participation.  LARP events at local cons as well as general participation at Knutepunkt was more like 25% to 35% women.  The highest fraction of women I've seen at role-playing gamer gatherings is AmberCon NorthWest, which has been around 40% to 45% women. I'd be curious if it is different for the East Coast gatherings (story game or otherwise).  <br/><br/>So in my observation, at least, the features of story games don't seem to create a significantly larger female audience than traditional tabletop RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287747/#Comment_287747" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T01:22:04+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  1:22AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Arvid, wow, I'm impressed with how you're handling the dialogue here.

Other games may be purposely designed to appeal to a given gender, even going so far as to alienate the other(s), and that's okay - as long as these games are in the minority, and available to roughly equal degrees, rather than occupying the vast marketshare and being heavily weighted towards a male audience.<br/><br/>What games do you know of that actively highlight gender issues in a positive way?

That includes feminism, by the way, indeed anything that treats 'gender' as important... the last time it mattered to me which gender I happen to be, I needed to find a public restroom. (As it was, I ended up in the disabled one, which was unisex, but that's another and boring story.)<br/><br/>Why do some people find gender so important? More important than any other expression of their genome: handedness, hair or skin colour, whatever? It's the individual PERSON that is the important thing... the colour of their eyes and the like are just descriptors, a part of what makes them them and not someone else.<br/><br/>I've been role-playing since 1977, and matters of gender rarely if ever come into it (unless you count the first time I arrived at the university wargames club, where the early role-players met, and they were rather surprised that a woman had come in!). I play male and female characters, some have been straight and others gay. I've played alien races, fantasy races, humans with different colours of hair, skin and eyes to mine... 'cos it's ROLE-PLAYING. It would be rather dull if I never played anything but a 51-year-old female human with long grey hair and a talent at making computers go. I do that in real life. Role-playing is all about exploring the different, which is one of the reasons I hang out here, because story gaming can support that kind of exploration, and gives me tools to take back to the core of role-playing, whatever ruleset is being used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287783/#Comment_287783" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T06:38:58+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  6:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gender is important because it's one of the things that human societies use to organize themselves and one of the ways that people understand themselves.  If there were different expectations for the left-handed moiety and the right-handed moiety, or for the blue-eyed moiety and the brown-eyed moiety, if your experiences growing up were predicated on your handedness or your eye color, they'd be as important as gender.  But we don't expect brown-eyed kids to play with dolls while we expect blue-eyed kids to play with trucks and guns.  We don't expect left-handed kids to grow up to be doctors and lawyers and right-handed kids to grow up to be homemakers and teachers.<br/><br/>Megan, your experience at making computers go, if it's anything like the experience of many women I've known, is riddled with gender assumptions.  One of my oldest friends is a top-notch network engineer -- and I mean top-notch, as in the bandwidth of the network her team is responsible for is measured in terabytes, and she's the second most senior person on the team after the manager.  When she answers the phone for her workgroup, people who should know better assume she's the secretary and ask to talk to an engineer.  When people are considered for promotions, someone from HR always says "she's a woman, and there are few women senior engineers."  In one sense, sure, her XX chromosome configuration is just a descriptor.  But at the same time, even in a situation where it should be completely irrelevant, in an engineering profession where job performance can be measured in almost completely objective terms, her gender means that she has a dramatically different experience than her male colleagues do.  And as we are in part the sum of our experiences -- the factors going into what makes her who she is are factors that I simply cannot experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287786/#Comment_287786" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T06:42:58+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  6:42AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2010 6:58AM by lachek.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>So in my observation, at least, the features of story games don't seem to create a significantly larger female audience than traditional tabletop RPGs.</blockquote>\nHi John, thanks for your observations. It's nice to have some actual numbers to work with.<br/><br/>However, I'm led to a slightly different conclusion than you: that the <i>communities</i> of story gamers don't seem to <i>attract</i> a significantly larger female audience than traditional tabletop RPGs, but that the communities formed around games like LARPs and Amber DRPG do. Going back to my earlier assertion, most role-players, male or female, stick to the game and the community through which they were introduced to the hobby in the first place. Simply based on the fact that due to the lack of mainstream industry marketing most people are exposed to the hobby through friend referrals, it's easy to draw the conclusion that communities who already have a lot of female members will tend to gain a larger proportion of female members than other communities, regardless of the products they're centred around.<br/><br/>Actually, at least on the surface, there are a <i>lot</i> more similarities between D&amp;D and Primetime Adventures than there is between D&amp;D and Vampire: the Requiem LARP, or even Amber DRPG. Watch an ongoing game of D&amp;D and PTA, and you will likely see people sit around a table, talk in character, talk out of character, pass little tokens around, draw cards / rolling dice and go Oooh! and Aaah! at the results, laugh, and eat Cheetoes. Watch a game of Amber DRPG and you will see people sit around a table, talk most always in character or in narrative language, maybe get up and act out a scene spontaneously, rarely if ever break character or munch on Cheetoes. To an outsider, a game of Amber or V:tR LARP might seem closer to improv acting, while a game of D&amp;D or PTA looks more like social night with a rousing game of Sorry.<br/><br/>The play procedures of Amber and LARPs might lend themselves better to attracting women than the play procedures of D&amp;D or PTA, but as role players aware of game design we know that, deeper down, the difference between most games of V:tR and D&amp;D is mostly that V:tR is acted out while standing up and wearing makeup. Questions of narrative authority, for example, might be important - feminists all agree that there is such a thing as a "female narrative", to my understanding, and thus games which leave the narrative up to a single individual who is with 95% certainty male might discourage women from such games. I'm quite interested in exploring these questions further, from a game mechanics perspective.<br/><br/>Yeah, let's merge a "System Does Matter" thread with a "Women and Gaming" thread.

Hi this thread! I like you, cause I like talking about gender. And how it relates to my hobby of roleplaying.<br/><br/>As far as my female gaming taste goes: I'll play anything. Really. I like all different kinds of games for all different kinds of reasons, and none of them have to do with my gender's/sex's relationship to that game. They're a matter of personal taste. I like violence, horror, rolling dice, intrigue, action, fantasy, sci-fi, white wolf, warhammer, burning wheel and cyberpunk. I usually play women (I've never played a long term game as a man). My tastes have nothing to do with how much "relationship drama" is in a game or how much "dice rolling" there is in a game or how welcoming that game is to my gender/sex. I would prefer more gender equality in my gaming, but I'd prefer that in my movie watching too (among other things).<br/><br/>As far as how to design for women: So I recently interviewed game designer Jessica Hammer for RPGirl (that zine that is totally relevant to this discussion that everybody should check out because it talks about these things in depth and on many levels that are really informative.) She said something that I think is awesome about designing toward gender equality in games, so I'll share it here: "Recognize that you are not going to treat women fairly in your game unless you make a specific, concerted effort to do so. You are not exempt from this if you're a woman, if you're a feminist, or if you don't think you're biased. The research clearly shows that both men and women unconsciously discriminate against women. If you don't actively work to counteract your subconscious biases, your game will treat women in an unfair way, and that in turn will tell female players and GMs that they're not truly welcome." <br/><br/>As far as discussing this further: Yes please! I think that games like AW and Kagematsu and How We Came to Live Here (according to Jason Morningstar's ravings on storygames) are really neat cause they're diving right into that whole gender/sex (literally sex for AW) discussion. There are all kinds of people active in the gaming community who represent and identify with all kinds of genders. I think its awesome that gaming is so innovative in the ways its beginning to treat gender, and how some games have treated it in the past (re: cyberpunk + vampire as trad games that come to mind as dealing with gender). <br/><br/>If I ever get around to writing My Game, gender will definitely be a thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287793/#Comment_287793" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T07:26:04+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  7:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite><br/>As far as how to design for women: So I recently interviewed game designer Jessica Hammer for RPGirl (that zine that is totally relevant to this discussion that everybody should check out because it talks about these things in depth and on many levels that are really informative.)

"But I don't like Math, it's hard!" says one woman, again with all the women around her vigorously nodding their heads, while John rolls his eyes.<br/><br/><br/>-- System may matter, but what matters more is nutting up and inviting more women from outside the hobby (work, hobbies, etc) to play in your game.<br/>* Jerry Grayson is a paragon of this. He's just a really social guy, who people just can't help but to gush around, totally unashamed about his hobby.<br/>How so? Basically all the women around him that play, all the people he brings with him to GenCon, he personally invited into the hobby. Usually co-workers and the like, he'd just be like, "Hey, what are you doing Friday? You need to come over to my place and play some games with my friends." BOOM. New player. He even met his wife this way.<br/>I asked one of his (mostly female, or even male) friends after another, many of which just have the appearance of hipster club kids, how they got into the hobby. "I work with Jerry. A few weeks after I started working there, Jerry told me I need to come to his place to play games. I never played an RPG before. We played some superhero games, and I've been playing almost every week since."<br/>The fucker is a paragon of getting new people into gaming. Partly is the fact that he has zeeeeero shame about the hobby, partly that he's just a real social, laid back, fun guy. <br/>He alone has gotten more women into the hobby as permanent players, rollin' 20s, than any attempts by designers to create gender-neutral/friendly designs. It's basically a testament to the simple act of Inviting Friends Outside the Hobby to Play.<br/><br/>-- A funny story from Renee (Jerry's wife), I'll likely get the details confused: One of Renee's friends invited her and Jerry to some kind of couples gaming night thing: A bunch of gamers and their wives in a regular house game. So they went over: Renee was greeted by the friend, and was told that basically the men go into the dining room to play their games, while the women all go into the living room to knit and talk; she started leading Renee over to the living room. Renee was like, "Fuck that, I'm here to kill some orcs!", and joined the men at the kitchen table. She was more than a little horrified by all the unspoken assumptions from that experience.<br/><br/>Again, random thoughts, each triggered by some post in this thread.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287804/#Comment_287804" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T07:58:09+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  7:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2010 8:00AM by lachek.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Renee was greeted by the friend, and was told that basically the men go into the dining room to play their games, while the women all go into the living room to knit and talk; she started leading Renee over to the living room.

And that was probably the best ratio we've seen there yet.<br/><br/>As a shocking aside, not <i>one</i> of them played in either of my two sessions of Love in the Time of Sei\xf0.  <i>Even though it's got "Love" right in the game's title!</i><br/><br/>I've been grousing about not getting to play more often with women for a few years now.  75-100% of my players in the early eighties were women (well, girls anyway).  The games?  Uber-violent D&amp;D and The Fantasy Trip.  Thirty years later with things like Polaris, PTA, Kagematsu &amp; 1001 Nights on the docket I can almost never find female players.<br/><br/>I've never been to Ambercon yet even though it's only fifteen minutes from my house.

A woman can describe her experience, and a man can understand what she says; and vice versa. Human beings have this awesome ability/feat/move called "Put Yourself in Someone's Shoes." It goes like this:<br/><br/>When you want to really understand another person, roll +listening (i.e. roll 2d6 plus your listening attribute). <br/>On a 10+ you get it, well enough to summarize what the other person is saying in totally different words, and in such a way that this person nods his or her head and says, "Yeah that's right. That's what I think and feel." Improve your knowledge of that person by +1.<br/>On a 7-9, you think you understand, but when you try to summarize what you think you heard, the person you're listening to says you got part of it wrong, or missed out on something else he or she was trying to say. Take +1 on your next interaction with that person.<br/>On a miss, you don't even finish listening, you just nod your head and interrupt him or her as soon as possible in order to tell them your opinion. The MC gets to make as hard a move as he or she likes.<br/><br/>In other words, underneath the skin and meat and all the different experiences people have, men and women are basically human, and this common core of humanity, which they share, is what really matters to us in the end. Games have to address that common humanity if they're going to mean anything, and that's why men and women both enjoy playing awesome games. Therefore, really listening to one another is not only useful, it's absolutely essential to solving real problems like sexism. And it actually, truly, definitely works.<br/><br/>Also, as we have seen in this thread, there is no one way that all women (or all men) approach games. It is a mistake to draw too many generalized conclusions about all woman from what individual women say. So, we have to listen, understand, and repeat, over and over, learning new things every time until we die. Sometimes, the key to good listening is first to speak up on a particular topic -- even if you're wrong about it -- hear what people say, and then share your improved understanding. If your intention is to learn, then whatever you say will lead to something good, no matter how "wrong" it is at first.<br/><br/>On related topic -- lots of men enjoy talking about women: why they behave this way or that, and so forth. But one thing that men ought to talk about a lot more is why we ourselves behave this way or that. So many of us just take it for granted that "manly things" are "masculine" because of our hormones and muscles and hunter-gatherer-genes and whatnot. I'd like to see more games that explore what men are really all about in a way that questions traditional ideas of what masculinity means -- that is, how the characteristics of a man's body change (or do not change) how he should or should not behave. Sometimes we may find that the traditional view of masculinity has advantages; often we will find something different which works better -- either way, the exploration of it must yield valuable results.<br/><br/>If men really come to understand themselves better, they'll be able to go a lot farther in understanding women too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287843/#Comment_287843" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T10:24:36+00:00" title="August 20, 2010 10:24AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>A funny story from Renee (Jerry's wife), I'll likely get the details confused:</blockquote>\nOh yeah, I've been in that situation too.  A female friend and I met some board gamers at a con - two male-female couples.  It turned out they lived only a few miles from me (more from my friend, but she doesn't mind distance driving), and so they invited us to their next game night.  Awesome, I thought.<br/><br/>So we got there, and we ordered pizza for dinner.  There were two topics of conversation at the table: board games and knitting.  I participated in both, as I'm a somewhat experienced knitter.  Then we cleaned up the pizza boxes, and the women (except for my friend) went into the living room because one of them wanted to show the others her knitting - and I went along, because it sounded like they were serious technical knitters.  When I stepped through that door it was *clear* I was not welcome to be there where Girl Stuff was going on, and so I beat a retreat to the kitchen where they were taking out a board game.  And my friend was there, and she has the knack of being totally clueless about things she does not want to notice -- but it was clear that she was going against the pattern, that they really had expected her to go talk about Girl Stuff in the living room and weren't quite sure why she was in the kitchen playing board games.<br/><br/>It was just such a bizarrely awkward situation.  I felt like I had fallen into an episode of Leave it to Beaver, but with vegan pizza -- since this was, after all, Northampton, Massachusetts, in 2004 or 2005.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287881/#Comment_287881" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T12:35:46+00:00" title="August 20, 2010 12:35PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Megan</cite>Why do some people find gender so important?</blockquote>I believe most people recognize that gender really is important.

The fact that humans have two different genders, and different sexual orientations, tells me gender will continue to be important in the future.<br/><br/>Other parts of us are important too.

I'm a man, though, and have never doubted it. ;-)<br/><br/>As a designer I like to make games for <i>humans</i> to get into, but part of that is thinking about how men and women relate to each other in my games (both characters and players). Courting and relationships between men and women, is at the heart of most cultures. Making modern games is easy; I just take for granted that the players share most of my cultural codes (and they do, mostly). Working on my fantasy game Fabula, I have to take greater care what I do; how I build the culture, how I communicate it to the players, and how it relate to their own culture. Gender issues are at the heart of all this.<br/><br/>The one exception is my game <i>Muu</i> ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Maybe a game like Tomas' Muu is instead designed to be gender positive, highlighting, celebrating, actively exploring and creating synergy from the differences between sexes and/or gender roles (though, given the conceit of Allmuu, that seems an unlikely goal for that game?).</blockquote><i>Muu</i> is totally genderless, and is meant to be. Don't ask me why. Muu sprang into existence a spring night in -89, and I was but the creative vessel for its birth. I do not understand half of what <i>Muu</i> is about, but I know it is not about gender.

It's nice to have some actual numbers to work with.<br/><br/>However, I'm led to a slightly different conclusion than you: that the<i>communities</i>of story gamers don't seem to<i>attract</i>a significantly larger female audience than traditional tabletop RPGs, but that the communities formed around games like LARPs and Amber DRPG do. Going back to my earlier assertion, most role-players, male or female, stick to the game and the community through which they were introduced to the hobby in the first place. Simply based on the fact that due to the lack of mainstream industry marketing most people are exposed to the hobby through friend referrals, it's easy to draw the conclusion that communities who already have a lot of female members will tend to gain a larger proportion of female members than other communities, regardless of the products they're centred around.<br/><br/>Actually, at least on the surface, there are a<i>lot</i>more similarities between D&amp;D and Primetime Adventures than there is between D&amp;D and Vampire: the Requiem LARP, or even Amber DRPG. Watch an ongoing game of D&amp;D and PTA, and you will likely see people sit around a table, talk in character, talk out of character, pass little tokens around, draw cards / rolling dice and go Oooh! and Aaah! at the results, laugh, and eat Cheetoes. Watch a game of Amber DRPG and you will see people sit around a table, talk most always in character or in narrative language, maybe get up and act out a scene spontaneously, rarely if ever break character or munch on Cheetoes. To an outsider, a game of Amber or V:tR LARP might seem closer to improv acting, while a game of D&amp;D or PTA looks more like social night with a rousing game of Sorry.<br/><br/>The play procedures of Amber and LARPs might lend themselves better to attracting women than the play procedures of D&amp;D or PTA, but as role players aware of game design we know that, deeper down, the difference between most games of V:tR and D&amp;D is mostly that V:tR is acted out while standing up and wearing makeup. Questions of narrative authority, for example, might be important - feminists all agree that there is such a thing as a "female narrative", to my understanding, and thus games which leave the narrative up to a single individual who is with 95% certainty male might discourage women from such games. I'm quite interested in exploring these questions further, from a game mechanics perspective.<br/><br/>Yeah, let's merge a "System Does Matter" thread with a "Women and Gaming" thread. What could<i>possibly</i>go wrong?<br/>I'd agree there is some tendency to stick with the system you were introduced with, but I don't think it is strong among convention attendees.  Convention attendees are exposed to a lot of different systems, and are reasonably aware of the range of play.  For example, there are a visible minority of AmberCon NorthWest attendees who regularly run story games like Polaris, Best Friends, Primetime Adventures, and so forth - so attendees know reasonably well what those games are like.  At least within the U.S., nearly everyone is introduced to roleplaying via Dungeons &amp; Dragons - and this includes Amber DRPG and LARP players.  That said, the community is certainly hugely important for any game regarding who plays.  <br/><br/>As for <a href="http://www.amberconnw.org/" rel="nofollow"><b>AmberCon NorthWest</b></a>... The preregistration deadline is <i>this weekend</i>, and if you want to run Apocalypse World (which would be welcome) the deadline for game submissions is next weekend (August 28).  I usually run one Amber Diceless game and one non-Amber game (1001 Nights, Polaris, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288030/#Comment_288030" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T10:50:54+00:00" title="August 21, 2010 10:50AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arvid</cite>1) Have gender demographics (or other demographics for that matter) changed with the story games movement?

In Norway, I don't personally know any players who've started gaming through story games; the ones I know all started with traditional RPGs. The larp world, however, seems to be a whole different thing - I think there's a lot of recruitment of women there, who haven't necessarily played any form of tabletop RPG.<br/><br/>2.
