But I've always been vaguely dissatisfied by it. It does not, as a rule, produce satisfying stories. The accumulation of so many different story elements combined with the gravitational pull of the multiple endings tends to produce stories that are schizophrenic at best, and almost gibberish at worst. The rules are vague and hand-wavey enough that playing it competitively or tactically leads either to one or two players steamrolling the group or tedious rules-lawyer disputes and frustration.<br/><br/>That said, when approached by all with a light touch, it can be a genuinely enjoyable experience. With an experienced player to set the tone, or if it had better instruction in best practices and techniques, I think the game is quite playable and fun as is. But I'm not (especially) interested in that right now. I'm interested in hacking it.<br/><br/>I'm aware of a couple hacks already in existence. Once Upon a Time in an Archipelago combines the game with Archipelago to create a more familiar role-playing experience. And I think there are a number of out-of-genre hacks with different cards floating around out there. I haven't played any of those, but I'm eager to try, and if anyone wants to point me to interesting variations I'm not yet aware of, I'd be grateful.<br/><br/>I have tried a couple a drifts or informal hacks in play. When I played with my sister and our eight-year-old cousin, we just took turns making up a story that used all the cards in our hand. This is surprisingly not that easy, and the results are entertaining in a low-key, no stakes kind of way. My cousin wanted to keep playing long after me and my sister tired of the game.<br/><br/>In my most recent play-through with the group I play RPGs with (all new to the game), I suggested asking leading questions of the storyteller. "What happened to the old king?" "Was the child a boy or a girl?", etc. It is a technique that I noticed getting some laid-back use on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop play-through, but once I suggested it here, it quickly became the main mechanic of the game. It provides an amusingly tactical element, as the storyteller tries to guess what you want her to say and then say the opposite. Despite the increased competitive pressure, I found this produced more exciting, less-predictable stories with greater texture and detail than vanilla OuaT, and I found it to be my favorite experience to date with the game, and was really enjoyed by some of the other players. But it definitely didn't work for everyone. A couple players, who had difficulty getting a word in edgewise (a little bit of good-natured yelling and raucousness typified the game), or had difficulty grasping the finer points of when Interruptions were possible, found the experience frustrating. And of the six players, only four made significant contributions to the two or three stories we played. <br/><br/>I think using the third edition rules sheet (which is clearer than my first edition booklet) would help with the rules problems, and maybe taking turns getting to ask questions (something like one question per played card) would help with the pace and social frustration issues. With those changes, I'm eager to try this version out again.<br/><br/>I've also been pondering hacking the game to require more inherent story structure, rather than the traditional "and then this happened, and then this." One possibility that occurred to me was playing certain characters and places, etc. into traditional story slots, like playing this character into protagonist, that into mentor, that into villain, and so forth. There would have to be rules for changing the roles around in certain situations, attaching and removing aspects, etc. <br/><br/>Yet another possibility that occurred to me was stealing Dan Harmon's story circles. The top of your circle must include a character and either a place, an aspect or an event. Some slots could hold objects or other characters. Slots 3 and 5 (I think, I'm writing this from memory) require at least a place or an aspect, etc. When other players interrupt you, they spin off their own circle by attaching a character that is the protagonist of their story. When you are the storyteller you can play on other people's circle in order to empty your hand, but your circle must be complete in order to play your ending. Something along those lines.<br/><br/>Does anyone else have any other drifts or hacks of the game they've played or designed? Any half-baked ideas for hacks of your own? Brainstorms for nailing down or improving my proposed hacks? Or even thoughts on best practices for playing vanilla OuaT?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437545/#Comment_437545" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T09:48:48+00:00" title="August 20, 2014  9:48AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2014 5:36PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The rules are vague and hand-wavey enough that playing it competitively or tactically leads either to one or two players steamrolling the group or tedious rules-lawyer disputes and frustration.</blockquote>\nI believe you nailed it here. Whenever I and other people played the game tactically, it produced disappointed stories while when we ignored the competitive part, it became a lot better. I think that you need to remove any element that brings out any form of competition between the narrators, like the interruption rules. I feel as if the creators didn't believe that people could play a game just for the enjoyment of building a story together.<br/><br/>Instead of having people interrupting, have rules for helping each other. That will add to the group feeling of doing something <i>together</i>.\n<blockquote>Yet another possibility that occurred to me was stealing Dan Harmon's story circles.

What happens in (2) comes back in (6), and so it goes the whole circle around. He even got one more reincorporation, where the theme (good-evil, nature-technology) starts with one side of the theme, turns around to the other side, and then finally goes back to the first towards the end.<br/><br/>If you want reincorporation\u2014which is very important to stories; when you reincorporate, the audience knows the end is getting closer\u2014then turn up a couple of cards at the beginning of the session. The story doesn't have to evolve around those cards, but they should be sowed early in the story to be reaped later towards the end.\n<blockquote>Does anyone else have any other drifts or hacks of the game they've played or designed?

Each role will affect the story in some way.<br/>- Some cards can lay the theme for the story early in the game.<br/>- Having a pacing mechanism that can control how long the game takes, even have the possibility to end a game early if necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437602/#Comment_437602" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-21T11:50:00+00:00" title="August 21, 2014 11:50AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a thought about this on the way to work this morning: in order to make it more co-op and less competitive, why not port in some structure from <b>Apples to Apples</b>?<br/><br/>Deal 1 Ending at the start of the game, face up where everyone can see it, then deal Story cards as normal; the Storyteller draws a card at the start of their turn, then begins/continues the story by playing any card from their hand, but them everyone else chooses a card from their hand and plays it face down. The Storyteller chooses one of those to use and continues the current scene using that element, after which the player whose card was chosen becomes the next Storyteller: everyone else who played a card draws a replacement.<br/><br/>There's still the issue of Interrupt cards, but maybe you could play one to interrupt the 'play cards' phase and simply become the new Storyteller by force majeure, but you have  to draw a replacement card; perhaps even discard and replace the current Ending when this occurs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437664/#Comment_437664" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-23T15:12:17+00:00" title="August 23, 2014  3:12PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> <br/><br/>Rules for helping each other is very good. Will consider more.<br/><br/>Also, excellent point regarding reincorporation. Requiring that there be some sort of relationship between the matching sets on the story circle seems like it would be key for something like that working. And regarding the observation about the thematic concerns of the story circle: I wonder if there is any potential in using something like the Everway deck or the major arcana, which imply a concept and it's reverse as sort of a hinge or theme card for a given circle. Possibly starting to get too busy?<br/><br/>Your point also made me think about a Cloud Atlas structure (book, not movie), wherein each player tells the first half of their story, nesting one inside the other (your first move has to involve the last element of the previous player, that is). Then, starting from the last player and ending with the first, the players must draw elements from the other players' stories to form their conclusions. There is potential in varying this structure to create other sets of somehow linked stories and a shared world. Hmm.<br/><br/>These kinds of structures mean everyone gets to play the whole way through, and everyone gets to play their ending (which is often a very satisfying element of OuaT play, when you get to do it), but ensures that everyone engages with everyone else creatively, unlike the version of the game I played with my cousin.<br/><br/>The player roles idea is interesting. I wonder if there is a way to divide up the endings that match a certain mode. A set of Ironic endings, a set of Dark Endings, a set of Romantic Endings.<br/><br/>I need to pull out my deck and play around, I think, which is just what I was hoping this thread would inspire for me.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">@James_Mullen</a><br/><br/>Yes. I dig it. Definitely going to try playing this way. It also made me briefly consider trying a gonzo version of OuAT with selected Cards Against Humanity cards, but with the regular endings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444518/#Comment_444518" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-03T01:34:02+00:00" title="April  3, 2015  1:34AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2015 2:23AM by amphigorist.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've actually been cogitating on some of these ideas for a few months now. I've got a couple ideas that seem potentially kinda fun to me, and I'm gonna try to write them up here over the next few days. (I've also thought of an idea inspired by OuaT that might become it's own legit independent game, if I get off my ass and make it.) Hopefully I'll get to playtest them soon, as well. Here's the first one I've written up, inspired (sorta) by playing Antoine Bauza's Hanabi.<br/><br/><b>Once Upon a What?</b><br/><br/>Pick the first storyteller by whatever means you see fit.<br/><br/>Deal nine cards to the center of the table. The storyteller draws two ending cards, picks the one she likes best and makes a private note of it (or just remembers). Both ending cards are then placed beside the the stack of nine in the center.<br/><br/>The storyteller then draws the top card from the stack of nine and holds it so that she cannot see it, but that all the other players can. She then starts the story with a couple sentences that satisfy the following requirements:<br/><br/>-Start with the phrase "Once upon a time, there was..."<br/><br/>-Give us a main character.<br/><br/>-Tell us a little about where they live or what their life is like.<br/><br/>-Tell us what they want.<br/><br/>-Think about foreshadowing the ending you've picked.<br/><br/>Then, starting with the player to the left of the storyteller, the other players ask the storyteller questions, trying to help prompt the storyteller to introduce the element on  her card (interrupts function the same as every other card). The storyteller answers the questions in one to three sentences, developing the story as they go.<br/><br/>The questioners can introduce any elements they like into the story through their questions, or push for certain story twists or developments, though the storyteller has unlimited authority to answer the questions as she chooses. The questioners should also respect the story as it has been told so far, and not try to negate any established elements of the story.<br/><br/>The questions can hint and imply, but they cannot directly mention the element on the card, or introduce it "by another name" or by including its definition (e.g. if the "Prince" card is drawn, the players should not ask "Is that when they met the prince?" or "Does the king have a son?", etc.)<br/><br/>When the other players feel that the storyteller has successfully mentioned the unseen element from the card in an answer, the storyteller should reveal her card, and the player who asked the prompting question becomes the new storyteller and draws a card in turn.<br/><br/>If all the non-storytelling players ask two questions in a given teller's turn without the storyteller mentioning the element on the card, then the storyteller discards that card and the player to her left becomes the new storyteller.<br/><br/>When all nine cards have been revealed or discarded, the original storyteller(OS) for the round may say a couple sentences to try to wrap up the plotlines before revealing the two ending cards. All players except for the original storyteller then vote on the one that best suits the story. For every player who chooses the same ending as the OS did, the OS earns a point. Play until everyone has been the OS at least once. At the end of the game, the player(s) with the most points can make a wish. It probably won't come true, but it's worth a shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
