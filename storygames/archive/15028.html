First, I ran the adventure starter, Goblin Hole for a small group. And then, ran Purple Worm Graveyard for a larger group. Although both these games were run with different players, there was a common occurrence between the two: the paladin killed another player.<br/><br/>In the Goblin Hole adventure the paladin slew the thief. Granted this was an accident since he one shot her. And the decision was not made lightly as it was the result of a considerable amount of griefing (the thief did not like the precepts of the paladin's order). In the second adventure the effort was more intentional. As the paladin went charging into a room the ranger attempted to trip him. This lead to a rapid series of events that resulted in the paladin beating the ranger to death. The odd thing in the second game was that no one tried to stop the paladin. They either stood their in shock, or healed the ranger between blows. It was a very strange occurrence.<br/><br/>Aside from this oddity things seemed to run pretty well. Character creation was a breeze, and there were no problems with the "no duplicate classes" rule. We had a good round table Q&amp;A to establish bonds. <br/><br/>None of the players were familiar with either Apocalypse World, or Dungeon World, but this was not a limiting factor because of the focus on character activity rather than rules guiding activity. In fact the more rules the players learned the worse it got, because they stopped focusing as much on what their characters were doing, and starting reading moves as menus.<br/><br/>Really the only major issue I ran into was with the larger group. Players felt combats required "rounds" where everyone was afforded an opportunity for action. This felt most natural from them being primarily traditional gamers. The issue that I had with it was that it was forcing disengaged player to participate in scenes they had no interest in. To me, one of the benefits of conversation actions is that it allows players with investment in the current activity to fully engage the system, while allowing those who don't to get a breather. I would have much rather the group broken up by their focus so we could have flipped spotlights around, but the notion of "don't split the party" was too ingrained for the one shot.<br/><br/>Generally speaking I am pretty happy with the system, but I think I would like to run and play in some more games before making a final assessment of it.</blockquote>\nUpdate: Moved to correct category                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341524/#Comment_341524" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-03T17:54:57+00:00" title="September  3, 2011  5:54PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did the paladin get to mark XP?  <br/><br/>Also, I don't think DW has any kind of round system, you take turns out of courtesy but there aren't "turns" in the D&amp;D sense.  That's a hard concept to get across, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341529/#Comment_341529" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-03T18:17:54+00:00" title="September  3, 2011  6:17PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first time we let him mark XP for denying mercy to an unbeliever. The second, we didn't because we determined he was acting in a way in conflict with his alignment.<br/><br/>You're correct about the round. My understanding is that turns are supposed to occur as they would in a conversation, which shifting spotlight to prevent monologue. Players were acting in "rounds" because they thought that was the only fair way to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
