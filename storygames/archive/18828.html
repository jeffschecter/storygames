I got some great advice, but...<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Dungeon World, and it seems that the Apocalypse rule set is a great venue for super heroes. Thought I would take a stab at writing a superhero hack.<br/><br/>So far, I've got the stats sketched out. Any thoughts?<br/><br/>(Edit - revamped the rules - got them a bit more flavorful ... I hope). Here are the Stats. In the next post I'll put up the Basic Moves.<br/><br/>Stats<br/>Each hero has 6 Stats: <br/><br/>Power (POW)<br/>Your Power is what you use to inflict damage, to move, and to help \u2013 all physically.<br/>Strong human +0; Super human +1; Amazing +2; Unbelievable +3<br/><br/>Experience (EXP)<br/>A long life may be nearly devoid of experience, while a short one may be packed with it.<br/>Good life +0; Full life +1; Amazing life +2; Unbelievable life +3<br/><br/>Angst (ANG)<br/>How troubled are you? Your Angst is the burden you carry \u2013 those you couldn't help, things you should have done, and things you shouldn't have done.<br/>A few slip ups +0; Not your fault +1; Why weren't you there? +2; What have you done? +3<br/><br/>Hope (HOPE)<br/>How can you overcome your Angst? What can any of us do against the evil in the world? All we can do is Hope. <br/>Everything's fine +0; It's going to get better +1; We can fix this +2; I can fix this +3<br/><br/>Resources (RES)<br/>Resources are your financial and physical assets. What do you have at your disposal?<br/>Surviving +0; Well off +1; Wealthy +2; Blindingly Wealthy +3<br/><br/>Presence (PRE)<br/>The way you effect people. Your Presence is your ability to get what you want from others.<br/>You're OK +0; People like you +1; Whatever you need +2; Whatever you want! +3<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421763/#Comment_421763" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T12:00:01+00:00" title="September 22, 2013 12:00PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And the Basic Moves:<br/><br/>BASIC MOVES<br/>Resist<br/>When you are resisting damage or influence, roll+POW (damage) or roll+HOPE (influence). On a 10+, you shrug it off and are unaffected. On a 7-9, the GM chooses a condition. You suffer from that condition until you find a way to get rid of it. On a 6-, you take -1 ongoing and the GM chooses a condition. You suffer from both until you deal with the cause. <br/>Dazed (an inconvenience)<br/>Hurt (slowed down)<br/>Crippled (almost out of the action)<br/>Down (out of the fight)<br/>Flummoxed (ann inconvenience)<br/>Embarrassed (a set-back)<br/>Disgraced (a serious problem)<br/>Shunned (out of the fight)<br/>When you are Down or Shunned, you can Make a Sacrifice to get back in the game.<br/><br/>Smash<br/>When you hit someone (or something) with your fist or a melee weapon, roll+POW. On a 10+, you deal your damage AND have the option to Boost (see Special Move, Boost) or gain +2 forward against your target. On a 7-9, you deal your damage and your opponent gets to hit back.<br/><br/>Blast<br/>When you hit someone (or something) with a ranged attack, roll+POW. On a 10+, you deal your damage AND have the option to Boost (see Special Move, Boost) or gain +2 forward against your target. On a 7-9, you deal your damage and choose one option.<br/>The bad-guys call in a counterstrike. <br/>You have to move to get the shot, putting you in danger as described by the GM.<br/>You loose sight of the target.<br/><br/>Plead Your Case<br/>When you plead your case to authority, roll+PRE. On a 10+, choose two options. On a 7-9, choose one option.<br/>Good Graces. You are in the authority's good graces and get +1 forward with that Authority.<br/>The authority acts favorably on your words.<br/>No one argues against you.<br/><br/>Understand<br/>When you try to understand what is really happening, roll+EXP. On a 10+, ask the GM three questions, which she will answer honestly. On a 7-9, ask one question. You get +1 forward when acting on the answer.<br/>Is anyone lying?<br/>Is anything hidden?<br/>What's the real danger?<br/>Who will help me?<br/>What's a good escape route?<br/>What happened here recently?<br/>What is about to happen?<br/><br/>Athletics<br/>When you perform an impressive athletic feat, roll+POW. On a 10+, you perform the feat flawlessly and get +1 forward on your next physical feat (including Smash and Blast). On a 7-9, you perform the feat, but slip up a bit and get -1 forward on your next physical feat.<br/><br/>Persevere<br/>When you continue on in the face of danger, roll+HOPE. On a 10+, the danger doesn't happen and you succeed. On a 7-9, the GM will make you an offer that's just as bad if not worse than failure. Take it, and you succeed, don't and you fail.<br/>Use this move ONLY if no other moves apply.<br/><br/>Run a Search<br/>When you search the internet for information, roll+EXP. On a 10+, you succeed and choose three options. On a 7-9, you succeed and choose one option.<br/>Nothing can be traced back to you.<br/>You complete a simple transaction.<br/>You get to ask one question which the GM will answer honestly (you get +1 forward when acting on that answer):<br/>Who is responsible for this?<br/>Who knows about this?<br/>Who is trying to use this?<br/>What is the item's purpose?<br/><br/>Drive/Pilot<br/>When you drive or pilot a vehicle, roll+EXP. On a 10+, you drive/pilot flawlessly and gain +1 forward on Drive/Pilot. On a 7-9, you successfully drive/pilot the craft, but there is a complication, introduced by the GM.<br/><br/>Force of Personality<br/>When you use your personality to accomplish something, roll+PRE. On a 10+ your personality shines through and you accomplish your goal; gain +1 forward against your target. On a 7-9, your personality isn't as strong as it could be; you succeed, but there is a hint of weakness and you take -1 forward against your target.<br/><br/>Defend<br/>When you defend another person or specific location, roll+HOPE. On a 10+, choose three options. On a 7-9, choose one option.<br/>Give your ward +1 to Resist the attack.<br/>Redirect an attack against your ward to you.<br/>Deal your damage to the attacker.<br/>Boost.<br/><br/>Help or Hinder<br/>When you help or hinder someone, roll+Bond with them.

On a 7-9, they receive the bonus, but you put yourself at risk as described by the GM.<br/><br/>Trivia<br/>When you give the details you know on a subject, roll+EXP. On a 10+, the GM will tell you an interesting and useful fact on the topic. On a 7-9, the GM will give you an interesting fact on the topic. <br/> <br/><br/>SPECIAL MOVES<br/>Boost<br/>When you Boost, choose one option.<br/>Collateral Damage. Everything in the area that is unprotected gains the \u201cBusted\u201d tag.<br/>Focused Damage. You pump the power and deal damage again.<br/>Clear Sight.

You disarm your target.<br/>You can only use Boost if another move allows.<br/><br/>Make a Sacrifice?<br/>What are you willing to do to stay in the story? When \u2026 I mean, IF you die, roll (no bonus). On a 10+, you're back! It was just a flesh wound! On a 7-9, some agent from beyond the grave will make you a deal. Take the deal, and you're back in the fight. On a 6-, some agent from beyond the grave will offer you slavery. If you accept, you're back. The agent can end the slavery at any time, ending your life along with it.<br/><br/>Hiding Out<br/>When hiding out and avoiding danger, roll(+2 if in a safe, equipped space; +0 if in a safe OR equipped space; -1 if neither). On a 10+, you recover from one condition and reduce the any ongoing penalties against you by 1. You can also choose one or more Benefits. For every two Benefits you choose, the GM can impose a Drawback. On a 7-9, you can choose one or more Benefits. For each Benefit, the GM can impose a Drawback. On a 6-, you can choose up to two Benefits. For each Benefit, the GM can impose two Drawbacks.<br/>BENEFITS<br/>Recover from one condition.<br/>Reduce your ongoing penalty by 1.<br/>Repair gear.<br/>Make a plan, gain +1 forward when acting on that plan.<br/>DRAWBACKS<br/>An enemy finds out where you are.<br/>You get bad publicity.<br/>You lose an ally or an important piece of tech.<br/>An enemy captures someone important to you.<br/><br/>Public Relations<br/>When you try to influence the public's opinion of you, roll+PRE.

On a 7-9, you can't get what you want unless you choose three options.<br/>You pay a lot more than the item is worth; reduce your Wealth by one level.<br/>An enemy of the GM's choosing finds out about this purchase.<br/>The item is sub-par and is -1 to use.<br/>The item belonged to someone very powerful who lost it and is trying to get it back.<br/>The item constantly needs to be repaired. If used without being repaired between uses, it imposes -3.<br/>The item is being tracked by the government.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422467/#Comment_422467" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-05T16:44:20+00:00" title="October  5, 2013  4:44PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the above stuff has been adjusted - I'll see about editing those posts once I feel like things are getting more solid. <br/><br/>Here are my ideas for Origins:<br/><br/>Tech<br/>You\u2019ve got an answer to every problem. You take a look, see what\u2019s there, then dig around in your toolbox and if you don\u2019t already have just the right something, you build it. Your power comes from gadgets as small as a bug to the size of a starship. Play a Tech if you want to make your own super powers.<br/><br/>Elemental<br/>Your powers come from the earth. You are an incarnation of one of the four elements (water, earth, fire and air), or you follow a totem animal. Play an elemental if you want to wield the power of nature.<br/><br/><br/>Martial Artist<br/>You might not look like much, but you are very dangerous. Your control over your own body translates to a supreme confidence that can calm or terrify others. Maybe you can\u2019t fly, but get to the top of the building? Who needs an elevator when you can backflip up the window ledges in one tenth the time? Play a martial artist if you want to use cool moves and discipline.<br/><br/>Alien<br/>You\u2019re not from around here. It could be that you are an outcaste. Or you\u2019re on a mission. Whatever it is, your powers are normal to your people, but on Hero World, you\u2019re something special. Of course, you always knew that. Play an alien if you want to be able to call on powers from beyond the stars.<br/><br/>Mutant<br/>You\u2019re not human, you\u2019re something different. Maybe something better. You\u2019re powers come from genetic mutation, naturally occurring or \u2026 otherwise. Play a mutant if you want to play a wide variety of powers.<br/><br/>Magic<br/>Some would say that you\u2019re meddling with things not meant for humanity, something beyond our ken. You would say that you\u2019re commanding powers not meant for anyone else. You can handle it, of course you can. Play a Mage if you want to cast spells and summon otherworldly beings.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422468/#Comment_422468" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-05T16:46:40+00:00" title="October  5, 2013  4:46PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here are a few of the Styles. The difference between Origins and Styles: Origins are where your powers come from. Styles are how you use them.<br/><br/>Lurker<br/>You stay in the shadows and use them and their fear as a weapon. Play a Lurker if you want to walk unseen and strike from the darkness.<br/><br/>Slugger<br/>Who needs subtlety? Not you. You hit stuff. Play a Slugger if you want to hit stuff. Sound boring? Oh, no. Just go try it and find out.<br/><br/>Smart Ass<br/>You bring the fun to the party. You dance along the edge of the maelstrom that is a hero\u2019s life right along side everyone else, the difference: you\u2019re having a bit of fun doing it. OK, sometimes at other peoples\u2019 expense, but c\u2019est la vie! Play a Smart Ass if you want to make witty comments while bringing down the bad guys.<br/><br/>Tried and True<br/>You\u2019re the one everyone loves. You\u2019re the best hope, leading the charge against for evil. When someone says \u201cHero,\u201d you\u2019re who comes to mind. So it stands to reason that whenever anyone says \u201cSave us!\u201d you are, once again, who comes to mind. Play Tried and True if you want to be the hero on which everyone knows they can depend.<br/><br/>Legend<br/>The stories were true! Well, one of them, anyway, because here you are! Risen from legends, a figure of renown and glory, so many people know of you. How will they feel when they actually meet you? Play a Legend if you want to be a hero of literature and ancient sagas.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422775/#Comment_422775" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T11:41:25+00:00" title="October 12, 2013 11:41AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been giving a lot of thought - I've been feeling kind of ... off about the basic moves. Feels like I'm missing an opportunity. Here are some basic moves that better represent where I feel the game should be going.<br/><br/><i>One on One</i><br/>When you go One on One with a villain, roll+POW. On a 10+, you give the villain consequence and no one can interrupt the fight. On a 7-9, you give the villain a consequence and they give you one and no one can interrupt the fight.<br/><br/>What\u2019s important is \u201cHow?\u201d If you give a \u201cStunned\u201d consequence, how? Do you slam them up against a wall? Do you punch them in the nose? Do you blast them in the chest? If you get a \u201cStunned\u201d consequence, the GM can describe it or leave it up to you. And the same is true for each consequence given. Always go back to the story.<br/><br/><i>Bring the Pain</i><br/>When you take on a group of thugs, roll+POW. On a 10+, choose three options. On a 7-9, they give you a consequence and you choose one option.<br/>Take down half the original group<br/>Take down the other half of the original group<br/>No one else gets put in danger<br/>The thugs offer up information in exchange for you letting them get away<br/>The thugs still standing at the end of your action are terrified of you and run away<br/><br/><i>Call for Backup</i><br/>When you call on another hero to help you against a villain, roll+HOPE. On a 10+, you each get +1 forward against the villain. On a 7-9, the helping hero gets +1 forward against the villain and the villain gives you a consequence.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424028/#Comment_424028" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T13:36:36+00:00" title="November 10, 2013  1:36PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to figure out how I want my primary combat move to go for Hero World. I want it to provide flexibility to the characters, but I want to avoid the Dungeon World "Hack and Slash" and "Volley." I think those are both great moves, but I want something different for superheroes. Here's what I've got, but I am far from satisfied with it. <br/><br/>Toe to Toe<br/>When you go Toe to Toe with the bad guys, roll+POW. On a 10+, you give the bad guys a Consequence and choose three options. On a 7-9, you give the bad guys a Consequence and choose one option, and they give you a Consequence. <br/>No one else joins the bad guys in the fight<br/>No one else gets put in danger<br/>They offer a deal (the GM will tell you the deal)<br/>You impress someone important to you<br/>You learn something important (the GM will tell you what)<br/><br/>I want something that applies to fighting badass villains one-on-one as well as to groups of mooks.
