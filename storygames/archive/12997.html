Of course, I hadn't thought about it properly. On reflection, I'm guessing that a collaborative storytelling group will try (assuming they haven't got serious social issues) to make sure that their contributions are both acceptable and awesome. For a group of gamers used to inhabiting the fiction of a long term campaign, all the players should be fairly aware of the constraints and opportunities of acceptability. This fluency of the game world, coupled with collaboration, will probably tend players to create kosher stories. Dodgy narratives are more likely to be frowned upon and tossed aside, while acceptable narratives are more likely to excite the players and be developed during play.</blockquote>\nWhich got me thinking about the idea of genre fluency at the tabletop. That's what I'm tentatively labelling the collective understanding of a trope\u2014the language of expression between a group that tends to shape the collaborative fiction. If you know the proper name for it, tell me.<br/><br/>I'm interested in the idea that long term play ("campaign play") generates a specific genre for the collaborators and that it teaches it with repetition. So, the creative endeavours of a GM and his gamers, over months, teaches all participants the technique, form and content of their fiction, thereby creating a kind of micro genre. It's the collective awareness that the Baron of the Elves wouldn't get a tattoo of "I love mum" on his chest. It's also the collective awareness that when he does, there's a bloody good reason.<br/><br/>So, if we become fluent in this micro genre, isn't it interesting to see how that is nudged and used when plugged into another gaming engine? One of the things that upsets me is when a group of players experience genre confusion\u2014when one guy unknowingly disagrees about what should happen in "this kind of story." If a gaming group shifts temporarily into another system to explore a different facet of the fiction, would the genre they've been building over months and years still stand? Is there an advantage in gaming in your own game world over and over using different systems?<br/><br/>Specifically, if you've tried using two different systems (one story game and one non-story game) to tell stories about the same generated micro genre (campaign), what were the two systems, how long had you been playing the campaign, and did you find that there was loyalty to the genre? Do you remember if any part of the fiction was curbed by your awareness of the genre? Did you feel that your micro genre was violated by the mechanisms of a new game system (implying that your genre had been associated in some fashion with the mechanics of its parent system)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292982/#Comment_292982" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-11T05:30:21+00:00" title="September 11, 2010  5:30AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Close, but not quite. I ran a short Earthdawn game using Heroquest to players who had previously played ED with me for 2-3 years. Different campaign, different takes on some things, but a lot of the same aesthetic.<br/><br/>A lot of things worked as they are supposed, but don't really work in Earthdawn RAW -- half-magic, doing random cool shit, etc.<br/><br/>Some things were more problematic. Earthdawn has a strong "beating crap out of things" component, and a moderate "specific powers do specific things" component, both of which HQ by default washes down somewhat. ...but it was also the first HQ game I ran -- so things might turn out different now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
