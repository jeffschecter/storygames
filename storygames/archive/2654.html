We've played Dogs in the Vineyard (both straight and as Jedi), Primetime Adventures, and Kill Puppies for Satan.  Once we played "Apples to Apples" and had an absolute blast.<br/><br/>We lost a couple people and we'd like to recruit one or two to round out the group.  We are planning on meeting somewhere in the Herndon/Reston/Centerville area but we also have some flexibility there.<br/><br/>I've still got my kooky Amber rules to playtest, and we've got a long list of games we'd like to try.  Chances are good that if there's something you're hot to try, we are too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dunlaing" title="dunlaing"><img alt="dunlaing" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/5251/myavataryn1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dunlaing">dunlaing</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61430/#Comment_61430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T11:17:17+00:00" title="March 18, 2007 11:17AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I live in DC and would be interested in playing on Sunday afternoons (although not today).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played Dogs in the Vineyard (and loved it) and Primetime Adventures (didn't really click for me, but I'd be up for trying again) and have played Amber before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can be reached at my user name at gmail dot com.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lor%20the%20Swede" title="Lor the Swede"><img alt="Lor the Swede" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lor%20the%20Swede">Lor the Swede</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81551/#Comment_81551" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T18:42:27+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  6:42PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I live in Morgantown, WV but make trips back to the greater DC area about once every six weeks.
