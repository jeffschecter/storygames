                    So, I'm of the opinion that good streamlined (indie?) gaming makes games where, when a character sheet is involved, there is nothing but useful flags and/or player chosen expressions of not only their character but what they want to get involved in game-wise.<br/><br/>However, a lot of D&amp;D style gaming includes things in character creation (or later, during 'leveling') that aren't explicitly part of the player's choices. For instance, you may have chosen to be a Druid, but you didn't ask for an Animal Companion. You may have chosen Ventrue, but part and parcel of that comes certain 'abilities'. Heck, even in the Shadow of Yesterday or FATE, I may have chosen early on to get a particular ability but now I don't want it or never use it.<br/><br/>These situations are usually remedied by giving options for customizing classes or getting paid back for getting rid of these parts of your character. There are nearly endless forum posts and books filled with these options explored and permuted. I'm not worried about this because I don't consider it a problem.<br/><br/>However, I still remember at some point facing a challenge in a D&amp;D game when I realized that something I'd added way back when for some flavor or class ability also granted me some small thing that helped solve a problem and made a cool scene. That is, it's something on the sheet that leads to a cool scene that the player enjoyed (in my mind, a flag) but that no one knew about (making it invisible).<br/><br/>So, how can my favorite games get me this thrill again? How can I be surprised about my character all over again?<br/><br/>My first thought is to have other players give you abilities mid-game, on the spot. But, what if Andy thinks it would be totally awesome for me to have frog-like leaping and I don't? That creative energy will be wasted, and we'll have started a tangent that didn't lead toward awesome gaming (either because Andy's idea sucked or I'm a complete moron for not wanting frog-like leaping). This could even lead to worse situations: "Wait, I thought you had frog-like leaping! That's the entire point of this scene! Man, this sucks."<br/><br/>Any ideas?                </div>

<p>There's an answer to 'what if Andy has a terrible idea about your character'... insulate it from the flagging system until it has had time to assimilate or has been removed. I don't know if it's a <em>good</em> answer - it's too visible - but it's possible.</p>

                            Mark, are you talking about unforeseen combinations or repercussions of stats?  Cause I've seen that in <em>Dogs</em> and even <em>PTA</em>.  My ne'er-do-well young gentleman had Constable Edwards on his sheet for the longest time since the Constable would get him out of trouble -- but when it came time to have his father arrested, my character was able to use that connection in a heretofore unforeseen way.                        </div>

                            So, when it came time to have  your father arrested, you looked down at your sheet, saw Constable Edwards, and unexpectedly discovered another aspect that you hadn't imagined but could now use and use again in the future?<br/><br/>Then yeah, that'd be the sort of the same experience. It's hard for me to pick out what I mean, because it usually comes (for me) from realizing/remembering the baggage in traditional games.

                            Just last night Remi was talking about this, sort of, in reference to a Gen Con Heroquest session.  He played a slave who had a zillion slave skills and was an awesome slave.  Then he was freed and all of a sudden those slave skills took on an entirely different tenor.  He'd forgotten that his character was utterly useless out of original context; it came as a delightful surprise as I recall.                        </div>

                            Heh, I recall that character well.<br/>
<br/>
Heroquest tends to actually be relatively expansive like D&amp;D. But in the case in question we were playing "OtherWorld" meaning that Jason and Remi and everyone were making up the elements of their keywords as they went along. At first this seems to match Mark's notion that it's being able to give abilities in the middle of the game. And it's true that this works to create those moments in a way.<br/>
<br/>
But, they're not "discoveries" then. They're surprises in that you're creating facts nobody knew about on the spot. But Mark's thing seems to be discovering a use for a previously enumerated dimension that you hadn't noticed before. So it wasn't in this particular case that Remi was making up new stuff. In fact, at the time in question I can't say that he did at all.<br/>
<br/>
In Remi's case (and the case JBR is talking about) it was a question of changing situation. That is, the character remained the same, but as the situation changed, some already extant ability gets a new take on it because it's considered from a new perspective.<br/>
<br/>
There's an implicit dilemma: Do I focus on just having few notes about the character to make sure the game sticks to what it's good at? Or do I allow the game to enumerate the character expansively, so that these moments of serendipity can occur?<br/>
<br/>
I tend to lean to the latter, actually. Rather what HQ does well is to give mass level focus in the keywords for the character, but then to create micro-level breadth on the ability level. Is "Swordsman" an ability that leads to thematic play? As opposed to the Warrior keyword? Well, it can be if the situation is such that the character's ability with the sword is challenged somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Call these things not "invisible flags" but "potential flags" or "waiting flags." They're just waiting for the situation to morph somehow into something where they will, in fact, be interesting to play around. The GM can hammer on the more obvious personality traits, relationships and keywords, etc. So he can maintain focus that way. But the individual situations can still be surprising, when the player discovers that some as yet uninteresting listing on the sheet suddenly stands out in a given situation.<br/>
<br/>
A fully fleshed out HQ character can have more than 60 abilities on the sheet. Yet somehow the forest essence of the character is not lost for all the detail trees.<br/>
<br/>
Now, again, that indicates my bias somewhat. I play a lot more "meandering" than many focused story people do. But I think that it's good to try to have both focus, and extra danglies on the character that can become important spontaneously.<br/>

                            I think this come from two places, Mark:<br><br>1) multiplicity of interpretation - Very, very often, putting one thing down on the character sheet has multiple repercussions in the fiction.  The character sheet is just a labor-saving device to help our feeble human memories, after all, and it uses a <em>lot</em> of shorthard.  So we put down "+5 Hide" and it means that you can hide in a number of different places, and maybe that you're good at finding other people hiding, and your hiding has effects on other characters, and so on.  In crunchy traditional games, many powers (feat, skill, advantage, whatever) has multiple discrete effects; in looser more indie-flavored games, many stats are loosely-defined relationships or concepts that can be interpreted many ways.  Increasing the individual effects of a power or opening up interpretation of a stat will increase the frequency that this happens.<br><br>2) combinations and permutations - The more stuff you have on the character sheets, the more likely it becomes that two or more of them will interact in interesting ways.  Burning Wheel and FORKing, Exalted and Comboing, and World of Warcraft tactics are all examples of this, and a large part of the tactical element of these games is in finding useful and exploitable combinations.  (Note that some of these combinations involve taking one thing off of your sheet and combining it with one thing off of my sheet, and producing a teamwork-based combination.)  Now, this happens more often the crunchier the game is and the more individual items go onto individual character sheets.  The number of potential permutations goes through the roof (and it's quite possible to exceed the players' ability to keep track of them).<br><br>Does all that sound accurate to what you're talking about, Mark?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Heya Mark, you said: 
<blockquote>However, I still remember at some point facing a challenge in a D&amp;D game when I realized that something I'd added way back when for some flavor or class ability also granted me some small thing that helped solve a problem and made a cool scene. That is, it's something on the sheet that leads to a cool scene that the player enjoyed (in my mind, a flag) but that no one knew about (making it invisible).</blockquote>
Can you give us a little more detail here? Because I don't particularly see this as being a flag as you described it. It seems more like a resource, and a forgotten resource at that. Was the scene cool because this ability was something the GM saw on your sheet and moved the scene towards? Or that you do? Or was it something that you had on your sheet, got into a scene, and suddenly realized would help you do something cool and/or overcome a challenge? <br><br>Because the latter is cool, but it doesn't really seem like a flag.<br><br>Now, on to the actual question at hand: 
<blockquote>My first thought is to have other players give you abilities mid-game, on the spot. But, what if Andy thinks it would be totally awesome for me to have frog-like leaping and I don't?</blockquote>
There are several answers that come to mind on this one, all in random order: <br><br>1) Make a game where it doesn't matter. If Andy wants you to have it, you get it. In this kind of game you don't have total character ownership, and so you have to trust the other players to be down together. Now, you may still have the ability to spin the ability (i.e. "I never use it because my father made me promise I would not become Frog Man"), but if they grant it, it is there. <br><br>2) As above, but if they force an ability you don't want onto you, you get a bonus token or something that you can call in later. Like, if you have two of them you can block the new suggestions, because you've gone with two things you didn't like already, or if you spend three you can remove an ability you don't like, or whatever. <br><br>3) Use a currency system like Universalis, where you can express you interest, disinterest, or blocking by spending tokens to keep the character in bounds in as much as you're willing to spend for it. In this situation other players may still be able to overcome you and give something to your character, but only if they want it enough to a) spend and b) know that they're putting something on the character you don't want. <br><br>4) Do a round-the-table where you call out for a cool new ability and each player at the table (GM included) comes up with one. You choose the one you like most. Maybe you have to then give the player who came up with the cool thing some reward or bonus. <br/><br/>5) Do up a story-chain style list where you put your character on a branching power path (like a stunt tree in Exalted), but then don't get to chose your powers yourself. The other players chose from the list, and get to send you down one path or another based on their choices. <br/><br/>6) Roll dice on a random table. Okay, that's getting away from the other players choosing though, so....<br/><br/>Josh's stacked abilities issue is another way to go without having to have the other players able to manipulate your character at all, but might be able to propose different combinations. In games like HeroQuest and Burning Wheel I've often seen one player suggest FORKs or augments to another player for their character. (i.e. "Hey, based on that pose you could totally FORK your Dance into your Sword roll!" or "Wait, don't you have basket weaving as one of your abilities? You could totally add that to your courtship because you just brought her a basket full of flowers!")                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I think you mean "furled" rather than "unfurled". Furled is when they're wrapped up and aren't flying.                        </div>

                            I think I know the effect you're talking about, and if I had to name one game where it happened the most to me, it was WFRP. The random skills made it possible to have most of what you need for a very basic character concept (I'm a Warrior!) and yet still have other things lurking around (Why can I dance though? And, by the way, <i>damn</i> I'm pretty!). Most of the stuff that doesn't immediately fit with ypur idea of your character gets forgotten about, but things can change, especially over a medium to long campaign. The warrior in question eventually found herself dancing on tables in a bar when her party totally ran out of money. It had a massive effect on her too - she learned that there was a whole extra weapon in her arsenal, for a start, and eventually retired to run a whorehouse she inherited from a halfling.<br/><br/>So, yes, invisible isn't the thing we're looking at, but rather forgotten or hidden away. These things are usually triggered (unfurled) when either the situation is dire and the player is rooting around for any last trump they can play, or when something particularly evocative happens, like being stranded at the base of a cliff in shark-filled waters, only to remember you have Scale Sheer Surface. In one situation, the thing, the Flag, is a complete surprise to everyone almost guaranteed, whereas in the second there's a chance that the GM remembered something about that and stuck in a situation to prompt the player to let their character do something interesting and different.<br/><br/>Now, how to engineer this situation? The obvious answer would be to load the characters down with dozens of skills and abilities, so that there's no way a player could ever remember it all. That or make there be a multitude of special rules which trigger in obscure but spectacular ways, but which are too complex to remember without trying them out once or twice. This is not ideal, I'd say. These are not mechanics, they're tricks to play on the players. <br/><br/>Perhaps give the players a chance to write down some particularly esoteric skills of their choice before they walk into character gen, with the option of a draw whenever they run into a dead end. Too simple? Probably. How about a chance for the players to work out what would be a wierd and cool way to resolve their problem, and give the key character(s) the necessary abilities permanently? Better, better. I see the group of hardened plate-mail wearing soldiers needing to creep into a camp, only to discover one of them has a dwarven mother and a knack for digging, or that another one is in fact a mathematical genius who can cause maximum chaos by cutting just one rope... or cooler things, I dunno. Horsewhisperer or something. Works well for GMless games or with GMs who prefer a looser, narrative style.                        </div>

I have to say, I like the idea of being able to "furl" and "unfurl" a flag in a game. Like, "Yea, I'm not resolving this Muse this game, but I am going to furl it so the GM knows I want to let it simmer and not be an active issue for now" and then later "Okay, time to unfurl the "King of the West" flag and let the GM know its time to give me some leadership bang action."                        </div>

                            Yeah, I gotta take a moment here and stomp on linguistic drift.  What we're talking about here isn't flags, which are indicators of player interest; we're talking about player resources.  Now, some resources (skills/traits/advantages/etc) can also function as flags, indicating an interest in content that highlights that aspect of the character.  However, by definition, if a player isn't aware of something, like a hidden resource, then it really can't be a flag (unless we're assuming a lot of unconscious choices in character generation).<br/><br/>This thread is about Invisible Resources, not Flags.  I propose a separate thread for Furled and Unfurled Flags, though, because that's got legs, too.                        </div>

I was playing a Bard in D&amp;D3.5. We were trying to figure out how to get an item we needed. It was in one of three houses and didn't have any way of knowing which it was in without looking through all of them. I'd completely forgotten a non-combat ability called Fascinate. With it, I was able to get the homeowners to listen to me at the tavern while others snuck around in their houses, guaranteeing that no one would come back early. We'd all forgotten about it and were searching through spells and skills trying to think of a solution.

1) I like this in that it doesn't have the imagined guilt I'd written about.

Those are consistent with what I'm talking about. Just how to engineer without the actual forgetfulness?<br/><br/>I too like the furling and unfurling, but Joshua is right in my opinion about moving that elsewhere.                        </div>

Sort of. What I'm trying to engender is a technique wherein a player is given an option to do something they'd never imagined their character doing. This requires, in my mind, both the newness of the option and the reinforcement that not only is this option a part of the character but has always been there.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            How about the character "sheet" as a diary? Diaries, journals, logbooks, scrapbooks, and the like have a lot of seemingly useless information in them as well as the meaty material -- at least mine do. I hope that this stands true for enough people to make the comparison useful.<br/><br/>Maybe the character has to record his perception of an event, and that can later influence the game? When I'm writing quickly (as I would be during an in-game journaling), I tend to make up short-hand as I go along. That could lead to interesting note interpretations later on (i.e. "Boss, we recieved your report that 'three spies tread water.' Did you need a wetsuit?" While the original intent of the note was something completely different, a wet suit would be awfully handy, now that it's mentioned.) <br/><br/>Alternately, you could have each player design a highly detailed portion of another player's character, let the player read it, and then seal it away in an envelope. While both players should remember the gist of what was just decided and then sealed away, little bits like specific names (connections) or underused skills ("He did take a few weeks of auto repair while in college-- but we're on the moon!") wouldn't necessarily stay fresh-- especially with the real life factors that often split games into overly tiny chunks. The first problem that I see with this method is that there's no way for a player to suddenly rediscover the forgotten information... Oh, how about paying resources of some sort so that the GM "declassifies" a line or two of text from the sheet? It could be boring fluff, something that the player already knows, or revelation of a forgotten skill that manages to save the day.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>I was playing a Bard in D&amp;D3.5. We were trying to figure out how to get an item we needed. It was in one of three houses and didn't have any way of knowing which it was in without looking through all of them. I'd completely forgotten a non-combat ability called Fascinate. With it, I was able to get the homeowners to listen to me at the tavern while others snuck around in their houses, guaranteeing that no one would come back early. We'd all forgotten about it and were searching through spells and skills trying to think of a solution.</blockquote>
As you say, this is just a note on the sheet that got forgotten. Giving a Fascinating performance at a tavern isn't even a radically new or inspired use for <i>this</i> ability, especially for a Bard character.<br/><br/>But I can relate to how this situation must have felt to you, at that gaming table, so I can see your drive to "hard-code" into a game possibilities for that to happen regularly.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I think this come from two places, Mark:<br/><br/>1) multiplicity of interpretation - (...) In crunchy traditional games, many powers (feat, skill, advantage, whatever) has multiple discrete effects; in looser more indie-flavored games, many stats are loosely-defined relationships or concepts that can be interpreted many ways. (...)<br/><br/>2) combinations and permutations - The more stuff you have on the character sheets, the more likely it becomes that two or more of them will interact in interesting ways. (...)</blockquote>
I like both approaches.<br/>There seems to be a middle ground between option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, games like <i>BESM</i> or <i>Savage Worlds</i> where "skills" are just rules effects for the player to color. But that coloring usually happens at character creation, so from then on they are fixed skills.<br/>If you find a way to leave that coloring process open (say, like the magic system of <i>Talislanta Fourth Edition</i>) you can have new uses for old skills quite regularly.<br/><br/>I still have to experiment with the <i>Over the Edge</i>-like option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, as I have played (GMed mostly) games that either leave everything to attribute checks and some set combat abilities (like <i>Basic D&amp;D</i> or <i>AD&amp;D 1</i>) or have extensive skill lists (like <i>Midgard</i> or <i>RuneQuest</i>).<br/><br/>The game I am working on (that I mentioned in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2021&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">library thread</a>) is taking approach #2:<br/><br/>Characters have skills that give bonuses to die rolls. Characters also have levels. The level tells you how many of your skills you can bring to working together, thus adding the bonuses for an action (provided that the player can give a plausible explanation of what that means in the "SIS").<br/><br/>Almost like that:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>(i.e. "Hey, based on that pose you could totally FORK your Dance into your Sword roll!" or "Wait, don't you have basket weaving as one of your abilities? You could totally add that to your courtship because you just brought her a basket full of flowers!")</blockquote>
I don't want to hassle with abstract hit points, and also a wound track that leaves characters with "-1, -2, ... -5 to all rolls" is not what I want, so I made wounds directly influence skills. A wound (from any source, be it a successful hit from a sword, a natural hazard, or an excerting action) "crosses off" a skill - for a given time, depending on the kind of wound.<br/>So without having a separate stat the skills themselves are the "hit points", and the character is effectively "minus something" but not "to all rolls".<br/><br/>I can envision that this temporal loss of valuable skills could make players think on their feet to come up with uses for other skills, or new combinations of the remaining skills.<br/>(Which I could now say was all I aimed for, but to be honest, before reading your post I wasn't aware that this could be a fun-provoking side effect.)<br/><br/>Is that helping you getting there:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>What I'm trying to engender is a technique wherein a player is given an option to do something they'd never imagined their character doing. This requires, in my mind, both the newness of the option and the reinforcement that not only is this option a part of the character but has always been there.</blockquote>

                            Complicated. Chris Chinn, in identifying the idea of flags, was talking about things where the player is saying, "Here, over here! Let's play around this!" Using mechanical choices to do so.<br/>
<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18072.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18072.0</a><br/>
<a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/02/flag-framing_03.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/02/flag-framing_03.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Now, the thing is that this is sometimes quite subtle. Some systems don't put any one flag all that particularly in the foreground in any way, and you have to discern what is a flag and what is not from some background noise of other abilities.<br/>
<br/>
But that's the point. If I see a relationship like "Hates Brother" that's likely a flag. But not 100% sure. Rather, it's a flag, but is it the one the player wanted to draw attention to. Perhaps it's his "Feels Odd Around Father" that's the real flag, and the brother ability was just tossed in as an afterthought to make the father ability have more meaning.<br/>
<br/>
You can't really know for sure before play in a system like HQ. Oh, in Sorcerer you have a kicker that stands out like a huge flag, and stuff like the reason the character became a sorcerer. But, barring that sort of systemic information on what's a flag, it's guesswork to some extent.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sure, you can ask the player. But interestingly, I'm not always sure that with such a system as HQ that the player really knows at start what it is particularly about the character that they'd most like to play around. I often get non-committal answers. Meaning that there are no really prominent flags.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, presumably the player chose the abilities in question because they interest him to play them in some way. That is, to some extent, every single ability is a tiny flag.<br/>
<br/>
So what I think were' talking about here, Mark and I, are flags that have been identified as interesting, and character resources (or other facets) that have the potential to be flags at some point in the future. If, in fact, a character's Swordsmanship ability becomes centrally important at some point, isn't it now a flag? Even if you stumble across it, once you can see that issues that pertain to X ability are things that the player is looking to play around with, doesn't that ability constitute a flag going forward?<br/>
<br/>
As for "furling" flags, that seems to match Fred Volkes idea of indicating areas about a character which you're specifically not interested in investigating.<br/>
<br/>
So the way I'm seeing it, and with the danger of extending the analogy taken into consideration, I'm thinking that most or maybe all abilities are "furled flags" that can become unfurled at any time. Heck a player can look at his sheet and say, "Man, that Eat's Well ability sounds like fun. Can we do something around that?" That's unfurling that flag. Or it can become unfurled in play due to situation.<br/>
<br/>
And then once unfurled, they can become furled again, when, say, a player has resolved the issues important to him surrounding that flag.<br/>
<br/>
I think the terminology works well. I'd be interested to hear what Chris thinks about it.<br/>

                            I'm not sure I buy the "all player resources are also flags, furled or unfurled."  In a game with prerequisites, for instance, I may buy Stat A so I can get Stat B.  I am in no way interested in Stat A and don't expect to be; it's not a flag.  Alternately, in a game that gives you sets of abilities (I'm thinking 7th Sea, where you buy a skill and you get three knacks within the skill) you may end up taking Stat A that you aren't interested in but you get it free with Stat B you are interested in.<br><br>Certainly many player resources can also point towards player flags, but I really believe this is an artifact of design rather than a fundamental element of how player resources function.                        </br></br></div>

                            Right, Mark.  And while it may become something I am interested, the thing on my character sheet is not put there to signify my interest.  So it's not a flag.  That it might come to be associated with something that I find interest in is simple serendipity.  Otherwise we could just put random words on our character sheets and call them "flags" with the assumption that eventually, maybe they'll correspond to something we're interested in.<br><br>See what I'm saying?  It's totally awesome that something may jump out at you later and you find that there's unknown gold under that little stat name.  That doesn't mean the stat was a flag this whole time and you didn't know it.  It's a different thing -- a very cool thing, but a different thing.                        </br></br></div>

                            The, "Oh man, I didn't realize I could go to such depths!" realization? I'm not sure.

It is an almost inverse example:<br><br>I play quite a bit of fun TSOY with Eric and Lisa Provost (et al.). Lisa and Mr. Et Al both have lying manipulative characters and I started out consciously as a foil to that, being shy and straightforward. However, my only Key that kept me that way was of Modesty. I simply didn't take subterfuge Abilities. Later on, we began a new chapter and I no longer had any Keys telling me to be shy. I found myself in a situation where lying would be the coolest dramatic thing to do. So, I took the Key of the Impostor and bemoaned my lack of Abilities to back it up (although I had a sorta Secret sorta Ability that got me through the situation). As I started racking up XP and purchasing Abilities I <i>never</i> bought anything regarding Subterfuge. Now, in this downtime, I realize a new aspect to my character by looking at the sheet: She's a horrible liar, but now a liar nonetheless.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I aim for this in thematic character driven play, and have hit it with reasonable success in the past, so here's some AP.  I find that the key is to imbue the character with lots of potential meaning, so I can use it later on as needed, and even rediscover it.  In practice, I did this in a play by email game that was largely freeform, very mythic in tone, and had lots of player power.  Itâ€™s over now, but while it played, it was a slow game, with posting maybe once a fortnight, or once a month.  During character creation, I did heaps of research into stuff that could relate to the character.  I sat with my book of symbolism and started with an entry tied to the base idea of the character, and then just started reading, jumping from entry to entry as one was referenced by another, and jotting down notes as I went on things that captured my interest.  I did the same with names, word origins; I got into the history of nursery rhymes for further inspiration, and war songs (the character was kind of a personification of war crossed with a Valkyrie, only with extra stuff as well).  I used this to build the character, with bits and pieces taken from all over the place.<br><br>Later on, when the game was playing, posts would come from the GM that would make my brain hurt with their goodness, and Iâ€™d sit and wonder how on earth I was going to respond.  At those times, I could drag out a reference book and look up a concept that was important in the game at the time.  Often Iâ€™d get that â€˜Oh, that makes so much sense, the symbolism of red roses simply has to change in her magic as she steps closer to facing her own guilt and towards redemption/destruction*â€™ discovery of something new in what had been there before.<br><br>Partly it was a process that helped me forget details that I could rediscover, but more importantly, it was a process that helped me build a strong framework of potential meanings that, in collaboration with a GM who really got what I was doing with the character, I could draw on to twist new meanings.  And these potential meanings were drawn from broader symbolism in the types of stories the game involved so that the other players could send them back to me with spin, and I could build on them myself because they didnâ€™t just rely on the setting of the game.<br><br>I think a key element was that I didnâ€™t try to create meanings for symbols from whole cloth.  If I had, and Iâ€™d forgotten what stuff meant, as was inevitable, that meaning would have been lost.  But if I say my character has an ambiguous relationship with red roses after betraying the race of unicorns who live in the Land of Red Roses and who she was sworn to protect, and tie that in to the symbolism of red roses in real world cultures, that meaning still exists even if I forget, and it can be communicated to other people without the boring info dump, while at the same time it tinges the concepts of betrayal and protection with things related to red roses.  And if I say sheâ€™s kind of like a Valkyrie, it makes sense to say that one of her powers is the ability to dance on sword tips through the middle of battle, then I get some damn cool visuals and a neat power.  And later on, I get to discover that if she can do this, sheâ€™s pretty unkillable by conventional means, which can give her a complex if sheâ€™s got a death wish following the aforementioned betrayal of a sacred trust.  If youâ€™re going to play a game of theme and meaning, I think itâ€™s easier to use the language that already exists where possible, rather than create a new one.  Otherwise, you end up failing to communicate, even with yourself.<br><br>In this game, the GM could make me clap with joy with an oblique reference to something that was relevant to my character in a thread relating entirely to another character, because it indicated to me that there was a commonality of issues between my character and the situation the other character was in.<br><br>Claire                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Joshua, what if we said "anything the player chooses to put on the character sheet, but is not required to put on." So the pre-reqs, no, but the selected item that needed the pre-req yes?<br/>
<br/>
Still, interestingly, how do we know? I mean what if I select an ability, it has a pre-req, and I think, "Cool, now there's something that I wanted, and is important to my character, and I've already got it." Rather, does the fact that something's a pre-req automatically mean it's not a flag?<br/>
<br/>
Is your definition of flag something that can be seen to be a flag?<br/>
<br/>
If so, then that's what we're talking about here. Coming up with a term for a thing that the player wishes was a flag, but doesn't appear to be one, or something that the player isn't sure is a flag, but turns out to be one. Calling them a resource is not definitive of this property. Hit Points are a player resource, but they're never going to be flags. Unwanted pre-reqs are never going to be flags. They might be important parts of play. But they're not the "potential flags" that I'm talking about (and I think Mark is talking about).<br/>
<br/>
I think there's value in having lots of this sort of thing, and that it's worth looking into. I think that characters that are all flags tend to lack depth. Because we only see (typically) "what's important about the character now." With no room to develop into other issues. Which is important for the sorts of long-term play that I like.<br/>

                            Imagine a game with a web of traits that are on the surface abilities (e.g. "Strong"). Further imagine that those traits get stronger when the player puts them on the line by making them an issue to be resolved (e.g. "Am I stronger than my father thinks I am?") Puts them on the line, because once that issue becomes resolved the trait will morph into at least one trait upon resolution depending on how powerful it was during gameplay:<br><br>Strong ("Am I stronger than my father thinks I am?") ----Power 1 (Resolved by failing father and being ostracized) -----&gt; Alone<br><br>or<br><br>Strong ("Am I stronger than my father thinks I am?") ----Power 2 (Resolved by failing father and being ostracized for allowing him to die -------&lt; Alone and Masochistic<br><br>etc.<br><br>If all traits evolved in this way, and gameplay was about playing your character at different times in their life, you could have instances where you discovered why you became Strong.<br><br>But also, the point I guess, is that you can have Dead End traits. That is, you have an ability you want. But you could make it a Flag by assigning an issue to it and be rewarded for it. Furthermore, if you had a trait that you didn't want anymore, you could make some issue about it "Why do you have those tattoos when you know you won't get a job with them?") and transform it into something you did want to get to eventually make into a Flag.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
