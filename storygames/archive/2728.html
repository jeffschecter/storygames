So, I thought I'd toss the bare bones of what I have out here for you Story Game geniuses to chew on.  I've seen some pretty hot stuff come out of the Awesom-o-fy  threads so I'm pretty sure there a kick ass idea out there that I can run with.  Before continuing, let me post the 2 paragraph blurb describing what I'm thinking thus far...<br/><br/>300 years ago they came, falling from the sky in uncountable legions.  The Elohim, winged giants of incredible strength, swept away all resistance to their arrival.  They enslaved or destroyed anyone in their path.  No one knew who they were or where they came from but their intent was clear; invasion and occupation.  Every civilization fell before them.  The remnants were driven into the caves and dark places below ground to eke out an existence away from the power of the Elohim.<br/><br/>Old societies have died but new societies have arisen.  In a place where light, water, food and even air are precious commodities, life is a brutal struggle for survival.  The races and cultures living in the lightless world below are in constant competition for space and very limited resources.  And still there are the Elohim above.  They live in the stolen light of the surface world and all those who live in the dark want their revenge.<br/><br/>--------------------------<br/><br/>Okay.  I'm describing my setting as post-apocalyptic fantasy.  While I rather like the generalities of the setting I'm having trouble coming up with specific hooks that really grab players and make them want to play.  Here are a couple of things I've kicked around with Andrew Morris...<br/><br/>1.) A new magic source has been discovered far below ground that represents a power that might defeat the Elohim.  Characters are all connected to the magic source in some way and must deal with the political fallout of this new source while simultaneously taking the fight to the invaders that live on the surface.<br/><br/>2.) There is a prophecy (that I would actually write and include in the game text) and all characters are associated with one or more pieces of the prophecy.  The text is vague enough that the specifics of how that works out in play would be interesting but constraining enough to give some direction to the game.  Think Star Wars and the whole "He will return balance to the Force." kind of thing.  It sounded great but was a little rough on the Jedi in execution.<br/><br/>What I want out of this thread...<br/><br/>I'm really just looking for some brainstorming.  People here at Story Games seem good at that.  If I actually use any of the material that comes out of this thread, I'll definitely acknowledge that in the game text.  I'm looking for ideas in the setting that will really hook players.  Thanks in advance for any time and energy you guys put into this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62416/#Comment_62416" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T05:55:33+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  5:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An Elohim becomes outcast by his own people and driven into the underground near-death.

Others want to create a massive human slaughter at the hands of Elohim to force people to act (like how the dude from Amistaad wanted bad things to happen to THESE slaves, so that they would be a large, public example to have others rise up and throw down slavery in the long run.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>There are rumors of 'dragons' under the earth.

No heir has been announced. A slave of the Elohim, from the Imperial Household, escapes to the underground with news that the Elohim Emperor, who is gravely ill, plans to meditate in solitude amongst the ruins of humanity's once greatest city and then announce his heir. It is thought that he will be accompanied by no more than a small bodyguard and a few trusted advisers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf an elite band of underground warriors could assassinate the Elohim Emperor, there could be civil war amongst the Elohim.
