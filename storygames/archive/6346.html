To summarise: Sathar attack space station, Todak tries to find and stop them, and fails. He tries to escape, and does so, but only after being poisoned by a cop. He arrives on an unknown planet and tries to escape, before realising the guy who\u2019s healed him probably actually is his friend, and the hideout he\u2019s in gets attacked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat went well:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really felt like we were writing a story together. The Pool\u2019s mechanics were great for that, and I think that myself and Simon were on the same wavelength from the start. We both pushed towards conflict pretty much all the time, without any pussyfooting around with meaningless interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was character development. Reading it again now, Todak\u2019s a bastard. Every NPC he\u2019s met, he\u2019s tried to kill or capture and interrogate. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d work out like that, but he seemed to grow as more stuff got thrown at him. By focussing on \u2018hey, this\u2019d be cool,\u2019 rather than, \u2018I think Todak\u2019d probably do this,\u2019 we both saw the game grow and change before our eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne player and one GM made the PBP schedule much more relaxed. If I couldn\u2019t post for a while, I could just let the other player know and we\u2019d not be letting the rest of the party down. Even now, the game\u2019s on a bit of a hiatus, and it still feels like we\u2019ll pick it up again someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo separation of IC and OOC threads \u2013 this is a technical PBP thing, but us just having the one post made the mechanics feel like a part of the background. I think that in PBP, players and GMs sometimes get a bit above themselves, thinking that their IC thread will basically be read as a story without the interference of the mechanics. When I read other PBP games, though, I want to know what the mechanics said. Like, \u2018Did he do that because he wanted to, or was that a result of conflict resolution?\u2019 It also made it easy to pick up and post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140545/#Comment_140545" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-20T08:11:48+00:00" title="April 20, 2008  8:11AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What didn\u2019t go so well:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a bit relentless. I guess having some more players might have meant Todak could\u2019ve had some scenes at a slower pace, or that they\u2019ll evolve in time if we keep playing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rolled really badly at one point and lost a bunch of Pool points. My philosophy in risking them was just when I had a cool idea that I wanted to see happen, and I lost about three rolls in a row where I\u2019d risked a lot of dice. That made me play it a bit safe after that, which was a bit disappointing, and it made me take the extra pool die when I did succeed, rather than taking a MOV, which really sucked, both for me and Simon. Maybe this was just me panicking and going all gamist. Or maybe I\u2019m just a pussy when it comes to risking my all. In PBP, it would\u2019ve taken me an age (of real time) to build my Pool up again, so I didn\u2019t risk it. If I tried it again, I might go with The Anti-Pool, just to give it some balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the game\u2019s hit a bit of a pause now. I think both of us got a bit busy. We might come back to it one day, or we might not. It really worked, though, and I\u2019d do it again, maybe in a different setting or slightly different system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140575/#Comment_140575" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-20T16:33:43+00:00" title="April 20, 2008  4:33PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi  Guy,<br/><br/>Thanks for posting this AP report.  I'd been feeling guilty about not posting to the game for a while, so I'm really happy to talk about it here for a while.<br/><br/>I think you're right about the "relentless" pace.  I've been really enjoying the game, but, as with many games with only two players, there's a lot of pressure to keep coming up with new stuff.  I think it was compounded by those poor rolls making you (rightly) decline monologues of victory through the last few interactions. <br/><br/>Usually in the Pool, when your pool is low you go out and get into some low-impact conflicts in your area of expertise to pump up again (a bit like a refresh scene in TSoY).  I think because we were playing by PBP, we were both reluctant to spend time on non-critical conflicts.  That made for a pretty intense game, but it also meant that when your pool got wiped out, you didn't get much chance to recharge.<br/><br/>I totally agree with you about the pleasure of discovering a character through play.  I think it's something that actually happens in most roleplaying games, but some of them try to sweep it under the table a little.  You're "supposed" to know everything about your character at the start of the game (including pages of back-story), and reveal that through play.  WHat usually happens is that you get a feel for the character as you play, and then pretend it's been like that all along.  I think what a lot of indie games do (and the Pool does to some extent), is to put that process out in the open.  When I saw "read surface thoughts and emotions" on the character sheet, I though Todak was going to be an empathic type, and we'd see lots of Todak being deeply affected by others' pain.  What actually happened was really differerent.  I liked to think that Todak's power had been so "weaponised" by the last Sathar war, that he didn't know how to use it any other way.<br/><br/>All of my successful PBP experiences have been either two-player, or anyone-can-play.  I think that the dynamics of PBP are radically different to tabletop play, and design (including the parameters of individual games, as well as the game's rules) need to reflect that.   <br/><br/>We should definitely pick this up again.  Maybe after Game Chef week?

I would imagine that the Anti-Pool _would_ work much better in a 1-on-1 situation like you have. It's no fun if one person ends up narrating all the time! Anti-Pool is a better "balancer"--you can't win OR lose all the time. (However, see a suggested hack below.)<br/><br/>2. As written, you're not supposed to add more than one trait to any roll! You guys have been piling them on. However, you've also had some really bad luck--at four dice, your odds of success are about 50%, and it looks like you were failing rolls at 6, 7, and 9 dice regularly. Maybe doing it that way isn't all that bad, especially in a 1-on-1 game. However, it ought to make a character really, really unstoppable within their area of specialty.<br/><br/>I also have a couple of Pool hacks that I am fond of. Maybe one of these might suit your game:<br/><br/>Pool Hack 1<br/><br/>--When you add dice to your Pool, you add _two_ dice instead of just one, unless your Pool has exceeded its beginning value. This gives the beginning value of your Pool some more meaning--when designing your character, do you want to invest in more traits, or have a bigger Pool?<br/><br/>(I came up with this one because I wanted to play a slightly more complex version of the Pool, with two or more Pools describing each character, like Daring and Disciplined, or Manic and Depressive, in which case their starting values must have some meaning or it's kind of pointless.)<br/><br/>Pool Hack 2<br/><br/>--When you take a MoV, you can gain up to three dice by describing complications for your character instead of outright success. So, your choices are:<br/><br/>1. Take the die. GM narrates.<br/>2. Take a MoV, narrate.<br/><br/>GM awards you dice if you narrate complications (or outright failure) for your character, as follows:<br/><br/>1 die: Yup, that's a complication, alright.<br/>2 die: Whoa! He's getting into a serious mess.<br/>3 dice: My jaw is on the floor. How are you going to get out of <i>that</i> one?<br/><br/>This last option might work really well for your 2-player PBP game. You could also set it up to reward something else, like fleshing out the particulars of alien species, creating interpersonal drama, explaining how technology works in the setting, or whatever you want to reward.<br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141021/#Comment_141021" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T00:15:11+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 12:15AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those hacks look good and would work well for PBP, and/or one-on-one. I've been thinking a bit about how the anti-pool might work, I reckon it might be a bit too regular for a one-on-one game... that is, it might have made the game too balanced, like we could've just taken it in turns to say what happens. The second hack, in particular, seems to delegate more world responsibility to the player, which is usually worth doing in pbp, when everyone's pretty keen on writing descriptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
