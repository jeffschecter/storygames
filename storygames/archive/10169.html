Boyd is in town, and we got together for an old-fashioned throwdown last night.  I wanted to put something together to play with him and naturally thought of Lady Blackbird.  Having recently hacked it into a historical game, I was all set to hack it into something else, and my thoughts turned to a gritty post-apocalyptic game.  I quickly <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/post-apocbird/post_apocbird.pdf" rel="nofollow">worked up four characters</a> all pointed at each other and a very simple situation - a grist mill co-op, a stable community, and their dangerous gangster neighbors.  I sweetened the pot by making the grist mill the target of a "hostile takeover", and threw some hostages into the mix.  That was all I had going in, so I did a ton of fishing and letting the players add information and details.  It went great, even though I got the die pool rules 100% backwards, which made every conflict more or less a cake-walk.  We were all "Aaaaaah that makes more sense" once we realized the error.  <br/><br/>My favorite moment was Eric, playing the lying, manipulative weasel Statesville Mike, buying off his Key of Cowardice when faced with the wrath of the warlord Clegg.  Clegg's minions were about to lop off his hand and Statesville Mike pulled out a grenade he'd stolen, popped the pin, and earned two advances.  <br/><br/>Because I had essentially no background or color going in, I surprised myself, too.  They met Clegg's chief lieutenant, a ne'er-do-well named Zanni, and when they asked how old he was I said "18".  From this it developed that most of Clegg's troops were dead-eyed child soldiers who had come up on unending war after the collapse.  <br/><br/>I really like the way Lady Blackbird encourages a bit of narrative flourish as you struggle to incorporate tags.  I like the buckets of dice.  Everybody liked conditions, but they didn't get a lot of use (probably because they have no mechanical weight).  It's a fun system that really took the best from its sources and I'd love to see it streamlined, maybe better explained, and put in a form that would allow quick pick up play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225862/#Comment_225862" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T11:48:46+00:00" title="August 19, 2009 11:48AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for running this, Jason - I had a great time! Remi's Gert was so entertaining as the reckless, bloodthirsty badass and her eventual transformation into a pillar of her community was perfect. Andy's James abandoning his community to take control of the leaderless child soldiers was another awesome end that surprised and delighted me. Good stuff all around guys. <br/><br/>I'd really like to try the system again to see how the difficulties balance out when done properly. We had a blast succeeding at just about everything, but the conditions and such got short shrift as a result. Jason's post-apoc NC was an awesome setting hack - I recently read <i>The Road</i> so I was feeling the grimy, broken down vibe.<br/><br/>I've got to find my way out to NC more than once every couple years : )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225987/#Comment_225987" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T14:41:31+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  2:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoyed this game. I'm sorry we weren't playing the personal dice right, because it would have led to more flashback/refresh scenes, which I think would have really strengthened the non-mission bonds between our characters.<br/><br/>I hadn't played with Eric before and he was super-clever at playing Statesville Mike. Mike (the Coward and Liar) grabbed some unmarked grenades early in the game. Later, when gang boss Clegg threatened to chop off his hand, Mike reached into his pocked, held up a grenade, and ripped the pin out. Mike slammed his grenade hand down on the table and said, "Go ahead, chop it off." Totally great moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226059/#Comment_226059" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T19:28:30+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  7:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other cool things about that game:<br/><br/>1) Joey, the other player at the table: It was the first time any of us met or gamed with him; he actually looked me up on Nearbygamers.com, and that was the first time we met. Solid player, down with the frenzy. It was a good time.<br/><br/>2) Eric switching in and out of character was like watching a person change hats. It was really cool.<br/><br/>3) It opened my eyes *even more* to the whole "adventure and characters in a box" setup of Lady Blackbird. I've been loosely tooling around with some game ideas, and I realized that better than making them into their own "full game", I'm going to come up with a tight, easy rules system like the one behind LB, and craft a directed scenario. This kind of thing really is another RPG evolutionary step.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226069/#Comment_226069" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T20:25:05+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  8:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

I just looked again at the original Blackbird files, and I think that there might have been an underlying problem: Your aspects (or whatever they're called: The descriptors we used to gain dice that are attached to the role) were *too stackable*. Looking over at Lady Blackbird, it looks like some pains were taken to make sure that they were "spread out", and not readily applicable. And while I can see that maybe one character who is crazy-good at one thing might be able to stack up a bunch of their descriptors, it seemed that a lot of us had at least one thing we could do (Gert = Crunching People, Mike = Conning People, Jake = Leading People, Joey's character = Dirty Tricks While Fighting People) to a degree where we were *easily*, without trying very hard, pulling in 5-6 dice per roll. Whereas looking at the original LB sheets, it appears to be *much harder* to do that without really stretching out the situation or description to accommodate those descriptors.<br/><br/>My suggestions, either:<br/>1) Take a second look at the descriptors, and slim down the lists a bit.<br/>2) Perhaps better, do the same as 1, but create another Aspect for each character, and perhaps move some of the overlap from the other aspects into the new aspect?<br/><br/>Just a thought. But still, I had a lot of fun, and honestly I don't mind the fact that we were winning a lot, it was very satisfying in contrast to many of the "boo hoo I'm all emo while failing at everything" games we often play. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226201/#Comment_226201" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T08:57:17+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  8:57AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, Andy.  I am definitely going to revisit the Traits and their Tags.  Harper had some good advice about how to structure these (in terms of the sweet spot for the number of tags likely to be invoked) but I've lost it at the moment.  It's an interesting puzzle, because a clever player can craft a situation where even disparate tags apply (Remi did that once, when he was leading the hostages to safety, to good effect).  I think I erred on the side of too many, too similar, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kakupacal" title="kakupacal"><img alt="kakupacal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kakupacal">kakupacal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226268/#Comment_226268" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T11:49:15+00:00" title="August 20, 2009 11:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How were you using the dice pools incorrectly?
