They're pretty things and are one of the most beautiful ways to show off art. However, indie games don't always have GMs and almost never require keeping secrets.<br/><br/>What would a GM screen for an indie game? If you need a specific game, pick one and explain what a GM screen would look like for that.<br/><br/>Now, whatever this thing is, it needn't be <i>for the GM</i>. And neither need it be <i>a screen</i>. But I would like something that works as a reference tool and, crucially, stands up  vertically.<br/><br/>Even better, give me something that isn't just a vertically-standing reference tool but, I don't know, enhances the game in some way.

Cortex Plus doesn't really have as much of those, and in fact because the GM rolls dice in front of the players and they generally need to see his dice, it makes a screen less useful.

(Re)establishing trust, breaking down barriers, cutting the secrecy and mindgames. The DM's screen was part of that divide.<br/><br/>Trail has a screen, right? Apocalypse World could easily have one, with the agenda, principles, moves, fronts, lists of stuff and tags, barter etc. Since the MC doesn't roll dice, the screen wouldn't need to conceal his rolls, which is great.<br/><br/>Having a stand-up screen between the GM and the players has its uses and effects and we can certainly use them cautiously and to good effect. Having a screen to hide rolls and create barriers "just 'cause" is bad imo. <br/><br/>As a semi-aside: Foldable character sheets for FATE fall into this territory in a way, the ones that show your Aspects to the table. In general, I think here have been a lot of improvements in the presentation of character sheets in recent years - character sheets can look cool, and be reference documents and many other things besides just forms and numbers. Lady Blackbird, Apocalypse World playbooks, the aforementioned FATE sheets. It's amazing what a little good layout and design can do. The sheets for D&amp;D 4Essentials look much better and more functional than the old ones and the character cards they have for Encounters look great and could even be fully functional for regular games if you'd ditch the art. WHFRP3's sheets and cards are worth mentioning.<br/><br/>So yay for having more rules/references and play materials readily available on "secondary" materials such as sheets, screens, cards etc so you can refresh your memory at a glance or be inspired by some elements instead of having to look it up in a book. Presentation is also important and I really like the "sense of theatre" (does the knife ritual in Mist-Robbed Gate count in this context?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314508/#Comment_314508" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T08:49:17+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  8:49AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2011 8:49AM by DainXB.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Cross-posted with Teataine) <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Back in the old days, a GM screen wasn't so much a screen to roll dice behind as it was a screen to hide the GM's notes and (mostly) maps from the players. You can generally trust players not to try to read your notes upside-down, but its actually hard not to spot the general features of a map.<br/><br/>Most indie games utilize a philosophy of open dice-rolling, and most indie games aren't map-heavy even if they feature extensive GM prep (like Dogs in the Vineyard). That leaves a stand-up screen as a reference tool, but most indie games don't have lots of charts and tables, or fiddly mechanical sequences, either...<br/><br/>Apocalypse World might benefit from a set of stand-up reference tools, since most of the moves have little tables attached to them.  An MC reference with art and the basic moves facing the players, basic, peripheral, and battle moves facing the MC might be handy. Maybe the harm list and the 'worth 1 barter' list could go on there too. The MC can use it to conceal his Fronts sheet and notes. The playbooks are all the reference the player's need, really, but stand-ups with character art facing the other players and space to clip custom moves or moves 'borrowed' from other playbooks on the inside might add to the sense of theatre Graham is looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314510/#Comment_314510" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T08:55:37+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  8:55AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

Smallville is deceptively simple (with many brilliant mechanics) but a lot of fiddly bits that change depending on what stage of a conflict you are in. The book itself is challenging to reference and a fully detailed cheatsheet with page numbers would be very helpful. And given the book doesn't have an index, a valuable add on. Our group wanted to give up playing and haven't yet because I've been insistent we hold on as I believe it will all end up being worth it. But so far that has required me creating my own references which I shouldn't (in my opinion) have to do.  <br/><br/>At Dreamation I talked to a few people who are playing Smallville and were playing it incorrectly (unintentionally). When I flipped through the book with them, they were surprised how much they missed. I think the game behind the text is great which is why these road bumps pain me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314600/#Comment_314600" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T19:37:34+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  7:37PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm now imagining a Lacuna GM screen with just all sorts of crazy writing and spiders and disturbing little things that you notice when you stare at it for a long time. <br/><br/>It'd give you a place to put all that secret info behind too, so it'd have a great purpose there as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314601/#Comment_314601" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T19:45:48+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  7:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>I'm now imagining a Lacuna GM screen with just all sorts of crazy writing and spiders and disturbing little things that you notice when you stare at it for a long time.<br/><br/>It'd give you a place to put all that secret info behind too, so it'd have a great purpose there as well.</blockquote>\nI think that's the major thing: GM screens are at their coolest when you both use the physical barrier between people to play to the game's strengths and have information that enhances the experience in some way.<br/><br/>I'm more than a little tempted to get one of those plastic GM screen things with pockets you can use for whatever you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314642/#Comment_314642" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T00:05:02+00:00" title="February 28, 2011 12:05AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just remembered that I wrote a game a while ago where the GM's rules would fit on half a page and the players' rules would fit on half a page and I put everything on one sheet and flipped one of the sections so you could fold the sheet and pop it in the middle of the table so everyone could see their rules and "what do you do" instructions all the time.

So when you're control, you watch for your list of stuff, and mark when the static increases.  Then others take control as GM, and you don't know what the static level is until the GM screen gets back around to you, and you're like "Whoah, it's that high already?!?"  And there are weird notes about how one NPC is secretly made of old clocks and planning on betraying the PCs to the Spidermen, or whatever.<br/><br/>Or in something like Danger Mountain!, each person has their chosen disaster scenario, and mark off the "disaster foreshadowing track" when their thing is foreshadowed by what happens in a scene.  When the track fills up, then the disaster strikes... the disaster of whoever is GM at the moment.  Same thing could work for a murder mystery: every clue that points toward your explanation increments the "clue track" until you have enough evidence to convict someone.<br/><br/><br/>I think the rotating GM screen might be interesting, in part because there is some secret info that eventually gets disseminated out to everyone.  But it doesn't get spread out equally, all at once.  Some of the table might know what's going on, while some might not.  But a few scenes later, I'll get the screen, see the notes and have some minor epiphanies, while other people are in the dark for the moment about new plot threads and developments. It gives you a different information flow paradigm somewhere between "all open information" and "the GM holds all the secrets".<br/><br/>EDIT: It's a bit like the story game equivalent of <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30618/eat-poop-you-cat" rel="nofollow">Eat Poop You Cat</a> (a folk game that goes by a lot of different names).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314770/#Comment_314770" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T14:16:33+00:00" title="February 28, 2011  2:16PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2011 2:16PM by JDCorley.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The key to a screen being useful is for it to conceal something - ordinarily die rolls, notes and so forth.

With two pages, I can put them in a sheet protector which makes them stiff, and makes them easy to separate from my game notes. With more sheets, it becomes a problem.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel has a PDF of pages for a GM screen... I produced a 4 page reference that I printed on tabloid paper so it can be folded into a booklet, and maintains some of the single sheet in a page protector nature. But I never use it. In the end, in Burning Wheel it seems easier to look up the charts as I need them in the books.<br/><br/>An interesting thought - if the references could be reduced to some index cards, have a bar with a slot in it, put the index cards you need for a scene standing in the bar, which gets the vertical feature of a GM screen while being low enough for everyone to see over. For GMing in a living room setting, have a lap desk with the slot in near the top (with a handy caddy at the top or one side for the extra index cards).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314793/#Comment_314793" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T15:57:38+00:00" title="February 28, 2011  3:57PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Pitre</cite>Ohh, what if you had a game entirely (or almost entirely) produced in the format of Screens.
