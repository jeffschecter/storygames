I'm writing a new column for RPGnet called "Issues &amp; Trends," covering recent developments in roleplaying design and play.  The first article is about endings, specifically White Wolf's recent focus on limited-run game lines with fixed endings and small press games' post-<i>My Life With Master</i> trend of having established endgames and limited-run campaigns.  I'm trying to write the part about the different approached to endgames that are out there, sorting them into different groups.<br/><br/>My first group is the ones directly influence by MLWM's "countdown/up" system of having traits that measure how far you are from the endgame and then, once the endgame starts, help determine how the finale and epilogue are narrated.  Prominent games in this group include Polaris, Breaking the Ice, 1001 Nights, Roanoke, and even Bacchanal (in the way the dice provide a countdown, with endgame/death becoming increasingly likely the longer you play).<br/><br/>The second group comes from The Mountain Witch, with a fixed number of chapters with fixed numbers of scenes within them, after which the game ends.  I think Burning Empires is the most clear descendant of this tradition.  Primetime Adventures is also somewhat related, in the way you plan out a season in advance.  PTA doesn't really have special endgame rules for a "season finale" though (at least, as I recall), so it's a different beast in a couple ways.  PTA also has "session framing" in addition to "campaign framing" but that's not really relevant to this article.<br/><br/>Jason Morningstar may have a tradition all of his own with The Roach and Grey Ranks, where every scene/act is planned out in the game text and the players simply run the characters through them until they reach the end.  I'm not aware of any other games that do this, but I could be wrong.<br/><br/>There are some character-specific ways to end a campaign, like Transcendence in TSOY or meeting your fate in Agon, but I don't see these as that different than mechanically occurring character death, even if they are slightly more voluntary, because they end the game for a specific character but not the entire group.<br/><br/>Are there any major games or styles of endgame that I'm missing?  I haven't read every game under the sun, so I might have missed a few.<br/><br/>Also, I'm interested in endgame-like implementations in more mainstream games, whether influenced by indie games or not.  Specifically, I heard some stuff about campaign framing in Promethean, but I haven't really been able to verify that.  Is there an endgame in Promethean and how does it work?  If nobody here knows, I may have to go ask at RPGnet.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105152/#Comment_105152" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T15:09:14+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  3:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Poison'd</i> uses a hybrid method.

At least one of these paths involved starting over in new careers--advancing to 12th level three times in a row.  At which point you become immortal.  And then there are 36 levels of immortality.  But some immortals get bored, and decide to reincarnate as mortals again.  Then if they advance to 36th level again, and do the whole 12th level three times more, and then advance through 36 levels of immortality -- well, then, having gone through 216 levels of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, they declare "You have Won the Game."<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hope that someone, somewhere, actually did this playing more or less by the book.

Dust Devils was pretty early on with the Devil and The End. It's pretty comparable to character death, and is in many ways indirectly related to the controlling player's choices. <br><br>44 has an actual countdown mechanic that literally ticks down each phase. But, it's really MLWM in disguise. There's really not much difference. It does have one thematic difference in that it feels like a Hitchcock-esque tension amplifier.<br><br/>But, I think the one notable one is Nine Worlds. There is an end game mechanic there that is comparable to Transcendence in some ways. But, the really  interesting thing here is that the controlling player has full choice and input on the process. He or she designates an existing Muse as the end game signifier. When the Muse resolves, the player enters end game. It is not random. It loads a specific thematic choice into the end game resolution (picking THIS Muse, or THAT one, etc. says something really interesting about what the player values and what matters to his/her character).                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105178/#Comment_105178" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T22:41:46+00:00" title="October 27, 2007 10:41PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the help so far!  This is all great.<br/><br/>So it looks like there's really two major schools, from what people have been saying: mechanical counters and explicit structures.<br/><br/>The character based ones (Dust Devils, Charnal, PTA, Nine Worlds, Mu, Agon, Bliss, Poison'd) lie somewhere in between, but are often more closer to being mechanical counters.  They generally operate on an individual level, so the other players can continue playing even if one character's story is over, but the dramatic loss of a key character certainly effects the game.  I may end up writing a separate article on "making death fun," so this is good stuff to know about, even if it doesn't make it into this initial column installment.<br/><br/>Another question: is there an implied endgame in Sorcerer when you reach a certain Humanity threshold or is it open ended?  Sorry, it's been a while since I read Dev's copy.  I assume, if it's there, it's more character-specific (like Transcendence in TSOY or Golchonda in Vampire or insanity in Call of Cthulhu) and not campaign specific, unless you're playing with 2 players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105195/#Comment_105195" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-28T07:59:03+00:00" title="October 28, 2007  7:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In default Sorcerer, I guess hitting 0 Humanity is like an inverse Transcendence: the core rules establish that your character drops out of the game and becomes unplayable.
