(I'm not nearly as long-winded as Jonathan, so this message is nothing like as detailed as his run-down of the Agonia game.) I learned a lot from the experience, and I really appreciate your willingness to playtest this work-in-progress. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got off to a somewhat rough start. The game is a good bit more crunchy than I'd realized, and I felt a surge of panic as I realized just how many rules I needed to walk us all through in the process of character creation. A possible solution would be to hand out pregenerated characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe began with some basic world-creation, each of us creating an NPC. Brennan suggested afterwards that this might be done more effectively if it were collaborative, and if an effort was made as each new NPC is added, to establish how he or she is connected with at least one previous NPC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn't until a little ways into actual play (well after character and world-creation) that the players began to work out the game's modus operandi. There were some brilliant moments once the pieces fell in place; I especially enjoyed Neil's successful use of a Fate Card to bring into being an NPC who would insult the daughter of a man he was interested in impressing: he called out the blackguard, finished him off in a duel, then took advantage of the resultant bonus to press his new patron to commit, at least conditionally, to help him obtain a military commission as Captain in the Royal Navy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNick, a visitor from Seattle, demonstrated the caffeine-powered mojo for which his native city is famous by viciously wounding Brennan's reputation and then (no less coldly and calculatingly) wooing a young woman of a lower social rank whose father could help advance his political career.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't mention some of the other attempted exploits, as at least one of them would be inappropriate to discuss in mixed society. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Fate Deck proved to be one of the most popular mechanics in the game. The Pecking Order gave people something to do, both to advance themselves and hurt other people. I noticed that the skill mechanic, which allows you to accomplish a given goal (make friends, wound someone's reputation, etc.) by using any of a variety of skills, meant that people tended to use the same skill over and over \u2014 one in which they had a particularly high +. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I welcome your comments and constructive criticism \u2014 or simply your reminiscences about what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2014 Chuck Henebry                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155832/#Comment_155832" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T11:27:35+00:00" title="July 10, 2008 11:27AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game sounds cool.<br/><br/>I think that's about all I've got to say, other than an enthusiastic "Let's see some stuff from the people who participated!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155842/#Comment_155842" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T11:59:02+00:00" title="July 10, 2008 11:59AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds very interesting.

I've heard great things about your own work from several of the people at Story Games Boston, and I'd love to get your input on the game I'm developing. I don't yet have a website, but that's not a bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost all the characters ended the session by making a major proposal of one kind or another: a career advancement or a marriage. Most of these proposals ended in a qualified "yes," which is to say that the suitor was sent away with hope that, if he accomplished some particular (read: ridiculous) task, he might reapply. Nick's proposal was the exception, receiving an unqualified yes, no doubt because he was proposing to a woman of lesser social rank, making her all the more ready to leap rather than look\u2014as she probably should have done. Proposals takes a modifier from the difference in social standing, though in an upcoming draft I'm planning to add a mechanic which would make the response of NPCs to marriage proposals a bit more variable, dependent on factors like temper (Romantic vs. Pragmatic, "Sense" vs. "Sensibility", etc.). Everyone else who proposed was trying to marry (or begin a career) above their own class, and thereby achieve their victory condition. It's worth noting that Nick didn't satisfy his victory condition either, precisely because his marriage was beneath him, and simply a stepping stone along the way to the political career he had set as his goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nI should add that this game was run at Pandemonium Games in Cambridge MA, and was organized by Story Games Boston. I'm new to these boards, and didn't realize it was a national and even international forum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155926/#Comment_155926" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T15:29:50+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  3:29PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is a fact universally acknowledged, that any piece of literature in possession of a large audience must be in need of a storygame.<br/><br/>And this one sounds like a great match - polite, indirect facestabbing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
