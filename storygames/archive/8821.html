It has a lot of tragic gut-punch potential, but all 3 of the games I've been a part of have also had great moments of brotherhood, bonding, and laughter, exploring both humanity and inhumanity. All of the games I've been a part of have also had a certain amount of unevenness in terms of players being really plugged into the story. Ideally the spotlight is shared, but in reality, <i>what</i> to spotlight is the tricky part. The "what" comes largely from burdens and not all burdens are created equal. Some burdens are easy to bring into play, and others are difficult to highlight, not only for the GM, but for the player as well.<br/><br/>One type of burden that seems cool but is hard to make an active part of the fiction is the "girlfriend back home." Letters from home can be brought into play adding emotional moments, but it's hard to actively deal with it. It would make a better burden if it also involved a local girlfriend or struggling with homosexuality or something like that.<br/><br/>In a recent thread, Joshua A.C. Newman was theorizing that burdens involving local relationships would be a good idea. I completely agree. If you have a friend in the village, a secret VC girlfriend, a problem with a squad member, etc., it's easy to become emotionally involved and frames scenes around or with that person. <br/><br/>I think burdens that involve personal shortcomings or shame can be great too. But the trick with them, I think, is to make sure they don't stay secret. That is, you make sure someone finds out, or you actively jeopardize your secret so the fun comes from the possibility of being discovered. This also definitely requires a proactive approach as a player, since the GM may not hit all the right notes.<br/><br/>So. I'd like to have more concrete advice to give future players when the time comes to author their own and each other's burdens. What burdens worked well for you (and why)? What burdens sucked or seemed cool but were hard to play out (and why)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195129/#Comment_195129" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T15:04:02+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  3:04PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played all of once, so take this with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>I wrote a variant of the "girlfriend back home" burden (I was Ram; my wife and I had waited to have a child until I got promoted, but then she miscarried a month before I shipped out).  It didn't come directly into play until very late in the game, but when it did, I felt that it worked really well - and the way the burden scene played out it tied directly into a profile change that drove the final outcome of the game for Ram.  Of course, it was a letter from home moment  - which was fresh for me, but could get old.<br/><br/>I guess the only portable lesson I have is - you may be worrying too much about tying things directly into the fiction.  For me, at the table, Ram's relationship with his wife and feelings about children totally informed my understanding of him - especially the way that he played out his "stern father" role as leader of the unit.  I didn't bring it up much, but it was extremely meaningful to *me*.  It may be different for a player who needs more nudging to get engaged, of course - but for already engaged players, I think burdens can be powerful purely as "internal" considerations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195162/#Comment_195162" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T16:44:02+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  4:44PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have also played only once (in the same game as Daniel, for maximally poor sample size), so salt is required here too.

Fortunately, some kind soul spiked it by making it so that I'd already accidentally caused the death of an innocent man.  That had a lot more weight to it, and it showed.

I appreciate your different point of view here. I can definitely understand the value of burdens that are subtle in the narrative but powerful in how they shape the way you play. I am wondering, though, if that kind of subtlety works better for Ram than the other characters (and feel free to disagree, I'm just exploring here). That is, because Ram is always the highest ranking officer, when's he's in play, he's the one giving orders and such during the Action scenes. It all but guarantees that his player will have an active role in the game regardless of how awesome or lame his burdens are. That doesn't mean, of course, that the player is guaranteed an awesome experience overall, but even if the player isn't sure what to do in squad scenes or he gets overlooked, he'll definitely have the opportunity to contribute heavily to the Action. <br/>.<br/>I have little interest in turning this into a narrative vs. immersion discussion, but I find that, as with many other games, the moments in carry that are the most meaningful to be a part of or to watch are the ones that are shared - the failing or shame or conflict is right there for everyone to see. <br/><br/>A really engaged player like yourself might play hard with any and all tools given, but I want those players who aren't as motivated to have a great time too, and "subtle" is tricky to pull off well in any RPG. At least in terms of how others respond to you. The brooding soldier, for example, might be fun to play if you really get into the character's head, but it's not as much fun for the other people at the table if that means you're sitting there, quietly stewing for much of the time. <br/><br/>But this is where other tricks can make a character like that interesting for everyone (not that this is strictly necessary, but it feels fantastic when other people are interested in your character too). Bringing up the issue in in-character conversations, offering a monologue to explain what your character is thinking/feeling, or even verbalizing a "letter to home" are methods of handling more subtle/passive burdens in carry. <br/><br/>My goal is more geared toward helping less engaged players become more engaged, and if the burdens push towards clear action from the beginning, the GM will have an easier time making the game interesting, and so will the player.<br/><br/>Sam: Thanks, that's helpful, too. I've come across a few similar burdens to that and they were weak as well. I'm glad they worked out for you in the end. I think passive and future-oriented burdens are generally problematic, but I'm still thinking a lot of this out, so I'd love to hear more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195269/#Comment_195269" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T09:04:05+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  9:04AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really think this is about narrative vs. immersion and demand that we talk about it, ultimately ending in a fist-fight.  That's what I feel "my guy" would want in this conversation, even if it ruins everyone's fun.<br/><br/>Actually, I didn't have that at all in mind - Ram's burden wasn't an immersion issue for me, but precisely was part of how I crafted his part of the narrative.  But that aside... I can see your part about Ram's special role in the game, and you're probably right.  On top of it, yeah - I am a pretty aggressive player, and I didn't realize that you wanted to really focus in on the question of what makes a good burden for engaging folks in the fiction, as opposed to what makes a good burden in general - with one that's tightly tied to the situation being one *variety* of "good."<br/><br/>You're absolutely right about the brooding loner - I think, for an "internal" burden, one needs to adhere to a version of the Dogs rule that "the town will be revealed through play."  If you have a PC with a fascinating backstory that no one ever knows, it might be fun for that player, but there's got to be *something* for everyone else to grab on to (the gregarious, involved PC with a backstory no one ever learns is less of a problem).  I think I would have been failing in my obligations as a player had I not taken a couple actions that would have let people think, "oh, hey, THAT's why Ram was such a dick about that."  So maybe there's a lesson in that for players of private burdens - they need to think seriously about some way in which the burden will interact with and impact on their PC's reaction to the situation at hand, in a way that will (eventually) have some zing for other players.<br/><br/>One thing that I noticed - and this may just be my misunderstanding - is that the way burdens were presented sort of encouraged them to be about things not tied directly into the immediate situation.  I was thinking of them as things that are burdens one *carries into the war*, and so focused on things "from home," as it were.  An easy nudge might be to present burdens as things acquired over the course of the war (that one brings home in the epilogue) - that might put the focus more naturally on things like relationships to Vietnamese, issues with others in the army, bad character traits that are reactions to or exacerbated by conflict, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
