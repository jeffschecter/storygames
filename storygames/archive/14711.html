All the DJA nominees got played, though no one managed to play them all today.<br/><br/>I played <b>EFTAIOS</b> &amp; ran<b> Freemarket</b> (with some ad-hoc Mud Dragon, 7 Wonders, and some robot game thrown in).<br/><br/>-2.5 hours of our 4 hour <b>Freemarket</b> slot was taken up by character &amp; MRCZ creation. It could've gone faster, and I blame myself as Superuser for not keeping better track of time, but everyone still got to get a challenge in and it was all fun, if a lot to swallow in one session.<br/><br/>-<b>EFTAIOS</b> is excellent, and I'm going to buy it, without a doubt. We played a full 8 player game of it, and it was challenging, intense, and satisfying. I can't think of another game that works my brain quite the way EFTAIOS does.<br/><br/>-Harry's a champion for running both <b>Fiasco</b> &amp; <b>Dresden</b>, though sadly I couldn't play either.<br/><br/>-The people who played <b>Catacombs</b> seemed to have fun!<br/><br/>So, my vote? Only having played 2 out of the 5? It's...I can't decide. I love Freemarket, but I had more pure fun with EFTAIOS today. Yeah, I can't decide. I know at least those two are really deserving of the nomination, and I'm sure the others are as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335869/#Comment_335869" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-24T14:13:06+00:00" title="July 24, 2011  2:13PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's so cool seeing EFTAIOS being played and enjoyed so much around the world. The guys from Santa Ragione and Cranio are friends (we did some bit of cross promotion with Fiasco and Horse Fever)... be sure to check the online support for EFTAIOS Hans!<br/><br/>On their website you can find a flash map editor (dead easy to use), some downloadable maps, and maybe most importantly the Scenario Generator: a big list of a hundred or so rules. You pick which will apply to your scenario, click "done" and BAM, you have a new scenario just like those in the rulebook. And scenarios can *radically* change the game. <br/><br/>Aliens style marines coming in from the hatches to wipe out the aliens (humans can attack), for example.<br/>Or a Space Hulk style mission of "go, place the explosives at the center of the ship and run".<br/>Or... well, possibilities are really endless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335885/#Comment_335885" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-24T20:03:09+00:00" title="July 24, 2011  8:03PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EFTAIOS was super satisfying and was laser focused on its goal (which is high-speed, white knuckle, "oh god I'm going to die" action).  Copy was purchased between getting back to my friends house and falling asleep.  <br/><br/>Fiasco was a whole lot of fun but, like a bad story gamer, I'm not sure how I like it as an RPG.  Before everyone yells at me I really enjoyed myself and would definitely play it again, but I think I'd want either more Role Playing or more Game to have it be really satisfying.  <br/><br/>Freemarket continues to be a really hard game for me to do character creation in since it front-loads so much stuff without providing any sort of constraints but it was fun once we got going.  Hans and I had a really good conversation about half-way pre-genning characters in order to focus the game on the important details.  I'm glad I got to play since my copy has been languishing on my shelf since the preorder.<br/><br/>Word has it from the Catacombs group that great fun was had, and props to Harry for both a super quick DFRPG rules cram as well as hosting this shindig in the first place.<br/><br/>Of the three games I played I probably had the most fun playing EFTAIOS, but I think my vote would go to Freemarket for incentivising cooperation and <i>being nice</i> (also because I'm friends with Luke).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335909/#Comment_335909" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-25T03:45:52+00:00" title="July 25, 2011  3:45AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cathexis</cite><br/>Fiasco was a whole lot of fun but, like a bad story gamer, I'm not sure how I like it as an RPG.</blockquote>\nYou are Wrong on the Internet!
