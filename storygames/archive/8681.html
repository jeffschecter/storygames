My favorite piece was called <i>In Darkness He Is Waiting</i>, but there were several.  Unfortunately some of that might have been eaten when Thomas' server died.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192031/#Comment_192031" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T23:36:20+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 11:36PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 2:03AM by shreyas.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>In Darkness is the one worth seeing, methinks.

Some of the stuff I learned from the hero games is in there. Whisper me some contact info and I'll show you some things.</p>\n<p>Here's a snippet from Izumo that I particularly like, some of the text on Titles:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>How do you know how useful a Title is to you? Every Title occupies a particular position on your Fame list. Its position represents its prominence in the audience's mind. The higher up on the list a Title is, the more benefit you get from it. In other words, you only get a Title's benefits when the audience <em>remembers that you have them.</em></p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>It's a big exploration of how we can accomplish imperfectly-reliable narratorship in roleplaying.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192586/#Comment_192586" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T11:30:45+00:00" title="February 14, 2009 11:30AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On consideration, I think it was Torchbearer.
