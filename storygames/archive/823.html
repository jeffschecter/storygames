                    Play goes around the table/circle/what-have-you.<br/><br/>When it's your turn, you declare what you're doing.  ("I'm leaping from building to building, chasing the Gutbelcher!")  You only get to say <em>what</em> you're doing, not why.  Be descriptive and evocative, but don't be expressive.<br/><br/>The person to your left then explains <em>why</em> you did what you just did.  ("Ever since the Gutbelcher roasted your parents with his terrible breath, you've been on a quest for vengeance!")  They don't get to amend what you <em>do</em>, they only explain why you're doing it.  That person then segues into what they're doing.  ("And thus I, the Gutbelcher, laugh at your feeble attempts to catch up in my wake of destruction!").<br/><br/>And then the next person explains the significance of that ("The Gutbelcher has always had more talent for destruction than real creativity, and so destroys that which others create...")<br/><br/>Go around and around until you're bored or dizzy or done.<br/><br/><b>Point being:</b> Separates the choices you make from the significance of the things that you do.  Underscores how much you do not control "your" character, for whom you make choices, and actually control the character of the person to the right, since you're narrating all the whys and wherefores that undergird the character.                </div>

                            Cool, I see how this ties into the other thread that spawned it.  The idea of providing context to another person's actions is core to a bunch of improv games, too.  You could argue that heightening a scene is all about this kind of mutual support.<br/><br/>There's also a game ("What are you doing?") that expressly divorces action from context - if you actually describe what you are doing rather than something totally different, you lose.                        </div>

Thomas, the why is the significance-- playing this out, I expect you'll find that the whys are not only more emotionally powerful but set the course of the later game much more than the actions.                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>I'm torn.  I freely acknowledge that "Why?" is a huge deal.  I mean, shooting someone because you want to test your gun and shooting someone because they killed your family have two radically different emotional resonances.  But...<br/><br/>If you aren't <i>doing</i> things.  If there is no "What?" then you're failing at that old fiction addage of "show don't tell".  So it seems that "what?" is vitally important to play.  Maybe even <i>just as important</i> as "why?".<br/><br/>I guess I feel that you need both, and it's hard to call one significant and the other not.  I mean, just as if it makes a huge difference to the story if I shoot someone out of vengence, or if I shoot someone because I'm just the kind of bastard who shoots people to see if my gun works.  It also makes a huge difference if I forgive someone for killing my family, or punch them in the face, or torture them to death.<br/><br/>Aren't they both significant?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas, it seems to me you're conflating the message and the medium (which, if you're on the ball when you create/write/act/sing/whatever, you fuse together so they're complementary and nigh-inseparable).  Certainly the <em>what happens</em> is necessary and important.  It's the medium that signifies the message -- but it is not the message itself.  To get totally semiological, it's the signifier, not the signified.<br/><br/>I'm not talking about the relative merit or worth of one thing over the other.  I'm just drawing a distinction between the two things, trying to display how they work differently even as they work together, so that we have a better understanding of how the unit as a whole works.<br/><br/>(This is totally me being hair-splitting with language, I feel I ought to point out.  I'm not using "significance" as a synonym for "importance."  I'm using it to mean "thing being signified".)                        </div>

<i>(This is totally me being hair-splitting with language, I feel I ought to point out. I'm not using "significance" as a synonym for "importance." I'm using it to mean "thing being signified".)</i><br/><br/>It totally seems like you started out with the sort of significance that has more resonance with important than that which you are now using.  As in, "why is this significant?" = "Why is it *worth* attending to it?"  The exercise reveals how the action's significance, its import in the narrative, changes depending on the reason given for its occurrence.<br/><br/>To answer Thomas--it is significant because it develops just that narrative freight.  In other words, the 'why' gives the action a significance outside of its mere happening.  <br/><br/><i>Certainly the what happens is necessary and important. It's the medium that signifies the message -- but it is not the message itself. To get totally semiological, it's the signifier, not the signified.</i><br/><br/>No, what happens may be either the signified or the signifier, depending on your reference point.  The question of signification (in the semiological sense) doesn't really need to be raised here, though.  Going down this track gets us further away from what the exercise actually does.  <br/><br/>Thomas: The whole point of it is that by giving the action a why, a reason, it becomes significant.   I think you are right that you need both an action and a why, but that, in game, the significant actions are significant because of an implicit why.  In other words, I may not say that "I'm shooting this guy to revenge my family" but the action lets everyone infer that nonetheless. <br/><br/>The "show don't tell" adage does not demand a story have no why (that would be kind of silly), but encourages you to show the action in a way that makes the why clear without you having to explain it.  In other words, to portray the case so well that the why is 'written' in the action itself.  It's not a hard and fast rule.  Its value is heuristic--most often, if you *can't* show without a lot of telling, you are showing badly, leaving too much undeveloped.<br/><br/>This, however, is an exercise, and as such it highlights one side of that equation for instructive purposes.  Just like doing katas in martial arts--it isn't the katas themselves, which are abstracted from application, but the way in which after the kata you are better able to execute them in a more dynamic, 'real world' scenario.                        </div>
