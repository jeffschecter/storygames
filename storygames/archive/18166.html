This will get you ready to play in 20 minutes.</li>\n<li>The full Temple of Ungu scenario converted to Fate Core. That means mainly the NPC/monsters converted to Fate core.</li>\n<li>Currently missing, but it will have Treasure cards, just like in the original Temple of Ungu.</li>\n</ul>\nSome texts are directly copied over from the original Temple of Ungu, but I didn't find copyright information in it. I hope i am not doing anything illegal sharing this.<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwQTXvuCVa1mdkYtTFZrTGlIanM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Download here.</a><br/><br/>I am actually looking for feedback. If you have any opinion, i would like to read it. But i am also looking for specific details, like, for example why you like some aspect, why you don't. How you would do anything different. Also, i am not a native English speaker, so if you find a place where the text doesn't make sense, please also let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
