I was apprehensive about playing, but just wanted to mention, quickly, that it's bloody good.<br/><br/>Firstly, there's a real sense of theatre about it. Nobody seems to talk about this, but it's great, and not something you see often in indie games. For example, the GM gets to decide your name. That's really cool and slightly weird. Then the GM leaves the room while you decide your goals. That is cool too.<br/><br/>There's the Skull Die, that sits in the middle of the table. You can roll it any time you want, for a bonus, but if it rolls a 1, you die. (We played that, if you touch it, you must roll it. I don't know if that's in the rules, but it's fun.) This is one of the most theatrical, cool things I've seen in a game.<br/><br/>Secondly, the game is not preachy. I feared that, when we played Steal Away Jordan, we'd get self-indulgent: oh, I'm a slave, look how awful my life is. (Not that slavery isn't awful, you understand, but you don't necessarily want to play a game about awfulness.)<br/><br/>It's not like that. You play people with goals: now, admittedly, you're fighting against overwhelming odds for these goals. But, because you're fighting for your goals, it's a very <i>hopeful</i> game.<br/><br/>I had real doubts about Steal Away Jordan before playing. Instinctively, I thought it wouldn't be a game for me, but I was completely wrong. It's fun stuff and one of the most interesting games I've played for a while.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>P.S. Sorry, this post is a bit rambly. I can't find a way to write it that doesn't sound like "Hey, guys, slavery can be fun!". That is not <i>quite</i> what I'm saying, but it is a fun game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153015/#Comment_153015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T16:41:38+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  4:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2008 4:42PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the info, the theatrical stuff sounds really neat.

I had some problems with what I perceived to be statistical issues with the rules, but it turned out I was wrong. Some of the rules text could do with a little polish, but nothing much. Even if you find the rules preachy (which I don't) the actual play that emerges is about people who are enslaved rather than slaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was very strange to see players turn their ideas down to avoid my gaze when we were doing master-slave scenes, and the little things they did just to keep some pride and dignity were gratifying. The slaves' secret agendas were very effective - I tried hard not even to consider what those agendas might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were lots of good scenes but one favourite was the death of the overseer, and how the other slaves helped the root doctor cause his downfall. The house slave leant a few dice by polishing the stairs extra shiny, another slave made sure the overseer was in his cups, and the instigator came round late at night mock him. The overseer tumbled down the stairs drunk and smashed his head on the balustrade.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153348/#Comment_153348" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T10:01:42+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 10:01AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>which emphatically suggests that SAJ is not fun</blockquote>\nBut good "not fun" or bad "not fun"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153351/#Comment_153351" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T10:05:58+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 10:05AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2008 10:06AM by Hituro.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>But good "not fun" or bad "not fun"?</blockquote>\nUmm ...

It's one thing to be an audience member, but it's another thing to be the active creator of dramatic moments -- even if they are sad or dreadful moments.  There is a pleasure to be found in the act of creation, the building of patterns, of making choices that are surprising and that "click."<br/><br/>From everything I've read about <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> (I've yet to play it), I'm sure it delivers these moments for the firing of synapses in our brains that go, "Ah, that was good, here's some pleasure."<br/><br/>Thus, the subject matter is one thing (and, as Graham points out, to be respected), but <i>the act of play</i> is another thing -- and has its own specific and unique rewards.<br/><br/><br/>On another point, I think Graham nails it rather plainly.  The Characters have goals. The stakes are high.  The opposition great.  Boom.  Good story.  Good story = fun. [Edited in light of Julia's post directly below: I think "fun" is often a tricky word.  I prefer, when talking about my response to movies, games and books the words "engaging," "engagement," "pleasure" or "pleasing."  The feeling of "fun" is one quality or subset of these other words for me.  In the example Julia links to, she's right, it wasn't "fun."  But I do see "engagement" in spades.  And I think this creates "pleasure" in us -- the pleasure of a communal experience, the pleasure of creation, the pleasure of building something that is <i>right</i> even if it's sad.]<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153374/#Comment_153374" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T11:29:37+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 11:29AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>whether a non-gamer would "get" SAJ just from reading the text?</blockquote>\nI would hope so.

I hadn't thought about it like that before.  My most recent thoughts about the idea of "good not-fun" arose when I was trying to talk one of my friends into play <i>Gray Ranks</i> and he was explaining why he didn't want to.  IIRC correctly (the conversation was had over beer at a bar, so my memories are a little muddled) his reasons for not wanting to play that had nothing to do with thinking it just wouldn't be "fun" so I'm not sure if talking to him about this idea of the pleasure of story creation will help at all, but I might still have to talk to him about it, just for kicks.<br/><br/>IIRC, his reasons had more to do with thinking he wouldn't be able to do the subject matter "justice."  So... to bring it back to <i>Steal Away Jordan</i>... does anyone have any ideas for overcoming that kind of restance?  The "Oh man, that's a heavy topic!  I wouldn't want to make light of it or not treat it with respect!" kind of reaction?  Frankly, with the friend I just mentioned, I'm pretty sure there's also a big factor of him just not at ALL being interested in the genre of these kinds of games... but I probably have other friends that might not have a problem with that, but might be worried about the "respect" issue.  Which, frankly, back when the game first came out and there were people talking about people being "afraid" to play it, I tried to self-analyze a bit and I realized that I probably am myself... and mostly I think I am because I'm concerned other people would say/think "You're playing a GAME about slaves!?  That's horrible!" and basically think I'm demeaning the topic/history by partaking in a form of entertainment involving it.<br/><br/>Umm.  Yeah.

It's like, when I think of good movies, if they're good, even if I can't relate to the situation that the characters are in, I should be able to relate to them as people. They should have cares and wants and what not that are pretty much universal (or universally understandable).<br/><br/>For example, I recently read Beloved (to keep us on the topic of slavery), and what makes that book work for me is that I get, not the reality of what the characters went through (after all I've never been through slavery), but I get what it is these characters wanted from their lives, and so I understood why they behaved as they did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153470/#Comment_153470" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T20:59:35+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  8:59PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>He says that he doubts it really counts as a roleplaying game, because he can't imagine playing a story about slavery for fun</blockquote>Does that strike anyone else as a completely inane comment?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153472/#Comment_153472" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T21:14:58+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  9:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well as i commented earlier i never knew that part what defines something as an rpg is that it is "fun."
