Now, I haven't played it, so I could be way off base here. But anyway, I also just read the rules to InSpectres, which had the opposite effect of making me want to play right away (I was warped/shaped as a child by Ghostbusters), and I was struck that the potentially silly feel, mission oriented play, and franchise support of both games would mesh really well.<br/><br/>My only sticking point so far is that 'contacts' would probably see less use for Ninja than normal people, but other than that I think they'd be a great fit. Does anybody have any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.
