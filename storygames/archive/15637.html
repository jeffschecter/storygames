Our first day is today. Our first game MIGHT be Giger Counter (or 44, Inspectres, or Lacuna if they decide to switch).  <br/>\nThe Problem I'm seeing is I might have 9 players. The game book says plays best with 5-7 players.   Any advice or info on how this might run with more people?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354359/#Comment_354359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T13:37:57+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  1:37PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How long is the planned session?  I love Geiger Counter but I've sometimes had trouble completing the game with six players, even with a fair amount of pre-session pitch and prep.<br/><br/>You'll need to get rolling immediately.  Have a core concept pre-picked, i.e. "We are going to play a survival horror game about space marines investigating the Roanoke V outpost.  It's gone silent." <br/><br/>I recommend letting the players flesh out their characters but provide a list of twelve names and twelve archetypes that fit your concept for them to pick from, e.g. The Commander, The Recruit, The Perfect Soldier, The Valkyrie, The Deserter, The Prisoner, The Veteran, The Squirrel, The Empath, etc.<br/><br/>Maybe you mostly just facilitate the game yourself and/or play all the unnamed characters only?  Nine will be tough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354363/#Comment_354363" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T13:50:48+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  1:50PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you split into two tables?

In general, though, I've always found Geiger works best with 4-5 players, with people doubling up on characters rather than trying to play with a huge number of folks.  With a large number of characters, you need people to start dying almost immediately (some even taking the Dead condition long before they need to) if the game is going to have a prayer of ending in a single session, and that's harder to make happen if that's somebody's only character ("my guy" / cold dead fingers / etc.).<br/><br/>I have faith that Geiger (and Mist-Robed Gate, for that matter) can work with large numbers of people, but it's going to take new editions for that to be well supported.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Helix" title="Helix"><img alt="Helix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Helix">Helix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354779/#Comment_354779" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T19:25:15+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  7:25PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for the Advice. We ended up wth 6 playing and just went for it with all of us. Our film was titeld "It Came from the Hole" and centered around a research station build around &amp; experimenting with a black hole. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe actually didn't have too much of a problem beating the menace. Alot of the early rolls were bad for th emenace so there were alot of excapes and not many conditions put on the characters. I pushed a few character Vs Character conflicts to get some conditions going and spice things up before the menace got to 8 dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall it was alot of fun. Good story, laughs and some tension. Game actually lasted about 2.5 hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354801/#Comment_354801" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T01:15:44+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  1:15AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.
