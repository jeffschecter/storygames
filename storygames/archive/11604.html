My suggestion would be to talk about it as a group some night before you actually play; just sit down and hash out what everyone thinks is an appropriate way to handle these traits, maybe house-rule in some resource management scheme if that'd help keep everyone in line. Having this discussion outside the game is important, I think, because you don't want this to feel like a personal attack on anyone, and if you try to negotiate it in the middle of a scene there's really no other way it can be taken.</blockquote>\nThis is a common suggestion: that you talk problems out as a group. The issue we're talking about, by the way, is <i>exploiting</i> a rule: specifically, shoehorning freeform traits into every conflict.<br/><br/>Yet I can't actually imagine having a conversation like this. I'm not sure I'd want to. It sounds rather unpleasant. Certainly, I can't recall having had such a conversation.<br/><br/>Has anyone had a conversation like this? How did it go? If you have an issue like this (not rulebreaking, not blatantly antisocial, but something that bothers someone at the table), how would you handle it?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258663/#Comment_258663" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T06:40:50+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  6:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had this discussion, and I've called bullshit at the table.

When "Try a different way" is a regular and established part of play and is just something you do, this sort of awkward social dance becomes obsolete.

In that situation, I'd be like "You think it would be better if I leave him alive? Okay, I trust you guys."

The question is whether it would be <i>more</i> unpleasant than seething quietly to himself throughout the game about what's bothering him or bringing it up in the middle of a scene.  Sometimes there's no pleasant solution, and you just have to do the least-unpleasant thing you can, whatever that may be.<br/><br/>And I made the suggestion because bringing it up in the middle of a scene had already been shot down in the original post: no one was doing that, because it would've been a huge downer and would have made the guy they were interrupting feel bad.  So if you can't or won't do that, what can you do instead?<br/><br/><br/>The group I play in is pretty harmonious after so many years together, and also comfortable with "state of the game" discussions; considering that we typically start a new campaign by sitting down for a session and talking about it first, taking a pause here and there in the middle of a campaign to ask how things are going and whether we need to make some changes isn't a big deal.  If it identifies a problem and lets us work out a solution, it's time well spent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258857/#Comment_258857" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T18:04:07+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  6:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Certainly it's better to have the conversation preventatively than remedially.

What I didn't mention there was that, once the blow-up was past and we talked it out, Alex totally saw where I was coming from. If I'd tried some variation on "Try a Different Way" or even pulled him aside and said "dude, I really wish you wouldn't do that. You're upstaging the intended focus of this subplot," then it probably would never have come to such an ugly head. Of course, the lingering frustration from other stuff going on might not have come up, but it's possible that things would have just fixed themselves eventually anyway.

Maybe we're misunderstanding or need more context or the person needs help fleshing out what they are trying to say and why. Inquire but give the benefit of doubt, listen charitably, and offer suggestions. <br/><br/>Sometimes ideas are like babies. We don't know what they will fully look like till we give them a chance to grow. Feed the babies first :-)<br/><br/>And also pick your battles!

It's bothering me".<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nI've had that conversation, comfortably and uncomfortably. The way we've been doing it in our group recently is actually really cool, and I think it gets us closer to the place we want to be at as an RPG group. If a GM or players notice that a certain behavior is coming up in a game that's weird, somebody just initiates a brief chat about it before game or in emails in downtime.<br/><br/>For example, in my Farscape game (I'm running it with SOTC) I've noticed that people aren't really taking advantage of their aspects, and this sometimes causes rules confusion. I've also had some players tell me that they don't feel like Aspects do what they want them to, like people are unhappy with it and how people aren't using them consistently. So I've written up to start my game this weekend with a run-down of the rules, a q&amp;a in case people are confused, and specific examples of how aspects could be used and then the opportunity to change any aspects that people aren't happy with. Simple.<br/><br/>Another thing we periodically do as GM's is send out emails saying "hey, do you still like my game, what else would you like to do with your character, what plots would you like to see, what special weapon would you like bestowed upon you" stuff that's kinda meta that you can't ask during the game. Its a way to keep the game focused on what everybody wants.<br/><br/>Sometimes people will, over dinner break or down time, joke about things people do that bug them a little, and that lets off a bit of steam, is non-confrontational, and helps us all play together better in our prospective styles by learning what everyone prefers. We have the emo roleplayer, the indie (me!), the politics person, the systems person, the immersionist... y'know, every group has different dynamics. <br/><br/>Its all about communication. I think the more you have those conversations, the smoother the game will run, and people will have more fun doing it cause they all get input. I guess this isn't 100% what you're saying, Graham, but it deals with techniques you could apply to what you're saying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258966/#Comment_258966" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T14:25:33+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  2:25PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>There's a dude I play with who always wants to kick ass, and puts a lot of thought into optimizing effectivness.<br/><br/>Before playing a low-powered, low-strategy game with him, the GM sat him down and said, "This game doesn't support that thing you do.
