                    To procrastinate from doing a design sketch, I'm playing RPG meme.
<ol><li><p>What is your game about?</p><p>One year ago, his wife said to Ichigo no Kiriyama, "It is hot. Bring me snow from Korea to cool my brow." Ichigo went to Korea and brought back Snow, its princess. In the ensuing months, he became Kiriyama Daimyo, and the winter came, and with it the snow. Now he and his retainers are trapped in the walls of Kyuuden Sougiri, and they can all see something none want - Snow is beautiful, more beautiful than the rain.</p><p>This is the question of Snow From Korea - can the samurai stand against the temptations of the princess, who will otherwise bring down the court?</p></li><li><p><em>What do the characters do?</em></p><p>They are the samurai. They fight and maneuver in court; they love and they die, and all the while, they struggle with the competing desires of the court's survival and the overwhelming, suffocating allure of Snow.</p></li><li><p><em>What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?</em></p><p>The players collaborate to generate resources; these resources control the power of Snow and determine who has the power to set new scenes, while they struggle to avoid emotional breakdowns in their relationships.</p></li><li><p><em>How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</em></p><p>The characters are trapped in Kyuuden Sougiri, the daimyo's winter palace. This is their world, for the time being; there is no safe alternative to the struggle inside it. (That is to say, the setting makes it impossible for the character's actions to be irrelevant to the game's goal.)</p></li><li><p><em>How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?</em></p><p>This is a Color thing - characters are created first by writing a haiku. This sets them firmly in romanticised-Japan mode. Mechanically, it is more significant that they are defined in terms of their relationships with other characters, their wives, Snow, and Ichigo, and how severely these relations are stressed.</p></li><li><p><em>What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?</em></p><p>Certain narrated actions, and certain types of Color, are rewarded. BLAH BLAH DESIGN PATTER</p></li><li><p><em>How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?</em></p><p>Play-Shreyas-wants is mechanically rewarded with cards, which allow you to make decisions about things. No cards, no meaningful input.</p></li><li><p><em>How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?</em></p><p>Phrlar. The essential non-player characters are communal tools, while each player commands his samurai and advises the samurai's wife, whose actions are mechanistically controlled. Other incidental details are given to the player who has set the current scene. (In theory you could have a female samurai and a male "wife", though this will have extremely visible repercussions.)</p></li><li><p><em>What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation?</em></p><p>Resource games!</p></li><li><p><em>What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?</em></p><p>It's two interwoven rummy-like card games. One card game governs the outcome of the scene at hand, while the other one provides the privilege to set the next scene.</p></li><li><p><em>How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?</em></p><p>The scene resolution mechanic only discusses things that the game cares about; it's not reinforcement, but constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?</em></p><p>Dunno. Probably not. Don't see a point in it.</p></li><li><p><em>How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</em></p><p>I'm not sure that absence of an irrelevant, though traditional, element is really particularly germane to the game's Zen.</p></li><li><p><em>What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?</em></p><p>I want the players to feel like the characters, all of them, are pawns in a delicate game, and to feel like it is a game they cannot win alone. They must all band together to dig the court out from Snow's influence, but what will this cost them?</p></li><li><p><em>What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?</em></p><p>Loyalty. Love. Seduction. The color of the seasons.</p></li><li><p><em>Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in?</em></p><p>I'm really intrigued by the potentials of constrained scene-setting mechnics. And card games.</p></li><li><p><em>Where does your game take the players that other games canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, or wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t?</em></p><p>Bleh. You could do this with some other game, probably. The point here is that this game disallows you from doin' other stuff. Its situation cannot be escaped.</p></li><li><p><em>What are your publishing goals for your game?</em></p><p>Write it, play it, maybe release it in print as part of a compilation of 'Shreyas gets wuxia out of his system' games.</p></li><li><p><em>Who is your target audience?</em></p><p>Me.</p></li></ol> </div>

<p>Not about the game, but yes - I often felt, and you can see that in my responses, that the questions were asking about games with a much weaker kind of focus than the one I was designing for, and so they don't really tell me anything as I am answering them.</p>
<p>It was an interesting and difficult problem to make Snow's ability actually feel <em>suffocating.</em></p>
