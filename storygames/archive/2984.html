Is it unethical that I'm blowing off my ethics exam?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>What's that fourth creative agenda somebody mentioned offhand?</blockquote>\nThe hell if I know!  I'm taking a wild stab at it.  Apparently in some Forge thread, Ron said that "Zilchplay" is its own agenda.  I haven't read this thread, and the Forge keeps giving me error messages when I try to search.  So I can't provide much enlightenment here on why he said that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Provisional Forge Glossary</cite><br/>ZILCHPLAY - Desiring characters to be active particpants in an imagined world, but also to do as little as possible to make that shared imagining happen. A type of Simulationism by default, because in the absence of a desire to actively pursue a Gamist or Narrativist agenda the only focus is on exploration. A controversial term, coined by Walt Freitag; see Zilchplay (split from Understanding: the "it").</blockquote>\nKeeping in mind that (a) I wasn't around when the term was coined, and (b) the Forge is presently unsearchable, I unpack this to mean a way of playing that really isn't about any particular reward. When you're doing zilchplay, you're basically noodling around without really thinking too hard about what you're doing, and not going too far out of your way to make the game itself fun or exciting for others.  <br/><br/>As an example: once upon a time, I ran this on-line campaign where everyone wanted to fight this evil villain.  He was hard to beat, and also interesting thematically.  But there was this while in the campaign where we all kinda slipped into this mode where, "Whadda you wanna do?"  "I dunno, whadda you wanna do?".  And we killed <i>sessions</i> like this.  Dude wandered around and resolved a character sub-plot that (for me as a GM at least) wasn't very interesting.  Some other guy put together a political alliance.  But there was no in-game pressure or out-of-game excitement, at least on my part.  I was, at that point, sort of running the game simply to run it.  My reward--after a couple of months of this--had nothing to do with the stuff going on in the game, or even the activity of <i>gaming per se</i>.  Looking back on it, I basically wanted to chill out for a few hours with my friends, jibber-jabber in a low-key way about science-fiction characters, and then get on with the rest of my day.<br/><br/>And that's viable if that's what you wanna do.  There's nothing wrong with it, as long as it's not pissing other people off.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Ron figured it was part of Sim sometime during 2004.  Maybe he's changed his mind.  Like I said, I don't have access to the original thread, nor to the thread where it apparently got promoted.  But that's my understanding of what the term means (and I could be totally wrong.)<br/><br/>If other people were there, and really know this stuff, please step in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68044/#Comment_68044" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T13:59:36+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  1:59PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kynn --<br/><br/>It's difficult to talk about Simulationism "these days" because the GNS structure has been largely given up in favor of the much more general Creative Agenda structure, with Gamism, Narrativism, and Simulationism as core classifications of Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>I'm happy to talk about Simulationism, but I need to be able to do so in a context where you understand that there may be contradictions, and those are part of the reason why the GNS structure isn't used a lot as a theory tool anymore.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68064/#Comment_68064" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:19:31+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:19PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 2:19PM by Matt Snyder.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>What is a good explanation for what Sim means these days, and why would someone say there are four and not three creative agendas?</blockquote>\nI am completely unaware that Zilchplay (or anything else) was recognized as a Creative Agenda. To my knowledge, Gamism, Narrativism and Simulationism were it.<br/><br/>Simulationism was a matter of great debate for years. Frankly, I think many people who have discussed it then and now still disagree about the term. For one, Simulationism isn't so much about Simulating a thing "realistically." Another way to describe it that caught on was "internally consistent." I.e. Space Physics in Star Wars aren't realistic, but are consistent in Star Wars "universe."<br/><br/>My understanding of the term, confirmed with Ron in personal conversations, is that Simulationism is about <i>celebrating</i> and/or riffing on <i>something</i>. This celebratory exploration is the highest reward for a functional Simulationist group of players, the thing they find most rewarding as the game works through its reward cycles (rewards are many, but include things like XP awards, bonuses granted on the fly, etc.) This is what I understand The Right To Dream is about. <br/><br/>So, if your group's all about the realism of a thing, then that's the thing you're celebrating. If it's the Star Trek Universe, then it's that. If it's post-apocalyptic hot rods, it's that. Frequently, but not always, it is a pre-existing thing. Say, Star Wars or steampunk stuff. But, sometimes it's also exploring some new thing -- like some kind of mashup setting that people get really jazzed about. It need not be a setting. It could be something else the group wants to celebrate, like a bad ass biker, or John Woo gun play, or whatever.<br/><br/>I like this approach to Simulationism (that is, as I've described it here) and support it, because it recognizes Simulationism as it's own functional thing. It's not an absence of Gamism or Narrativism. It is it's <i>own</i> agenda. Many people rankled prior to that; they felt the theory insulted them as enjoy the lack of a thing. With this understanding of Simulationism, they could positively point to their thing and say "Yep, this is why I do this, and I'm cool with that and so is everyone else."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68068/#Comment_68068" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:25:53+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:25PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys.

Vanilla had few -- many things one did as a group system-wise to accomplish whatever it was they were after. Pervy, contrariwise, was about high points of contact -- even arcane manipulation of mechanics to achieve a thing.<br/><br/>It wasn't exclusively about one Creative Agenda, really, though much discussion of these terms hinged on Narrativism (i.e. Vanilla Narrativism). Specifically, I recall some speculation that "gamers" were typically more into Pervy stuff, while people new to the hobby tended to respond much better to Vanilla. <br/><br/>I would point to two Narrativism examples. These "happen" to be Narrativism, but I think it's perfectly acceptable to use these terms in other modes. <br/><br/>So, Prime Time Adventures is my go-to Vanilla Narrativism example. I think Troll Babe would fit that bill, too.<br/><br/>I'd use my own Nine Worlds as some pretty pervy Narrativism stuff. There are many points of contact there, as compared to Prime Time Adventures in particular. <br/><br/>Hopefully, that answer your question, Jason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68086/#Comment_68086" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:49:06+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:49PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Matt and Secret Whisperer!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68089/#Comment_68089" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:54:22+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:54PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey folks: in answering these questions, it might be a good idea to add some Actual Play examples from your own experience, if you know of any.

Pervy is just the opposite, more points of contact.  It's hard to say a system is Pervy or Vanilla without some reference point.  It's like saying I'm a "big" person.  Big compared to whom or what?  <br/><br/>However, you can make some generalizations that tend to hold true when judging where games have a relatively high number of points of contact or a low number.  For example, Systems with lots of different specialized mechanics for different actions tend to be more Pervy than systems with a single mechanic that handles everything.  Thus, D&amp;D is more Pervy than say, Sorcerer or TSoY.  (Forget Creative Agendas for the moment.)<br/><br/>Also, games can be Pervy with respect to one facet of play and Vanilla in others.  For example, Sorcerer is fairly Pervy in terms of dealing with Demons (Summoning, Binding, Punishing, etc) but Vanilla as can be when dealing with who has narration rights.  But that's because Demons are pretty darn central to the game while who gets to narrate after a roll isn't.<br/><br/>Anyway, I probably muddied the waters even more than they were before.  If so, I'm sorry Jason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68200/#Comment_68200" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T03:55:24+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  3:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to derail the thread, but it was my understanding that the idea of Zilchplay fell out of fashion towards the end of the theory-forum days.

We might imagine it to be: "A good way to look at it is that a Vanilla system may or may not be simple ("light"), but if the system is simple (i.e. not complex), it's probably Vanilla.<br/><br/>Some examples ... <br/><br/>In Prime Time Adventures, anyone can award fanmail for whatever reason they wish. There aren't any real ajudications or steps. You just do it. Neat. <br/><br/>But, there is an actual rules set about this. It's not "rules lite" as code for "Well, let the GM decide whatever he/she wants" or "Just do what you, the group, think is most fun." Instead, there are specific fanmail rules, and an economy for how they work, and a simple indication of how you award fanmail according to the rules. Thus, vannila as distinguished from "rules lite."<br/><br/>In Nine Worlds, there are lots of pretty Pervy things going on. Here again, there are strict rules. But, they're applied in myriad ways in any given Phase (scene), with many possible points of contact. You can win Points. You can use Points to increase your Muses, create new Muses on the fly, or enact your Urges, and those rules are meant to be followed strictly. How you spend those points is dictated by the timing of your Fate values, and so on. All to decide what happens in a scene, and how the points influence what you're going to say AND what others are going to say in narration.<br/><br/>However, I do not agree that Nine Worlds is a "crunchy" game, or even a particularly "rules heavy" game. It's not really complex. It's just not. There aren't any "add ons" like feats and such (i.e. Crunch). The rules, once mastered, are all there is. There is no extention or expansion. They cover all possible conflicts and rewards in the game. Thus, it's "Pervy" but not "Rules Heavy." <br/><br/>The difference between the two is the emphasis the group places on Exploring the System. That's Forge talk for making things happen "in the game" (in the fiction, etc.) by using the system a lot (Pervy) or not a lot (Vanilla).<br/><br/>So, when you play, do you do a lot of things with the rules and/or mechanical bits to make stuff happen? Or, do you do relatively few things with the rules and/or mechanical bits to make imaginative stuff happen? The former is Pervy. The latter is vanilla.<br/><br/>And, when we look at that, we don't really know whether the game is "rules heavy" or "rules lite" as we gamers generally have used those terms. Basically, the Forge discussion, started by Ron, found "rules heavy" and "rules lite" terms that everyone used and nobody actually agreed about what the heck they meant.<br/><br/>I think it was a valid distinction, but one that ultimately fizzled. I do think several Forgers internalized this distinction, and I can't recall "rules heavy" or "rules light" getting used much by people I talk game stuff with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68266/#Comment_68266" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T09:57:49+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  9:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Troy: Lasersharking isn't a thing that's necessarily done in play.

It is, in terms of game design, rather boring since the <em>game design itself</em> (and not the resulting fiction) doesn't really do much.  The fiction might rock out, but the game design was kind of pale and sad and colorless.<br/><br/>By contrast, a "Pervy Narr" game has tons of points of contact, and the mechanics and procedures are constantly shoving their nose into the fiction to get things to go in novel, unique, and "pervy" directions ("pervy" is derived from <em>perverse</em>, which means <em>bent</em> -- "pervy" tries to bend the fiction into new shapes).<br/><br/>There is a boatload of implied disdain for both terms, but I think it's informative disdain.  Those who prefer pervy games find vanilla games boring; those who prefer vanilla games find pervy games more convoluted than necessary and hence uncomfortable.  And back in the heydey of trying out new stuff, when players first tried out pervy games, they probably felt a certain thrill in doing things in new and interesting ways -- as opposed to Missionary all the damn time, neh?<br/><br/>(P.S. Poor Vanilla get such a bad rap as being a lack of flavor, when it is, in fact, a very vibrant flavor that is hella tasty.

(Can you point to a system, or an actual play example, which is one but not the other?) </blockquote>\nNo.  A freeform system with no written rules or dice or anything can (and likely will) have a high number of Points of Contact.  I wish I could search for the post where someone pointed this out but I can't at the moment.  The issue here is that in a freeform game where group consensus must be reached to add something to the fiction then every single thing you want to add actually has to go through the System of getting everyone's approval before adding stuff.  That's high points of contact.  In a freeform game where anyone can add anything to the fiction without any approval from others, well, that's low points of contact.  After all, you just say the thing and it enters the fiction.  Neither of these cases are 'crunchy'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68293/#Comment_68293" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T11:35:18+00:00" title="May 10, 2007 11:35AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to mention that this thread is extra-large deep-dish awesome with double heavy metal sauce.

The reason those terms are used is precisely beacuse each side tends to find the other "odd" for the same reasons as one would apply the terms in question to sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that Vanilla is sex jargon...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I can add, that may elucidate that Pervy does not mean "Crunchy" is that freeform games are amongs the highest in Points of Contact. Or so the argument goes. That's because there's no simple rules that tell you what happens... you have to refer to the system - the GM making arbitrary rulings in most cases - to determine what happens. This is an incredibly simple system - ask the GM. But it's high in POC because you have to refer to the system often to get a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a counter-argument for the example, but it's not important if freeform is Pervy or Vanilla (that could be it's own debate). The point is that some games refer you back to the rules constantly to figure out what's going on. Others just say, "Narrate what you want until X comes along" where X is relatively rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I prefer pervy games. I don't like lots of play to go by without some reference to the system to find out where play should go next. I feel there should be many hooks by which the system demands you to use it. Or a high number of points of contact, in other words.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZilchplay - there is a good case for this if only in that in many cases the "real" agenda may be so low-key as to be indeterminate. Put it this way, if you can't tell what the agenda is, it's zilchplay as a description of that fact. What's agreed, generally, is that this is a real phenomenon, play where you can't tell what the agenda is. Even if it's somehow theoretically "gamism" on some unseen level. Basically, as a practical thing, the impetus of play when in zilchplay is low enough that you can't accomodate for it in any particular way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's "sim" in that sim is defined as not putting anything else before exploration. As exploration has to happen for there to be play happening, a game where you can't discern one of the other two agendas could be called sim from that perspective. But that's not very useful. Even if it is sim, somehow, that still doesn't tell you how to address the goals of play and such.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimulationism... I am partly to blame about the confusion about this, what with my various attempts to describe sim from other POVs than the standard one. To be clear, Ron and I at least agree on what sim is. All of my alternate models have merely described the same phenomenon in different manners. But the impetus I've had to do this is because I feel that there's so much confusion over just what simulationism is. Though I may well have made things less understandable for more people than I've helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm a tad gunshy about the topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorse, there seems to be a lot of indentity politics wrapped up in the whole discussion of sim. Again, perhaps, starting with myself. I was one of the strongest reactionaries to The Beeg Horseshoe, Jared Sorensen's attempt to describe sim as a retreat from gamism or narrativism. I stand by that objection, still, but in later days have become more sympathetic to what I see as an important fact that underlies the relationship between the modes. Hence my "Beeg Horseshoe II."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe identity politics start, however, with the claim that sim is somehow different than the other two modes. Without trying to be provocative, our side sees people worried that sim is being somehow devalued by it's being described as a minority. This feeling, should anyone have it, is probably reinforced by the fact that, even if concilliatory towards sim, it's not indicated as the preferred mode of most of us theory pundits. So the feeling we get is that the feeling the other side gets is that we're not giving sim it's due.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm quite sure that we either sound like:<br/>\n"Yeah, yeah, sim is an equal mode, sure."<br/>\nOr like I probably have at times:<br/>\n"Sim is the most important mode, because it sticks to the basis of what makes RPGs unique!"<br/>\n(They think that I'm trying to soothe them)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's one of those things like race discussions where you're going to come off as disingenuous even when you're being honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the other side wants to redefine it to mean something... more equal. It's not "just" exploration, it's... "discovery!" To use the MJ Young model (IIRC?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with these is that they tend to all seem to focus on one particular aspect of sim such that they leave large portions of play undescribed. For a select few entrenched individuals, sim is often defined as "How I play? That's sim."<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this is from my highly biased POV. From their POV, I think we look like we're defending a gross accumulation of leftover playstyles - everything not gamism or narrativism - as the style in which they prefer to play (or at least are arguing for). We don't "get" what it's really about, and so our definition doesn't really indicate anything about the style of play that they want to define.<br/>\n<br/>\nI come down on the side I come down upon because I feel that the defining line for the modes - why they're mutually exclusive - is in terms of when you can point to a shift in style due to reward systems. Between the various forms of sim, there are few real problems in terms of reward. They all fit together generally. You don't get "incoherent play" at the gross agenda level between these forms. So it seems to me that any breakdown further is to create sub-modes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a lot of people don't keep in mind is that the three Creative Agendas are essentially categories of play across a specific axis. There are other axes that make up the Creative Agenda, other ways to categorize play within it. But GNS specifically is diagnostic for the problems of "incoherency" across methods of decision-making and reward amongst players. To say nothing of sub-categories of the three GNS agendas. These all exist, and all can cause problems. The GNS breakdown only speaks to the broadest categories where we can identify potential trouble between players - incoherency.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut more simply, since these are mutually exclusive, this is where players will tend to get alienated in play, if they are expecting a CA other than what the rest of the group are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the only use for GNS categories, but it's definitive of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, you might be quick to point out that this leaves tons of room open for other methods of categorization, etc, that fit the overall model. And you'd be right. You might also point out that GNS therefore really only impacts a fraction of play, and you'd be right again. You might even say that GNS wasn't all that important.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you'd be agreeing with Ron at last.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "Big Model" says that Creative Agendas are whatever they are... that the important part is that they tend to vary, and that can cause problems. This, overall, is much more important to understand than what the particular modes of play may be, or whether or not they are mutually exclusive, or anything else about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone really wants to hear me rant on about how sim varies from gam and nar, that's going to have to be a whole 'nother thread, where I'll be tempted to point people back at the three times I've made cogent attempts at trying to explain it previously.

In one of them, some people came up with the term "constructive denial." What they meant is that Sim involves not just figuring out what can go into the fiction (and how) but a whole lot of people insisting what cannot go into the fiction (and how). This ties into the "Right to Dream" in that people are using this <i>right</i> to deny stuff because they don't feel it's <i>right</i>. It upsets the Dream, so cross it out. <br><br>The "stuff" that people deny includes fictional elements of all kinds -- basically system, setting, character, situation, and color. The "realism" thing is generally denial of setting (because the player feels the element does not fit "realistically" into the setting) or denial of system (because the player feels the system does not adequately provide a vehicle for "realistic" play). Realism here really means credibility -- something credible doesn't upset the Dream.<br><br>A game can be said to support Simulationism if it provides player tools for constructive denial. Sim games approach this in different ways. GURPS, for example, seems to provide a variety of optional rules that players can use, or not, as they like in order to create the players' Dream. A game like Universalis offers strong rules for determining exactly what the elements of the game are going to be, or not be, through its token system; that is, you have currency for purchasing constructive denial abilities, more or less. Someone with more Universalis experience can stomp on me if I have that wrong.<br><br><b>Zilchplay</b><br><br>As I understand it, Zilchplay is the absence of a Creative Agenda. I've never seen the interpretation that it's "low level" G, N, or S but I haven't been paying enough attention to Zilchplay topics. I think I do remember Ron saying that he finally had to admit the existence of Zilchplay in some AP report. I don't think it was touted as a fourth Creative Agenda.<br><br><b>Pervy / Vanilla</b><br><br>I don't think these terms are really in vogue any more. I see "Vanilla Narr" occasionally (for example, Ron's AP reports about the Vanilla Narr D&amp;D game that he ran).

It's not a creative agenda in the sense that it's not an active approach to how/what people want to create, but instead focuses on other agenda levels (social, technical, etc.) I don't feel strongly about Zilchplay either way, but I always wonder why, in the arguments with anti-theory people, no one mentions Zilchplay as a counterexample to the claim "the so-called `theory' never changes".</p>\n<p>My big complaint about the creative agendas was that they are based on intentions and desires of players, which is something you can never really know, only guess at. Contrast that to technical agendas, like "I like pervy games that use dice, but with low handling time". Once everyone agrees what "pervy" and "handling time" means, it's a bit easier to test for which games fit that agenda.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Points of contact haven't been adequately explained in this thread, especially how they differ from the term crunchy in general rpg speak. I'm going to take a crack at it and see if I'm right.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrunchy is typically used to refer to the denseness of rules. For example, Rolemaster is incredibly crunchy. Dungeons and Dragons  and Burning Wheel are crunchy. Dogs in the Vineyard is not very crunchy. Lacuna is not crunchy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoints of contact refer to the process of resolving something when we go to the rules. Note I am speaking of the rules and not system. Points of contact are made in reference to game rules. A game where we do lots of stuff before we resolve whatever we use the rules for has high points of contact. A game where we do very little before we resolve what we're doing has low points of contact. For example both Burning Wheel and Dogs in the Vineyard tend to have high points of contact. Burning Wheel has scripting, you chose stuff, and keep track of points, and then you get a resolution. Dogs while not as crunchy as Burning Wheel also has high points of contact. It has the whole escalation process where we roll a bunch of dice, we take turns saying stuff, and we can bring more dice in, and then more dice, and then we have a resolution. Heroquest or Lacuna have low points of contact. Heroquest you roll a d20, and then you're done. Lacuna you roll a couple of d6's, and then you're done.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames can differ I think in their points of contact. Heroquest has low points of contact normally, but it seems like it has high points of contact when you do a Heroquest. (I'm basing this off some assumptions based off Mike's running of the game, I haven't read Heroquest)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

It's not like we have to be jumping up on the table screaming, "Oh my god, that was so cool!" in order to be communicating our approval or disapproval of other players' contributions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68485/#Comment_68485" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T10:57:32+00:00" title="May 11, 2007 10:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br>It's difficult to talk about Simulationism "these days" because the GNS structure has been largely given up in favor of the much more general Creative Agenda structure, with Gamism, Narrativism, and Simulationism as core classifications of Creative Agenda.<br><br>I'm happy to talk about Simulationism, but I need to be able to do so in a context where you understand that there may be contradictions, and those are part of the reason why the GNS structure isn't used a lot as a theory tool anymore.<br/></br></br></br></blockquote>\nBen, I thank you for the reply, but I don't understand anything you said in it, except for the sense that definitions of Simulationism may be obsolete.<br><br>You lost me when you said that the GNS structure has been given up for the Creative Agenda structure, in which the creative agendas classifications are ...

In one of them, some people came up with the term "constructive denial." What they meant is that Sim involves not just figuring out what can go into the fiction (and how) but a whole lot of people insisting what cannot go into the fiction (and how). This ties into the "Right to Dream" in that people are using this<i>right</i>to deny stuff because they don't feel it's<i>right</i>. It upsets the Dream, so cross it out.<br><br>The "stuff" that people deny includes fictional elements of all kinds -- basically system, setting, character, situation, and color. The "realism" thing is generally denial of setting (because the player feels the element does not fit "realistically" into the setting) or denial of system (because the player feels the system does not adequately provide a vehicle for "realistic" play). Realism here really means credibility -- something credible doesn't upset the Dream.<br><br>A game can be said to support Simulationism if it provides player tools for constructive denial. Sim games approach this in different ways. GURPS, for example, seems to provide a variety of optional rules that players can use, or not, as they like in order to create the players' Dream. A game like Universalis offers strong rules for determining exactly what the elements of the game are going to be, or not be, through its token system; that is, you have currency for purchasing constructive denial abilities, more or less. Someone with more Universalis experience can stomp on me if I have that wrong.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI've read this over, but I don't understand what the term "constructive denial" is meant to represent. Can you please explain this in simple language as a definition?<br><br>Is "right to dream" a piece of jargon, too? What does it mean?

What is "the right to dream"?<br/><br/>2. What is a definition of "constructive denial"?<br/><br/>3. What is the difference between GNS and Creative Agendas? Why does the latter use the former's terminology?</blockquote>\nNOT A GURU.<br/><br/>1. "The Right To Dream" is the original "catchphrase" that Ron Edwards used to describe the motivating impulse of GNS-Sim in his Sim essay. It is analogous to "Story Now" and "Step On Up" as a headline phrase that Ron felt captured something essential about the creative agenda. Don't let it confuse you if it doesn't speak to you.<br/><br/>2. Constructive Denial is deciding what "isn't right" or "doesn't fit" in the fiction of your game. Constructive in that you're pruning stuff away in order to protect and reinforce the good stuff - the stuff you're celebrating and playing with. Denial in that what you're doing is less a "making stuff up" process and more a "fitting in" process. You've got this huge bucket of "stuff" that <i>could</i> be part of your game - Constructive Denial is how you choose which bits actually get used.<br/><br/>3. GNS are the three generally recognized Creative Agendas that fit into the "Big Model". There might be more. They might have meaningful subflavors. Who cares? The important thing is that they describe meaningful "ways of having fun together" (reward) with respect to the <i>imagined content</i> of your game. There are other kinds of agendas - Social (having to do with the social relationships between people) and Technical (having to do with the specific kinds of procedures used) have been talked about, but aren't as well-explored.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68616/#Comment_68616" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T17:51:21+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  5:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Mark.<br/><br/>Can you give me one example of constructive denial?

"Creative Denial" is a description of (one form of) a process that is part of all exploration. It is not synonymous with the Simulationist Creative Agenda. It's just that this particular interaction is so crucial to the success of Simulationist play that it made sense to a lot of people to see S through that lens.<br/><br/>Think about it as part of a set with Passive Acceptance, Creative Acceptance, Denial, Acceptance, and Passive Denial. Then look at the phrases each one is associated with:<br/><br/>Creative Denial: "No, not that way, <i>this</i> way."<br/>Passive Denial: "I don't care."<br/>Denial: "No. That's not it."<br/>Creative Acceptance: "Yes. And it's purple and has wings!"<br/>Passive Acceptance: "I don't have a problem with that."<br/>Acceptance: "Cool.

GNS is just one attempt at defining what those wants often are - a somewhat rigorous attempt, mind you, by some players and designers who've observed (and participated in) a lot of play, but still just one possible breakdown.<br/><br/>As Mike Holmes said upstream in this thread, a lot of what shaped the particular breakdown of G, N, and S was the attempt to break CAs down <i>in terms of which CAs are incompatible with one another at the table</i> - so in that sense, GNS is a fairly "pure" expression of what Creative Agenda is supposed to mean. But even so, the particular way in which GNS breaks CAs down is less important to the Big Model as a whole than just... understanding that people want different stuff out of their games, and sometimes that leads to problems at the table. So it's not so much that GNS is outdated, as that it isn't the main point, and people were making it more important than the main point, so many habitual Big Model explainers started to de-emphasize it a bit.<br/><br/>(Me, I just think of GNS as a set of useful design targets. You know those wheeled rectangular bags that you see everyone with in airports? Those were originally designed for flight attendants: people who fly all the time and have a very specific set of needs. However, once those bags got out into the wild, lots of people wanted them, not just flight attendants. Similarly, a game designed with Narrativist principles in mind is going to appeal to a lot of people who probably don't hew exactly to a Narrativist CA - if there even is anyone who hews to it exactly.)<br/><br/>That's my impression, anyway. I hope this is helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68856/#Comment_68856" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T07:04:09+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  7:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's not turn this into a discussion of the merits of the theory.

As such, it isn't an "agenda" at all.  If it DOES have something to do with those interactions, then it can be analyzed by those conventions.  For example: "I don't like fantasy RPG's because magic rules never seem to feel 'magical' to me."  This would be a complaint that the magic rules that the player has encountered don't serve his (likely Sim) Creative Agenda.  "I don't like fantasy RPG's because of the implied racism of elves, orcs, dwarves, etc." has nothing to do with game interactions and everything to do with fantasy as such, so it's not really a preference that falls under the theory.<br/><br/>"Sue prefers a strong sense of shared authorship and therefore avoids traditional GM-heavy games" is a technical agenda ("I want the rules to support my contributions to authorship").  It could also be a social agenda, if worded slightly differently: "Sue prefers a strong sense of shared authorship and therefore avoids game groups with a heavy-handed GM"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68946/#Comment_68946" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:37:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:37AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was unaware of the term Technical Agenda, but it stands to reason that such would exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I made an argument (badly) not long ago that boils down to technical agenda provided by the players being more informative of the rest of play (including the Creative Agenda) than the techniques that are embedded in the rules of a particular RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I could argue that in my game of Hero Quest, what's promoting the narrativism agenda are the array of techniques I use to fill in the spaces between that are covered by the rules in the HQ book.

Awesomesauce. ROFLcopter!!!!!eleventyone!!!<br><br>ObThread:<br/><br/>So, is the general consensus that we should come up with new terms to replace the old terms? That we understand that the old terms just sorta got adapted informally from discussions and that's what stuck. But that we can come up with terms that are very counter-intuitive. And we can and should create intuitive jargon whose real-world meanings fit closer to our jargony meanings. Right?<br/><br/>Are we basically agreeing on the value of specialized jargon but disagreeing on the specific terms we selected to represent those ideas?<br/><br/>If so, what is the process of replacing a term with another? We've seen how poorly deprecation works in the "points of contact" vs. "vanilla/pervy" discussion earlier. I would think we'd pretty much want to "expunge the record" of old terms but, at the same time, a search-and-replace on web forums is neither easy nor desirable. How do you avoid the problem where someone asks for a reference, and you send them to a thread, but that threads uses all the old terms. Do you tell them, "Just mentally replace 'the impossible thing before breakfast' with 'authority paradox'"? If so, by the time they're done, they have to know twice as many jargon terms, and an extra relationship. Is this better?<br/><br/>By and large, I am curious if people have the same answers to those questions, which are -- to me -- pretty close to rhetorical. I think we're pretty much stuck with the jargon we inherited if we want to continue to have a common language. <br/><br/>A brave person does have the option to break off completely and create their own theory model. It could be The Big Model with new terms and no new ideas. That person could engage people in theory discussion using only his own terms and never really refer back to other text that references the old terms. (I'm not saying not to credit the giants whose shoulders we stand on.)<br/><br/>Me? I'm gonna keep using the crazy moon language. We might all belong to a generation of game designers who later designers consider quaint or odd with our strange terms. New folks will replace us, forget where they came from, and improve what we've done. Some of them may long for the days when the jargon wasnt so sterile and straightforward but, rather, evoked a sort of magical feel with its impossible things before breakfast, it's El Dorado, its Gnarliburrs and Herbies, illusionism and ouija board role-playing. But if more people understand the theory, I'll be happy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69189/#Comment_69189" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T08:39:00+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  8:39AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>... its Gnarliburrs and Herbies, ...</blockquote>\nWait...

So you can't avoid jargon and have efficient discussions.  But with proper nomenclature, you can create terms that are fairly original (such as by combining two terms in an atypical manner) to help prevent misunderstandings, yet still provide a good idea to the initiated as to what they mean.

If you use common english like Authority Paradox, somebody will come along and say that they have seen that term used in another context, and were confused by it's inclusion in the discussion at hand. Narrativism has had this charge leveled at it, in fact, because it does have another (pretty obscure) use.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, you make the term unique, then it's indecipherable from it's name, and perhaps less memorable for that. That's not to say that it's impossible to find some nice middle ground. But by the time you do that, the term is often getting so long that you're starting to put the definition as the title of the term. When the whole idea of having a term is to make shorthand for some phenomenon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Impossible Thing Before Breakfast, for instance, has a "real world" (odd way to put it, but...) meaning, yes. So there is the problem that it will get confounded by a person's understanding of the term that way. But, in fact, it was chosen because it means something like willing disbelief. That is, to be precise TITBB refers to texts which propose that there is no paradox, and that the GM and players can somehow have authority over the same things at the same time. A willing disbelief that there's a potential problem here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it's still a tad odd from that perspective (it's actually probably more like ignorance of the problem at all in most cases). But taken as a phenomenon, it does seem to Ron at least that there's some sort of intention across RPGs to ignore a real problem. Hence his selection of the term. This is important to it's understanding. Marco Chacon (frequent poster) will say that TITBB doesn't exist because the texts in question either don't mean what Ron says they mean, or that they're easily maneuvered from in order to play without problem. Ron's counter is that this may be so, but the impression that the texts give have in his and other's experiences, caused the outcome problem that you might expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamely in this case GMs who think that they're creating plot and sharing it at the same time. Or, rather, players who feel disempowered because the GM isn't really allowing them to control the plot in any meaningful way, just providing an illusion of control at best. In other words, It enables railroaders, at the very least, and in worse cases creates them. And mostly because those writing the texts are either confused about the issue, or immitating those before and unaware of the issue. So this willingness to swallow the "party line" on this subject without critical thinking is, in fact, exactly the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr so the argument goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69632/#Comment_69632" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T09:24:00+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  9:24AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really see a problem with Gnarliburr. We do this kind of thing all the time in English, naming terms after people in stories. It's an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eponym" rel="nofollow">eponym</a>. Outside of gaming, we have our Don Quixotes, Mary Sues, and Napoleans. Basically, it's human nature to remember people from stories and draw analogies to them.<br><br>It's a problem when the name is used without the story. I think the Forge Glossary "Gnarliburr" entry should tell the story.
