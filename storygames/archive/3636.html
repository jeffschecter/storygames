The greater NYC area appears to be a hive of scum and gamery, and I'm loving it.<br/><br/>Last night John S ("jenskot") GM'ed Dogs for Me, Jon H, and James N. They only get initials. This is only the second time I've ever played Dogs. Yeah, drought.<br/><br/>I wanted to talk about the game and its rules, but then I thought of this Jim Gaffigan bit where he talks about people who've finally seen a movie that came out eight years ago and everyone's all, "go away, loser, nobody wants to discuss it any more."<br/><br/>But it was cool. So there.<br/><br/>So here's what I'll say about that particular town. None of us three Dogs fired a shot. One dog escalated to fighting, but it amounted to someone being pushed to the floor. An NPC fired at Jon's character's foot, to no consequence. And this is a town where people are slowly dying, covered in their own vomit. I had created this dude who I totally imagined as a hitler youth, and he got to do some awesome hellfire preaching and intimidating, but he didn't lay a hand on another character.<br/><br/>I enjoyed how everything worked out, but there's one thing I'd do differently. My character confronted the steward-in-training, who was shirking his duties, and who also bullied my character when they were younger. We didn't bring dice into it, and I think we should have.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not used to staying up late any more. I get up at 5:30 nowadays, and that makes 11 seem mighty overwhelmin'.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81599/#Comment_81599" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T05:28:54+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  5:28AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome back!

Apparently they were scheduled to run Burning Wheel at the same time we were set to play Dogs in my office! They ended up going to Luke's 2 blocks away because Sum 41's manager had a late night conference call but it would have been fun to run both games simultaneously in the same space.<br/><br/>There was much role playing had last night! And lots, and lots of one liners! It was pretty tense and hilarious. What I enjoyed the most was how everyone role played with the dice. The RP and dice play were one and the same. Raises and Sees flowed into each other through an often uninterrupted narration. And the conflict never seemed to drag. Everyone seemed very comfortable giving as well as escalating when needed. We also used Afraid's rule for escalating to ignore a raise which worked perfectly. <br/><br/>We definitely needed 1-1.5 additional hours. After character generation and initiation scenes, we played the town itself in 2 hours and 45 minutes. I would have loved to extend all the scenes with Amber (7 year Dog veteran, full of entitlement, demanding to marry someone who didn't love her), explore the consequences between James' character lying to Amber, have Matt further confront the Steward in training, have a final conflict with Aaron Davenport (antagonist trying to profit from the town's misfortunes), give Jon a last scene to shine, see if any wedding transpired the next day, and role play a few epilogues. A lot of what we were building to had to be rushed unfortunately. But it was a great deal of fun!<br/><br/>I didn't push as hard as I could have with Matt in the scene with Wesley, the Steward in training. I may have made Wesley's situation too relatable in some ways. There were too many understandable ways out of conflict. Which although logical, and helped build tension for later scenes, took away from Matt's momentum. I should have built on Matt's enthusiasm entering the scene with Wesley. I was too focused on the follow up conflict at the Jail, that I built towards that (since that is where James was headed as well) rather than take advantage of the obvious conflict in front of me. It was a gift I didn't fully unwrap! I would definitely push harder next time, support the conflict, and bust out the dice! <br/><br/>I loved how none of the Dogs fired a shot. It felt like they could have in a few situations but it never quite went that far. I suspect if things developed differently, if the wedding has transpired, there would have been quite a bit of gunplay. I was envisioning the wedding with 50 wealthy guests surrounded by an ocean of poverty, desperation, and death. The guests carrying elaborate gifts... the bride wearing her coat modified into a wedding dress... a diamond encrusted wedding ring in the form of the tree of life... the husband-to-be stripped naked before the crowd to match the image of him from the pornography the wife-to-be carried with her... the father yelling and screaming about the mines in the background... threatening to relinquish his aid to the town if the Dogs do not comply. That would have been ugly! If we only had more time! Hahahahahaha. <br/><br/>There was a definite holy shit moment for me when James lied to the wife-to-be, telling her that her husband had died, poisoned by her father's medicine. It was this huge twist with hundreds of possible consequences. I was like... holy shit... now what! I really wish we had more time to explore the consequences of that scene. It was huge! <br/><br/>That being said, a lot of future antagonists survived, and lot of conflicts are still begging to be resolved. A lot of "what ifs" still clawing the insides of my imagination. Great material for future games.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the player's characters. Jon's character especially. He was less forceful than the rest but also more vulnerable which gave him breathing room to reflect the events around him. He was a quiet moment in a symphony of insanity. The characters contrasted each other well. If we had more time, I would imagine there would have been more inter player character conflict.<br/><br/>11pm on a weeknight with an hour commute afterwards can be overwhelming. It's taken me a while to get used to since it's often convenient scheduling wise. But I also look forward to gaming with you all on a weekend sometime (although weekends are a lot harder for me to schedule).<br/><br/>How did you all feel about the balance between conflicts and non-conflicts?<br/><br/>What didn't work? <br/><br/>What worked? <br/><br/>Rock!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81672/#Comment_81672" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T09:07:12+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  9:07AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Plus, you're not the only one who's joined the party late.

Like Matt, I have a new/old perspective having only played Dogs twice, both within the last month.  I enjoyed our game a lot.  Like Jenskot said, lots of one-liners.  "Dogs" has a very nifty system and it's very fluid in play.  I think our characters were actually pretty plausible and well-chosen as a group, it's a pity we won't see their further adventures, particularly against such a dislikable bunch of enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough we didn't draw blood, I still committed an act of emotional violence against the Renegade Dog.  I'd like to feel guilty about it, but it had to be done, and it happened quickly and cleanly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some reflections on (what I presume to be) the thematic intentions of "Dogs", but these are complicated and idiosyncratic, perhaps best saved for another thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  Matt looks nothing like I imagined.  I imagined him as kind of looking like Luke Crane, and Luke Crane kind of looking like that big growly monster from the Muppet Show with an eye patch.

They function as storytelling cues rather than simple yes/no generators.<br><br>Anyone who's looked at Galactic might guess that I'm trying for something similar with the dice there. I like when the dice give me ideas. I remember back in the early early days, when we'd play D&amp;D and hardly anything would come into play except the die result.

X, Y and Z hate each other.  How will we ever untie this Gordian knot?"  (With the implication that we cannot untie it and will have to use force.)  And for me, that's a cue to take out my little notebook, and jot down crimes committed, social policy implications, and retributive/rehabilitative/restitutional goals for the townsfolk.  And that can usually work, given some good interview techniques and a low burden of proof.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn last night's town we may have acted a bit hastily: there was clearly something deeply wrong with the Renegade Dog, her father, and her fiance, and we imposed a quickie-solution on it in the interests of time.  But I don't think we erred too badly: if you squint it looks like justice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, everyone else was like, "Cool, we solved the town without firing a shot" and I was like, "Shucks, I was hoping to see where my technique breaks down."<br/>\n<br/>\n(I would really like to see a Dogs game where all the participants are judges, policemen, and theologians in real life.  With teenage children to use as models for Dogs.  Somebody arrange that, and record it for me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81748/#Comment_81748" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T11:39:15+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:39AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This wasn't my first time playing the game, but it was the first time everything really started to click for me.

Of course, Tony Lower-Basch is a rat bastard GM who kept pushing and pushing and made me pull my damn gun.  I half expected him to make me use it actually.
