Let me share stuff that stuck on my mind.<br/><br/>Firstly, Jonathan Lavallee has been attempting capsule reviews of every game over on <a href="http://gamishdesigner.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Gamish Designer</a>. Wow! Thanks for your generosity, Jon.<br/><br/><b>Snowy Mountain Syndrome</b> is a remarkably complete game, with ready-to-play characters and situation, intricate currencies to track your state, and the great old premise that you and the rest of the settlers are not going to make it out of there. There's lots to look at (and steal) from this game, especially as more people look for designing ready-to-play situations into the game.<br/><br/><b>Handle With Care</b> is a really touching and charming LARP idea involving monsters. It's a joy to read the text.<br/><br/><b>Into the Void</b> [fixed] was a promising entry into the space madness genre, and like it's approach to the creep of insanity/disaster while the crew of the Lantern moves along to its destination.<br/><br/><b>This Match is Scheduled for One Fall</b> has some smart stuff about pro-wrestling, but also hidden goals, interlocking mechanics between players, and splitting a character into multiple playable personas. And wrestling!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383885/#Comment_383885" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T11:37:43+00:00" title="June 29, 2012 11:37AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kira Scott's <b>Into the Void</b>: This is a "space madness" game that does some interesting things with traits that migrate on and off the character's sheet which are used to inspire the GM to come up with horrifying/hallucinatory imagery. I'm not sure I got everything in the game, but I liked that there was mechanical support for trying to make things scary and personal rather than just asking the GM's instincts to carry the entire load.<br/><br/>Zachary Donovan's <b>Young Turks at the Cafe</b>: The "comfortable people discuss politics" premise of this game was not something I expected, but I thought there was a cool and subtle thing going on with the "put this question in the void" mechanic that makes the game more about discussion than about bickering or debate.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383887/#Comment_383887" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T11:57:38+00:00" title="June 29, 2012 11:57AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><b>Space Madness</b> was a promising entry into the space madness genre, and like it's approach to the creep of insanity/disaster while the crew of the Lantern moves along to its destination.</blockquote>\nWhich game is this, exactly?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383888/#Comment_383888" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T11:58:33+00:00" title="June 29, 2012 11:58AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Corrected myself above - I meant Into The Void.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383891/#Comment_383891" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T12:40:48+00:00" title="June 29, 2012 12:40PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Guilty!</b> has an awesome mechanic where the prosecution and defense integrate information from real newspaper accounts when they plead their case.<br/><br/><b>The Entropy Game</b> has to be a broad satire of the culture of the Forge.
