I imagine play being something like this:<br/>1) Setting - The group brainstorms elements of setting and situation, which are written randomly onto a largish piece of paper. Then, a Ouija session "builds" the world." (Universalis &amp; IAWA)<br/>2) Characters - On a new sheet, appropriate character archetypes for the setting are written into boxes, as are as many relevant traits or aspects that they players want. A Ouija session, then, "creates" characters.<br/>3) Resolution - Whenever outcomes are at stake between two or more adversaries, they are written in random locations on a new sheet (small is fine, as it's per-conflict). A Ouija session determines stakes resolution.<br/>4) Reward - Every time a player wished, he or she can write (in a random location) a reward for a character. An end-of-play Ouija session determines who gets what rewards.<br/><br/>Long story short: making the board(s) is at least as significant as "cooperative resolution" using a Ouija planchette.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
