Apparently I had bought about a million years ago but never actually read it. I was curious as to how this book - published in 1987 - had stood up to the test of time, and if there were any gems of wisdom in there that could be successfully salvaged.<br/><br/>The answer so far is - no, probably not. But as I read it, I will use this thread for commentary and will make sure I reveal any hidden gems I do find, plus poke fun at things I find especially wrong.<br/><br/>I'm only around chapter 2 right now, but from today's perspective, the book is a mess.<br/><br/>In the introduction, Gygax mentions he hopes that people interested in roleplaying games will read the book before playing, which will improve their experience greatly. His greatest disappointment seems to be the people who try get into the game, play it "wrong" or with people who don't know how to play it "right", figures it's not for them and quits. In this, he and I share a motivation - I too think that most everyone can find something worthwhile in roleplaying, but that playing a game "wrong" is a surefire way to get the impression it's not your thing, so this premise excited me.<br/><br/>He proceeds by introducing the concept of the "masters" - a "small group of enthusiasts" who have "mastered" the art of roleplaying. He assumes the reader is not part of this clique, but probably thinks they are. The book seems to be written from the standpoint of a member of an esoteric elite introducing a chosen ignorant follower to the Mysteries by way of vague allegories and subtle hints instead of explicit instruction, while assuring the reader that there is great wisdom to be learned if they follow some exact yet unspoken steps. This is somewhat off-putting.<br/><br/>Chapter 1 (Roleplaying: the Foundation of Fun) is about the concept of roleplaying, and covers things like the history of D&amp;D, why roleplaying is fun and useful, and why all the terror-mongers are wrong about D&amp;D causing death, suicide and satanism.<br/><br/>Notably, despite Gygax' claim in the intro of having written the book partly for those new to the hobby, he doesn't define what roleplaying <i>is</i>. He doesn't talk about the different roles, social dynamics, activities, techniques, immersion vs non-immersion, different playstyles, or whatever. This could be expected, I suppose - we didn't have the terminology to talk about a lot of these things back in the 80s, and furthermore - as far as Gygax <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is</span> appears to be concerned - there is but One True Way to play the Great Game of D&amp;D, and it is The Way of the Master and needs No Further Explanation. However, this lack of definition becomes a blatant flaw later in the book, as we shall see.<br/><br/>Another gripe in this chapter comes from this: Gygax rarely talks about D&amp;D specifically, preferring to speak about "roleplaying" in general, and even offers examples of game genres like sci-fi, secret agent and horror. He never names names, but it's occasionally obvious what games he's referring to, since the selection was rather small back then ("You can choose between literally dozens of games!") - Call of Cthulhu is an obvious one, for example. However, he then introduces as gospel D&amp;D specific tropes, like "Alignments" and "Classes", and how to deal with them in-game. This makes it sound like he's trying to be accepting of the existence of other games, while shoe-horning them into the mold of AD&amp;D. This does the book a great disservice, since it's supposedly intended to teach skills universally applicable to roleplaying games as a whole.<br/><br/>The gripe torrent does not slow down with Chapter 2 (The Master Player). The biggest one I've encountered so far is that now, Gygax seems to use the word "roleplaying" to refer to the activity of play and the act of immersive character acting interchangeably. This is why a definition would have been a great idea, because I know a fair number of (A)D&amp;D players who rarely enters Actor Stance yet still has plenty of fun with the game. "Make sure you play your role to the hilt", Gygax assures us, giving some examples of stereotypical acting based on class ("A magic user should act mysterious, while a cleric should be righteous and wise") but gives us no particular reason <i>why</i> we should do this or why it would make our game any better. Having played these games since 1989, I think his point is partly accurate but his presentation very imprecise and vague. Had this been 1987 and I was a newcomer to the hobby armed with this book, I'd be more confused than I was before reading it.<br/><br/>A very concerning contradiction is with regards to character and player separation. In multiple locations prior to Chapter 2, Gygax talks of how there is a clear separation between character and player, and that "a master will understand this intuitively" or some similarly vaguely insulting handwave. However, in Chapter 2, a checklist provided for players include making sure to pick a character type that will provide a useful set of skills and abilities to the player group - frex, if the party has no cleric, make a cleric instead of yet another fighter. The reason is not because <i>you</i> will appreciate carving your own niche, but because the <i>group</i> will want to maximize efficiency. This is fine and dandy, from a gamist Us-vs-the-DM perspective.<br/><br/>Here's the but. But, then he goes on to talk about roleplaying your character a certain way, and then <i>reverts</i> to stating that if you're playing a cleric, and you're not providing your healing services fairly to the party members, or demanding payment for your services, then this behaviour will cause <i>inter-<b>player</b></i> strife! All these statements seem entirely incongruent to my mind: First, make a character for purpose of gamist efficiency. Then, ensure that your character has a personality and will act according to what the game world deems logically necessary. Then, ensure that you act according to the wishes of your <i>fellow players</i>. It's as if he invented an entirely new Stance (sorry, I'm on a Big Model trip) - Communist Author Stance, or something like that, where <i>you</i> are not allowed to decide what you want your character to do, but your character has to act in accordance with what the rest of the group's players want to ensure party cooperation.<br/><br/>So far, I think the book reads like GG's stream-of-consciousness on the subject, with many ideas that aren't well thought out or presented. I'm also put off by the esoteric tone. As a book for roleplaying beginners, I'm afraid that in this day and age the book would do far more harm than good.<br/><br/>I will keep posting observations and anecdotes from the book and if I find anything of use, I'll be sure to report it.

This is a predecessor, I suppose, to the Forge-ish belief that deconstructing Actual Play sessions is the best way of understanding how a game works, why it works that way, and how it could be improved.<br/><br/>As an example, Gygax offers the insight that in AD&amp;D, a base assumption is that humans and the demi-human races (i.e. player races) are all generally good. There is evil in the world, but generally good, noble heroes have always been able to beat it back and ensure that order and goodness prevails in the end. You play these good, noble heroes.<br/><br/>By stating this, it made a couple of things click for me. My great gaming curse was being introduced to White Wolf WoD and its world of moral ambiguities, playing the hell out of that system with some limited amount of "success", and then returning to fantasy-based hack-and-slash gaming mostly because I couldn't find any other local groups to join. I falsely assumed that my affinity towards more "Bang-oriented" play (though had we known the exact definition of bangs at the time, and directed play consciously towards them, our experience would certainly have been much better) was mostly a result of my maturation, and that others gamers my age or older would share my tastes. I now understand that when my ex-DM, who was going on 40 at the time, built a campaign world based around pure good-vs-evil and made a plot centered around the fetching of the holy McGuffin to save the world, he wasn't being immature and wouldn't be impressed by the shades-of-grey and internal strife of my pacifist half-orc monk. Instead, he'd be annoyed that I tried to take the focus away from his carefully balanced encounters by having internal doubts about the wholesale execution of an entire orc tribe while we were in the middle of miniature combat. Fact is, the kill-them-and-take-their-stuff model works best without moral ambiguity to get in the way.<br/><br/>Thus, in the (for this example) wise words of Gary Gygax, assume that your dudes are the good guys. Other minis on the battle map are evil. They probably have stuff you'd like, and you're perfectly justified in killing them and taking that stuff. If you do that enough times you'll get more powerful. This is good.<br/><br/>Similarly, alignment is a tool by which to keep consistency to your roleplay and a mechanical device for supernatural abilities, not a constraint to be slavishly adhered to - a DM that constantly puts your character in situations where they can choose between following their alignment or get cool stuff, then punish you for choosing not to go along with your alignment, is an abusive DM. These never-ending RPG.net threads discussing the nuances of alignments or the alien nature of elves are pointless - these things should not matter in a D&amp;D game, and most games will only be worse for trying to include them.<br/><br/>If you want to play moral ambiguity in a fantasy setting, run it in Burning Wheel or something - that system actually support it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89952/#Comment_89952" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T19:24:42+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  7:24PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Communist Author Stance, or something like that, where<i>you</i>are not allowed to decide what you want your character to do, but your character has to act in accordance with what the rest of the group's players want...</blockquote>\nCareful there, you've nearly described Social Contract--  and you've worded it like theRPGpundit would.<br/><br/>By that line of reasoning 'GM-less' and collaborative-story games are insidious hive-cult propaganda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rossum" title="rossum"><img alt="rossum" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/947/nTPPT1DBWIRKA.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rossum">rossum</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89980/#Comment_89980" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T23:02:28+00:00" title="August 23, 2007 11:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a copy of this in one of my RPG boxes.

That's a good point.<br/><br/>But I think there's a nuance in there that you missed, that may only become obvious when reading the book letter by letter. My complaint is that Social Contract includes <i>you</i>. In fact, most models maintain that <i>you</i> are the only person who have authority over the narration of your character, though naturally you need to act within the bounds of the Social Contract for the benefit of the group. What Gygax was implying was that you should always narrate your character's actions to suit the Social Contract, essentially putting the gamist needs of the rest of your group ahead of your own immersive needs, yet still ensuring that your character acts in a manner constrained by the fiction - and if you fail in either of these people would be entitled to be upset with you. I can't see this as being possible with anything but the most cardboard-cutout of characters, completely devoid of motivations, values or personality.<br/><br/>I guess the bottom line could be that if I fail at this, I am not a "Roleplaying Master", eh? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>\n<blockquote>By that line of reasoning 'GM-less' and collaborative-story games are insidious hive-cult propaganda.</blockquote>\nYou lost me there.

The theme of D&amp;D, as much as it has one, is being a good guy <i>while</i> getting rich and powerful, not being a good guy <i>or</i> getting rich and powerful.  A GM who makes players choose between the two is denying the premise of the game, and forcing the players to make a choice that the game does not mechanically support.  To be successful, a bang has to to be equally rewarding no matter what the player chooses.  Choosing to avoid a fight, or turn down loot doesn't provide an interesting gaming experience, it just stops the game from going anywhere.  I'm not saying that this can't be done with D&amp;D at all, it's just that D&amp;D isn't a great game to support this, since making a moral choice like this in the game means failing to rengage with the game's primary reward mechanic (going up levels).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90825/#Comment_90825" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T20:17:47+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  8:17PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>A GM who makes players choose between the two is denying the premise of the game, and forcing the players to make a choice that the game does not mechanically support.</blockquote>\nWTF?

I'm saying that D&amp;D isn't a very good set of rules to use to play a game about making those choices.  <br/><br/>When I say the game does not "mechanically support" the choice not to fight, I mean that, mechanically, there's no result from that choice.  It's disengaging from the mechanics of play, which are about going up levels.  The player, of course, can choose for the character not to fight, but the mechanical result of that, over time, is that the character's ability to affect the game world decreases (their power level drops relative to the rest of the world).  I can see how you could read me as saying "you can't choose not to fight in D&amp;D", but that's not what I mean.  I mean "choosing not to fight in D&amp;D, over the long term, makes for a game that's not so much fun".  A game which makes player fun dependant on making a particular moral choice about the theme probably isn't a good game for exploring that theme.<br/><br/>I'm finding your response pretty agressive, which is making me not want to have this discussion.  Are we both on the same page in terms of understanding that this is not about whether D&amp;D is a "good" game, and simply about whether it's a good game for exploring choices between personal power, and personal morality?

You summed it up very well in your first response, I thought.<br/><br/>Let's put it this way. Gygax states, in the book which this thread is about, that alignment is a mechanism that allows you to maintain consistency in your roleplaying, i.e. character acting. It is a crutch for you as a player to rely upon. The rules have also been modeled to make occasional use of this "Alignment stat", usually when determining results of divine magics. He makes this statement in the section where he discusses the "Spirit" of the game of (A)D&amp;D, as being a game where the players portray good, noble heroes. His point is that this is what the game <b>is</b>, and to achieve "mastery" (i.e. maximize your fun, in my words) you must play a game according to its nature.<br/><br/>Thus, in my interpretation and view, alignment is not a "flag" to the DM to centre play around issues and choices stemming from a player's chosen alignment. When I choose to play a Lawful Good Paladin in D&amp;D, I choose to send a message to the DM that I want to portray a really good guy, righteous and steadfast in my beliefs. I am <b>not</b> sending a message to the DM that I want to explore how one can truly be good, divine and holy while still being the guardian of an absolute rule of law, especially under a corrupt lawmaker. Similarly, if I play a True Neutral Druid, that means I want to play a game where I am free to take whichever side I want and still have a perfectly valid justification for my behaviour - not that I want to be put in a position where I am forced to side with the forces of Evil because Good is growing too powerful, especially if that means I will be shunned by the rest of my party.<br/><br/>In a different game, all these choices may lead to awesome. In D&amp;D, these things aren't hard choices, they are choices between getting to play the character I created with the rules the game system offers, versus playing a character who is constantly being called into question and not getting to count on the system for support in the process.<br/><br/>For Gygax, Bang-driven, hard-choice play is not what (A)D&amp;D is about. Some may be successfully playing the game that way but I would suggest that you are using a whole subsystem of implicit social rules in doing so to ensure that players aren't getting fed up. In a setting where the DM is pushing for such play, against the Spirit of D&amp;D and likely without coming to an explicit understanding with all the players, the DM is indeed being abusive. SHe is questioning the players' character choices and tastes and is constantly trying to make the game be about something <b>other</b> than that which he has been flagged for.<br/><br/>It's much like trying to play Monopoly with some jerk whining you're not being fair by overcharging him for rent on Boardwalk, and why don't you think of his five starving kids at home before you try to extort him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91103/#Comment_91103" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T14:23:55+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  2:23PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Previous was X-posted with Mike)<br/><br/>Jason, if you take offense at the "abuse" statement, understand that I'm not saying the DM is necessarily malicious. Like Mike said, "accidental torture" is indeed a better term for situations when the DM doesn't know any better. I would not water it down any more than that though - like all participants around the table, the DM is there to give and receive entertainment. If the DM thinks hir role is to challenge the players to deeper, more meaningful character development by calling into question the choices they made when they first sat down to determine what kind of game they wanted to play, then SHe is in direct breach of a social contract very prominent in (A)D&amp;D - the game is about killing things, taking their stuff, leveling your little dudes, and having light-hearted fun doing it.<br/><br/>Take a game like Burning Wheel, with built-in mechanical support for Beliefs and Instincts with rewards associated with making hard choices regarding them, and lifepaths like "Thug" instead of "Rogue", and you have a totally different implicit social contract where such play makes perfect sense. The players are sitting down <b>explicitly looking for</b> such play, and it'd be abuse not to facilitate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91280/#Comment_91280" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T07:21:26+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  7:21AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 7:23AM by jzn.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, burning wheel would never have been created if it wasnt for DM's pushing their players' buttons in D&amp;D; in this "abusive" way.

D&amp;D didn't work to fulfill the needs of that market. Thus, Luke included mechanics for such play in BW because that market needed a product to fill its needs.<br/>That doesn't mean that pushing such play in D&amp;D is a good idea. It means that players were misled (or misled themselves) into thinking they could fulfill this need with a game like D&amp;D, found that they couldn't, and gravitated elsewhere (or not).<br/>In an ideal world, players should have been able to identify that this was the kind of play they were looking for, realize that D&amp;D does not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">support</span> facilitate such play, and go elsewhere, write their own game, or at least add a bunch of house rules to D&amp;D (*grinds teeth*) to facilitate such play. In today's day and age, where there's dozens of games that support such play, there is no longer any excuse whatsoever to continue fumbling in the dark with D&amp;D if that's the kind of play you're looking for.<br/><br/>But the world is not ideal and players tried (and tries) to do this thing with D&amp;D. This, in my opinion, is a very bad thing - as bad as trying to make Dogs a game about shootouts with sinners, or (my personal cross to bear) an investigation game. The <b>playstyle</b> is perfectly valid, you see - just not with D&amp;D as its engine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91290/#Comment_91290" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T07:46:36+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  7:46AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 7:47AM by lachek.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And for clarity, D&amp;D is also a perfectly valid engine.

Dude. Yes, of course this is situational. I never claimed otherwise.<br><br>What I do claim is that these situations are more widespread than you might imagine. Of course, I'm basing that exclusively on my own experiences, the experiences of others in my circle of gamers, and the experiences of others posting on game boards such as this. I have not performed any extensive empirical research on the subject - it falls exclusively into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness" rel="nofollow">truthiness</a> category at this point in time. But I do believe it.<br><br>I'm basing this on lines from DM's like:<br/><br/>"I've been trying to introduce some hard choices for the players to deal with, but they just avoid them and go straight for the killing. I don't understand why my player seems bored with everything but combat."<br/><br/>Or this line from a thread on WOTC's message board:<br/><br/>"Since they were both good aligned, I reminded them that killing someone who surrendered to them amounted to murder and therefore an evil act." This was followed up by a rules argument where the Book of Exalted Deeds was dragged out and referenced as gospel. The DM wanted to punish the players with an alignment change, the players wanted to kill the surrendering cultist and felt the action fell within the scope of their alignment.<br/><br/>Or my own experience, as a player accidentally torturing the DM:<br/><br/>"Man, this campaign is going to kick ass, I'm going to explore some deep character issues and assert that orcish culture is really not that difference if seen in a different context... it's going to be about my character's constant temptation to succumb to his primal nature but in the end he will overcome it and transcend into a blissful, pacified state due to his acceptance of violence as a part of the nature of cosmos. Awesome! I've written a 12 page background that outlines all these things from the perspective of a young half-orc and gives all these hooks for the DM to start weaving the story around. Wait... why are we fighting all these bandits? What do you mean "we have to save the orphanage that's being attacked by an evil wizard"? Our party has a half-angel, wtf is up with that?? Ummm... we're in the market shopping for magical items AGAIN? Well, I guess I'll just sit here and sulk until someone other than me notices that's not what the Grande Arte of roleplaying is all about."<br/><br/>Gygax addresses some misconceptions in the book, misconceptions which I believe is what keeps quite a few people from enjoying D&amp;D. Some of those misconceptions have been propagated through the editions in the game text itself, but the majority of them are pollutants spread on message boards or face to face.<br/><br/>If you do Bang-style game with your group and everyone is enjoying themselves, awesome! I think there are better systems to consistently generate good Bang-style play, but to each his own - I understand the notion that someone likes to stick with a system they or their friends know well. But if some in your group are expecting Bang-style play and aren't getting it, or if the DM is trying to enforce Bang-style play and the players aren't interested, there's some serious miscommunication going on. Miscommunication in an activity which is all about communication can, and does, hurt players and the hobby.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91359/#Comment_91359" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T12:26:44+00:00" title="August 29, 2007 12:26PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, screw it. This is an overly complex discussion around a simple subject.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D ruleset is very suitable for killing monsters, taking their stuff, and increasing in personal power.<br/>The BW ruleset is very suitable for telling grim and gritty stories in a fantasy setting.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, the conflict lies in whether or not my character will be instrumental in the defeat of evil forces and will be rewarded richly in the process. I am interested in finding out his this conflict resolves and will play towards this resolution using the tools provided. I don't want the conflict to be redirected to centre instead around the tools I have chosen. I want my choice of tools to open doors for me with regards to how I want to approach the conflict, not narrow my choices of approach.<br/><br/>In Burning Wheel, the conflict revolves around the characters' Beliefs. I am interested in finding out how the resolution of the conflict changes the characters and will play towards the resolution using the tools provided - for example, Lifepaths. I don't want my choice of Lifepaths to be challenged and have play centre around the restrictions imposed on me because I chose 6 lifepaths instead of 5, or the life of a noble instead of the life of a peasant. These are tools I use to drive play, not issues I want challenged - unless stated up front that this is a game about oppressive medieval society and make sure your Beliefs focus around that.<br/><br/>Some groups may want BW style play but enjoy d20. That's cool, but runs counter to intuition when one considers what types of conflicts the two different games address. Similarly, some folk may want D&amp;D style play but choose BW to do it - I'd imagine these are the groups that complain long and hard about how cumbersome and chaotic the combat system is and how Artha is kinda weird, never realizing that Beliefs are not just personalized Alignments and the game isn't really about kicking evil butt.<br/><br/>Look, I'm all for creativity, and I love mods and hacks. I just don't think it's very creative to take a Hummer and turn it into a motorcycle with wings, or vice versa - especially if the creative mechanism one tries to use in doing so is just to wave your hand over the Hummer and say "Lo - 'tis now a winged motorcycle". Sure, Alignment can be messed with to look and feel like Beliefs, and then play can be centred around that - but it's ugly, cumbersome and poorly defined, and more often than not the DM that attempts this does it in secret without informing the players, and the rule by which Alignment gets manipulated is pure DM fiat. Often, this is not by malice but through some sort of implicit understanding that this will bring about "good RP".<br/><br/>Gygax explicitly settles this notion in "Roleplaying Mastery", in what I think is one of the better points he's made so far in the book. Find what the game is about. Centre play around that. Don't make mountains out of molehills. Alignment is a tool the player uses to roleplay their character.

You're wrong though - that's not how I play D&amp;D. That's how I <i>wish</i> I'd played D&amp;D when I <i>did</i> play D&amp;D. Instead, my D&amp;D experience was a complete and utter disaster, because I was <i>trying</i> really hard to play D&amp;D Bang-style. I think we had about a 50/50 split down the middle in our group, but the DM was strictly on the more Gamist, boardgamey, kill-the-monsters-get-the-loot side. It ended up with the group fracturing pretty much down the middle, along the same lines, because we just couldn't understand each others' playstyles.<br/><br/>And as I mentioned, I believe it was <i>I</i> who subjected the DM to "accidental torture" in my case, by trying to force play in a direction it wasn't headed - not only because the DM didn't want it to, but because such gameplay could not be expressed within the scope of the game's mechanics it was really very similar to my example above of playing Monopoly and trying to plead to the other players' sense of pity for imaginary children.<br/><br/>If you tack on a system of character creation and social manipulation rules to Monopoly, or you free-form it using an intricate social system only your group understands, I'm sure such a game could be greatly enjoyed. Integrate rules for sabotaging the Railroad. Maybe cutting power to the Hotels if you control the power utility? Hell, maybe you could put a big piece of cake in the middle of the Monopoly board and whenever someone passed Go you took a bite out of the cake - that'd be tasty! I'm really not here to judge anyone's fun or accuse them of torture, abuse or otherwise as long as everyone's happy. But if you mess with the Spirit of the game, and that makes a player unhappy, don't come and claim that's just a different way of playing the game and what the hell are you whining about.  You're playing a <i>different game</i> than stock.<br/><br/>Really, I don't know how to phrase this any clearer - Gary Gygax says that to emphasize Alignment as something other than a tool which the player can use to roleplay his character is to overemphasize its role in the game. That's no different than Vincent Baker releasing an errata for Dogs with a major clarification to the text to clear up some confusion that caused major debate on the Forge. Of course, that doesn't invalidate a particular group's communal playstyle, but it should definitely de-legitimize it as an "official" method for play. (Yeah, I know GG is not the end-all-be-all of D&amp;D, especially in its current iteration. But he's really one of the best we got on the subject, ain't he?)<br/><br/>Finally, James, if there's too many flaws to point them out, why don't you start with one or two factual or logical errors rather than paraphrasing an entire thread with a dismissive snicker? Like I said, I'm glad to have been of comical service, but you're not really contributing much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91393/#Comment_91393" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T13:38:37+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  1:38PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>James, I'm glad I amused you.

This doesn't mean that the game itself can't be played that way, just that your 50/50 split group run by a guy who wanted to focus more on hack-and-slash doesn't fit your style.\n<blockquote>And as I mentioned, I believe it was<i>I</i>who subjected the DM to "accidental torture" in my case, by trying to force play in a direction it wasn't headed - not only because the DM didn't want it to, but because such gameplay could not be expressed within the scope of the game's mechanics it was really very similar to my example above of playing Monopoly and trying to plead to the other players' sense of pity for imaginary children.</blockquote>\nWhy do D&amp;D's mechanics disallow roleplaying and bang-driven play?\n<blockquote>If you tack on a system of character creation and social manipulation rules to Monopoly. . .</blockquote>\nAs D&amp;D is not a board game, I'll skim past this seeming nonsequiter.\n<blockquote>Really, I don't know how to phrase this any clearer - Gary Gygax says that to emphasize Alignment as something other than a tool which the player can use to roleplay his character is to overemphasize its role in the game.</blockquote>\n1) Gary Gygax is wrong. <br/><br/>2) Why do you need alignment to be tied to your bangs? \n<blockquote>That's no different than Vincent Baker releasing an errata for Dogs with a major clarification to the text to clear up some confusion that caused major debate on the Forge.</blockquote>\nOf course it is. This book isn't an erratta of any kind, official or otherwise.\n<blockquote>Of course, that doesn't invalidate a particular group's communal playstyle, but it should definitely de-legitimize it as an "official" method for play. (Yeah, I know GG is not the end-all-be-all of D&amp;D, especially in its current iteration. But he's really one of the best we got on the subject, ain't he?)</blockquote>\nNow I have to worry about what's "official method."  In my decades of D&amp;D nobody ever tried to tell me what was official. I think I'm getting an idea of what turned you off of it, if you gamed with people that demanded you tow some sort of party line.\n<blockquote>Finally, James, if there's too many flaws to point them out, why don't you start with one or two factual or logical errors rather than paraphrasing an entire thread with a dismissive snicker? Like I said, I'm glad to have been of comical service, but you're not really contributing much.</blockquote>\nBecause "this is how I played, so it can't be played differently" is deserving of little more than a derisive snicker. If you can't see that yourself it's gauranteed that I won't be able to convince you otherwise. Bit I'm bored, so I'll play along. <br/><br/>Have fun, I know I did. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91395/#Comment_91395" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T13:39:25+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  1:39PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>When I say the game does not "mechanically support" the choice not to fight, I mean that, mechanically, there's no result from that choice.</blockquote>\n???<br/><br/>I still don't get it.<br/><br/>Of course there is a mechanical result from the choice not to fight something.

One of the players was playing a monk belonging to an order of book-protecting kung-fu librarians.  One of his hooks was that he was chasing down a volume that had been stolen from the library on his watch. He located the book.  I, as DM, presented him with a fairly simple dilemma.  The book actually had been stolen from the clerisy of an evil god before it had belonged to the kung fu librarians.  It was one of their prized possessions because it allowed them to partly harness forces of oblivion to do their evil deeds (the setting had rules, skills, magic, equipment, items and so on surrounding these forces of oblivion, so I had mechanical support for the creation of the book.)  He learned this history of the book while searching for it. After its recovery, he had to decide between returning the book to his order (and fighting the bastards demanding it from him) or returning it to the evil clerics.  This is your typical "lawful" character conundrum, it's nothing special, there are similar situations in modules and campaign guides back to the mid-90s.<br/><br/>He decided to turn the book over to the evil clerics and not fight them.  I, the DM, wrote down "bastards have book" in my notes, clipped the paper in which I described the book's effects to that page, and worked out what the effects of the bad guys having the book would be based on the resources they had, the intentions they had, the rules for the magic and the items and so on, and put down some notes for how the players might come across some of these consequences in their later travels.<br/><br/>At every stage of this process, the D&amp;D rules (and WW supplements) provided me with mechanical support:<br/><br/>1 - coming up with this book (WW rules for evil oblivion magic, etc.)<br/>2 - coming up with the situation (alignment descriptions, WW description of monkish order, DMG world design material)<br/>3 - presenting the situation (skill rolls, combat rolls, reaction checks, etc.)<br/>4 - resolving the situation (what I do as DM, what the player does as player, skill system, combat system, etc.)<br/>5 - figuring out the consequences of the situation (previous rules for evil oblivion magic, faction rules from DMG, WW description of the agendae of the gods and their various splintered churches, etc.)<br/><br/>I don't see anything in this which is "just roleplay" except maybe a piece of 4, and even our "just roleplay" was informed by our understanding of the world created (following the guidelines in the DMG, etc.) and the skill system that described how perceptive the character was, etc.  And there's no dilemma if the character's not "lawful".<br/><br/>As for the other players being nasty to him, on the contrary, everyone said the decision was raw awesome served raw.<br/><br/><b>That's</b> why I don't get this "no mechanical support" thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91417/#Comment_91417" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T14:28:37+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  2:28PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 2:33PM by lachek.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: Cross posted with JD. Hi JD.<br/><br/>The party, consisting of two fighters, an elven wizard and a ranger, encounters three orcs led by an ogre in the middle of the forest.<br/><br/>Gygax says: "Kill the monsters by using a tactical combat system. Insert cool character acting while doing it, contributing to the atmosphere of the situation and the SIS."<br/>An alternative playstyle says: "The ranger is True Neutral and doesn't judge these potentially misunderstood creatures until they've been shown to be anathema to nature's creation or dangerous to the cosmic balance. The elven wizard worships some nature Goddess who hates ogres and orcs. One fighter is Lawful Good and knows the creatures to be evil. The other is heartbroken over the loss of his sister."<br/><br/>The combat, played out using what I will call the Gygax philosophy, might go:<br/><br/>Ranger: Quickly climbs a tree and fires an arrow at one of the orcs. "These woods are not yours, foul orc! You should never have ventured here!"<br/>Wizard: Prepares a Fireball. "You will burn in the Flames of Luanda! (mutters under breath) hopefully the Flames of Luanda won't burn down too much vegetation..."<br/>Fighter 1: Charges the ogre. "Die by my blade!"<br/>Fighter 2: Charges an orc. "I will crush you! Jenna will be avenged!"<br/><br/>By the alternative method:<br/><br/>Ranger: "Let's hold off until we know what their purpose in these woods are."<br/>Wizard: "I should smite them, but the Flames of Luanda will burn down half these woods!"<br/>Fighter 1: Charges the ogre. "Die by my blade!" (player speaking) Crap. I'm gonna totally bite it.<br/>Fighter 2: (collapsed on the ground) "Jenna, how could you leave me? Why, oh why?"<br/><br/>Now, I can see that the players using the alternative method could have been a bit smarter in their choices of actions to ensure that their conditions for acting were being met while still allowing the players to kick some ogre ass, but the point is that they are *restricted* by the choices they made in the game or circumstances that have arisen in the game. They cannot "justify" performing the actions their players really want to do. In the worst case scenario, the DM is the orchestrator behind this:<br/><br/>"Ranger, if you attack them you will go against your alignment - they may be evil, but they haven't threatened you yet. Attack them and I'll have to move you towards Chaotic. Wizard, listen, if you cast a Fireball you'll probably burn down the forest. That'll make Luanda real pissed. Fighter 1, you better attack that ogre, he's like super-evil! If you don't, you're not a very Lawful Good Fighter now are ya? Fighter 2, sorry but you're just overcome with grief."<br/><br/>In the end, this playstyle prevents players from enjoying the mechanics the game provides, which in the case of D&amp;D 3/3.5 is mostly miniature combat. It does so by unnecessarily restricting their choices, and the risk of breaking the restrictions is that the tools or flavours they've picked for their character will go away. I can't imagine a playgroup for which this would be fun!<br/><br/>The result of the two different approaches are these:<br/><br/>Gygax form: The characters get a bunch of XP, maybe some gold and stuff, maybe someone even gains a level and gets new abilities to play with. Woohoo!<br/><br/>Alternative form: Fighter 1 will likely get crushed since he has no support from the rest of his group. Eventually the Ranger might come around as he sees the destruction of the forest. The wizard will use up all her Magic Missiles (no chance of collateral damage) and provide some minimal assistance. Maybe the DM will let Player 2 fight back if he's attacked - sweet. Maybe they'll even win. OK, so in the end they get the same stuff as in Gygax form. Unfortunately, they don't seem to care too much about those rewards since their game doesn't really revolve around killing monsters at all. They get no reward for all the restrictions they imposed on themselves at all, and while they may have gotten some enjoyment out of the "roleplaying" they did it's unlikely to have been much more than the first group gained.<br/><br/>In a system like Burning Wheel (which, please, I'm only using as a comparison of an alternate fantasy RPG system - this is not a competition) the players would gain Artha by restricting their actions according to their Beliefs and Instincts. The Artha can be used as XP to increase stats or "hero points" to achieve success at tasks or in combat. However, in BW, combat is deadlier and more chaotic - if you get into combat, you may die. Thus, you tend to avoid combat as much as possible, focusing on pushing towards your character's Beliefs (which are essentially Bangs).<br/><br/>Am I making it clear why I think one system favours one playstyle, and another favours a different playstyle? Why one system rewards a certain type of play and why another system rewards a different one? Why, in D&amp;D, using tools and character sheet artifacts as action-restricting factors are not good for drama or story, but prohibitive to maximizing player fun? Note - not impossible, prohibitive. If you really love d20, and you're an awesome DM with a lot of insight and wisdom, and your players are all on the same page, go for it. But due to the fact that D&amp;D does not intuitively function in this way, that's probably not a great way to approach the game outside of your fully functional play group. Is that a reasonable enough definition of "official" for you, James?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91421/#Comment_91421" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T14:53:32+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  2:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 2:56PM by lachek.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, I just don't see - like, at all - how that is anything like Bang-driven play. That's not an insult. It's just not a Bang.<br/><br/>It's a <b>choice</b> based on the character's Alignment. Yes, maybe even a hard choice. But, the player didn't drive it there - there was a fork in the road at a certain point in the plot. D&amp;D is great at this - as you said, you take a character's choice, create a consequence, and file it away until you can create a sideplot or a major plot twist with it. The player got awesome either way - a choice between chocolate and vanilla awesome.<br/><br/>My original statement was this:\n<blockquote>Similarly, alignment is a tool by which to keep consistency to your roleplay and a mechanical device for supernatural abilities, not a constraint to be slavishly adhered to - a DM that constantly puts your character in situations where they can choose between following their alignment or get cool stuff, then punish you for choosing not to go along with your alignment, is an abusive DM. These never-ending RPG.net threads discussing the nuances of alignments or the alien nature of elves are pointless - these things should not matter in a D&amp;D game, and most games will only be worse for trying to include them.</blockquote>\nPlease note the "constraint", "slavish adherence" and "punish" words. They're important. It would have means something else if I'd said "opportunity", "open for player interpretation" and "reward".<br/><br/>The big question is, had the player decided to keep the book in the custody of his character's order, would you have punished the player by saying "Well, you're now Neutral, not Lawful". Or, when the player made the choice to give the book back, did you tell him he was now allied with the forces of Darkness? That's what I'm talking about - or more specifically, a choice consisting of "Attack the orc, get to play with the rules, kick some ass, get some XP and gold - but if you do that, you'll get a DM smackdown because you're Lawful and it's not Orc Hunting Season yet".<br/><br/>While in Burning Wheel, to paraphrase Clyde Rhoer, you might be given a choice of "Let your kingdom live under a tyrannical illegitimate king, or depose your brother and instate yourself as the true crown - but then the kingdom will fall, as per the Prophecy". You will be mechanically rewarded either way, and your choices will serve to enrich the game experience. Or an even better example, in Dogs in the Vineyard - complete a town, solve all their problems - get a new Trait. Fail miserably, get shot and chased out - get a new Trait. Either choice leads to growth and opportunity for you as a player, not restriction and failure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91423/#Comment_91423" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T15:00:59+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  3:00PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 3:01PM by James McMurray.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, now you're swqitching from "it just ain't possible with torturing someone" to "there's no rewards in it for me."

There might have been NPCs that approved or disapproved of his decision and consequences based on that approval in their relationship with him, but I don't think that's the same thing, is it?<br><br>Alignment shift is another question, but suffice to say that the rules about it require a lot more than a single choice in a single dilemma, so, following the rules, I did not shift his alignment.<br><br>I think there may be some difference in our play experience because my primary D&amp;D play experience is with Third Edition while Gygax' book, clearly, uses the assumptions of earlier editions in which a lot more of the game was freeform (social interactions, worldbuilding, etc.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91451/#Comment_91451" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T18:08:19+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  6:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>Ah, now you're switching from "it just ain't possible with torturing someone" to "there's no rewards in it for me."

Maybe this is indeed limited to my personal experiences, but judging by the amount of people I've heard and message board posts I've seen that boil down to <i>waah waah, my players are unsophisticated morons who don't understand the finer points of personal sacrifice and moral dilemmas, all they wanna do is level up and get ph4t l3wt omg what am I gonna do????</i>, I'd say it's more than just me.<br><br>Let me make one more observation.

As such, it's not a D&amp;D specific problem, or even universal within D&amp;D play. Really good, socially adept DMs will certainly make accommodations to ensure all players are enjoying themselves regardless of what playstyle is used.<br><br>However, I find that certain ideas (which I call "misconceptions") within D&amp;D allow DMs to abuse the players. One of these ideas is the idea that players should slavishly follow their Alignment, that Alignments have absolute rules associated with them, and that players who do not follow those rules should be punished. For example, a Paladin must remain Lawful Good to retain hir God-given powers and LG characters must follow rules X, Y and Z. A DM wishing to centre play around moral dilemmas, perhaps in order to tell some Epic Story, might put said Pally in a position where SHe is forced to choose between adhering to secular law or divine law. If SHe chooses "wrong" according to the DM's definition, the Pally loses hir powers and becomes some crippled Fighter-class. Whoop-de-do, how cool. We truly are great Artistes now.<br><br>If this is what the player <i>asked</i> for, awesome. If it's not explicitly stated, the player's probably not overjoyed by having hir hockey stick removed in the middle of the game and replaced with a broom handle based on the result of some arbitrary ruling. Even if it is explicitly stated, in most cases I can't really comprehend why that player wouldn't play a game that drives towards and rewards playing out those issues if that is what interests hir, but that's a system preference issue which does not really concern me.\n<blockquote>Why on earth did you (for example) choose to play a Lawful good priest of a forest goddess if you didn't want to use those facets in your fun-inducing dramatic story?</blockquote>\nOh no, see, I <i>did</i> want to use them. I just didn't make my choice with the idea I'd be writing a blank cheque to the DM to use my choices against me. They're tools I wanted to play with, I never said I wanted them to restrict my choices of action. The D&amp;D Alignment rules are notorious for enforcing such restrictions, encompassing every moral compass from Righteous Holy Man to Demon Spawn from Hell into nine "neat" categories. What Gygax made "click" for me was that these categories aren't meant to be interpreted, defined and enforced by the DM or even play group - they're there for the <i>player's</i> benefit.\n<blockquote>You're giving a lot of personal opinions and misconceptions, then labelling them "official."</blockquote>\nCan you please give me your idea of the "official" description of D&amp;D as a game, James? Or is D&amp;D such a great, wondrous, nebulous game that it has no meaning, form or shape until it gets defined by its users?<br/><br/>Jason, I've tried as hard as I can and I can't fathom how you could get that from my example. Let me clarify a couple of things:<br/><br/>1. It's a fictional example. Nobody has ever run this, least of all me.<br/>2. In the example, the players played the way they did because they felt compelled to do it, not because they greatly enjoyed acting in-character. As you'll note, the first example has them acting in-character as well. In case this has been lost in translation somewhere, all my statements and examples has been in the context of some players unnecessarily restricting their character's actions against their will. Nothing I've said here applies if everyone is dancing on pink clouds from joy.<br/>3. Re: insta-kill - are you saying that if they chose to play their alignments to the hilt as in the example, fucked up their combat because of it, and the game rules determined they all got slaughtered by the monsters... the DM should fudge the results to allow them to live to reward them for their good roleplaying? Just checking.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91452/#Comment_91452" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T18:11:07+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  6:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People, I don't know how you see this one-sided conversation from the fighting line, knife between the teeth, in full warrior fury to defend the honour of a game, but I am tell you what I am seeing from the gallery.<br/><br/>I am seeing Mikael tring to explain estabilished gaming theory (remember, "estabished" doen't mean "never challenged" or "proved", but mean something that got debated, tested, challenged  for YEARS, and it's still standing) and some really basilar concepts like reward cycles to some people who think that a "debate" mean sneering, snikers, personal attacks and worn-out inanities like "you must have had the wrong DM"<br/><br/>James, Jason:  how do you think you are coming out, with this childish behaviour?

I feel like we're saying a really non-controversial thing here.  Different roleplaying games are better for different things.  If you want to play out a strategic combat, don't use Bachannal.  There aren't any rules for it.  Sure, you can have a strategic combat happen in a game of Bachannal, but for a lot of players it's going to be pretty unsatisfying, and it's clearly not going to be strategic.  You should play D&amp;D.  It has rules for strategic combat.  It's a more satisfying game for that goal, because you'll be interacting with the rules of the game.  Similarly, if you want to play a game about making tough choices between what your character believes, and what your character wants, don't use D&amp;D.  There aren't any rules for it.  Sure, you can have a character make those tough choices in the game, but it's not as satisfying as, say, Burning Wheel, where those choices have a significant mechanical impact on your character, and you're never punished for a choice (by being denied XP).<br><br/>I'd go so far as to say that D&amp;D allows a much wider range of play styles better than a lot of "narrow-focus" indie games, but that's not the same as saying it "supports" those styles of play. <br/><br/>If you're on board with "system matters", I can't understand how this is a controversial issue.  If you're not on board with "system matters", then I don't think this thread is going to convince you, and I'd wonder why you'd choose this thread in which to discuss it.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91567/#Comment_91567" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T07:11:03+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  7:11AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Lucas</cite>In 2nd Edition, I'm almost positive you lost a level if you changed alignments.  I don't recall if that was true in 1st edition or Basic.  I know it's not true in 3.x, where nothing happens (unless you're a paladin or radically change your cleric's alignment).</blockquote>\n(Hi Dave!)<br/><br/>You're absolutely right - according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29" rel="nofollow">Tome of Unquestionably Accurate (and Fully Quotable in Thesis Projects) Knowledge</a>, AD&amp;D did indeed penalize Alignment conflicts mechanically:\n<blockquote>Under the AD&amp;D rules, a player character's alignment was strongly enforced. For example, under 2nd Edition AD&amp;D rules, a character who performed too many actions outside of his alignment could be forced to change alignment, and alignment changes were penalized by requiring more experience to be gained to reach the next level.</blockquote>\nwhile this changed as of 3e:\n<blockquote> In third edition D&amp;D this restriction is removed and players are technically allowed to change alignment freely.</blockquote>\n(Note it says "players" are allowed to change alignment freely. I wonder if that is accurate or if that also implies that other players - for example, the DM - can force an Alignment change for your character. This is a really important detail.)<br/><br/>I also note that this gem, from an ENworld Q&amp;A session with Mr. Gygax in 2004, would imply that he's either incoherent or has changed his mind on the subject since he wrote "Roleplaying Mastery":\n<blockquote>The paladin is modeled on the medieval paladins of Charlemagne, and they were surely a conflicted lot. <b>What is and isn't chivalrous and honorable is up to the DM</b>, but slaughtering baby orcs isn't likely to fall into either class. Slaughtering adult orcs converted to Lawful Good is likely acceptable, as it sends them on to a better reward, prevents them from backsliding to evil ways.</blockquote>\n[emphasis added]<br/><br/>So, yeah, bleaugh. Whatever. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks for clarifying that, Dave.                        </div>\n<div

It seems to me that statements like that are meant to refer to D&amp;D, not some bad GMs you've met.

There are some roleplayers in the world who aren't very nice people. They use the game to elevate themselves socially above others in their group due to some sort of deep rooted self esteem issues. If they were playing hockey or participated in a bible study group they'd do the same thing via different means. I attack them.<br/><br/>But more importantly, I attack the <i>notions</i> which some of these people have spread around by preaching their dysfunctional playstyle, that ruins the game for unsuspecting bystanders who aren't necessarily interested at all in being abusive or controlling. This playstyle boils down to penalizing players for their choices in the guise of enforcing "good roleplay". DMs and players that subscribe to this playstyle will often put themselves or others in situations where they are forced to choose, not between great and awesome, but between bad and worse - or they will try to, and then rant and rave at their unsophisticated players for dodging their attempts.<br/><br/>My mitigating point is that they may be aiming for a style of play that is not fun to play using the mechanics of D&amp;D, play which would be far more fun using a system which provided a reward for it in some way. They set out with the best of intentions and when the system lets them down (because they asked a soda machine to give them a hamburger, not because D&amp;D is "broken" in any way) they blame their players, because this is what they've been told to do.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why we're arguing whether or not it's abusive of a DM to force the players to dance like a monkey against their will by challenging their intelligence. <br/>This is all pretty straightforward in my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91579/#Comment_91579" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T07:44:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  7:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Simon!<br/><br/>Yes, I think you nailed it.

Do you mean that they felt their characters would not launch into battle, or that they were afraid of DM-enacted repercussions?

I thought that was not only arbitrary, but unlikely.  You suggested that people would die because one player tried to strictly play his alignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou admitted that the theoretical fighters would have been foolish to proceed the way they did, and real players wouldn't have proceeded as recklessly.  After the fight got underway, while it's true that the players would be initially at a disadvantage, there are many possible outcomes.  They aren't any more likely to lose because of this pre-fight roleplay than because somebody rolled three "1"'s in a row.  Their still-normal chances for survival would have nothing to do with DM fudging.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, since you insisted that the players would end up dead because they were not playing the game in adherence with your interpretation of the rules, it came off to me like a punitive DM kill, which I found funny, in the context of abusive DMing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91589/#Comment_91589" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T07:55:03+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  7:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sheesh, what a dumbass.

System Matters because D&amp;D (like all games) does not facilitate certain modes of play. Enforcing modes of play that aren't fun, by challenging your fellow players' choices in the game and threatening to remove their tools of play, is abusive. A certain interpretation of how to handle Alignment (for example) in D&amp;D lends itself especially well to this abusive mode of play. My original comment was with regards to Gygax' statement that Alignment was a tool for the player, not a "flaw" which restricts their actions, and certainly not a mallet for the DM to smack them with.<br><br>There's the connection between abusive players and System Matters.<br><br>EDIT:\n<blockquote>It's an argument using 'system matters' as a tool to unload hatred towards DMs.</blockquote>\nFuck no. As I mentioned above, I was the one who used this shit-poor attitude against my DM in one of my previous experiences, by insisting the game be about something the system didn't facilitate and which I believe the DM - who was very experienced - knew implicitly would not be fun for the players.<br><br>Yes, DMs are usually the ones ranting and raving about their players rather than the other way around, which is why this is the example I've used most. DMs also have the power to attempt to enforce such play on their players, a power the D&amp;D system does not mechanically provide to players. But as I've demonstrated, it could just as well be an ass of a player trying to enforce "good roleplaying" around the table leading to fucking misery.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91623/#Comment_91623" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T08:24:56+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And to all - if the "GM as god" construction was so pernicious, why did it survive so long and produce so much interesting and wonderful play for so many highly diverse groups?

I only mentioned "GM is God" as being an aspect that contributes to the misconception that it's somehow the D&amp;D DM's job to artificially make the game about deeper issues than killing monsters and leveling up. "GM is God" has many awesome effects, one of which is a potentially very consistent, intriguing and powerful storyline.

My basic statement was that <i>all</i> the players tries to strictly play their alignment and in doing so, avoids the rules and fun which D&amp;D explicitly sets forth in favour of mechanically unassisted artsy-fartsy lala-land. This causes the players to perform sub-optimal in the game of D&amp;D tactical combat and thus might prevent them from getting cool stuff and enjoy the game with the mechanics D&amp;D provides.

Indy games that systemize story elements are exciting new additions to the industry.  But the reason that they exist is because thousands of players were turning their D&amp;D campaigns into story games, with varying success.  Since the rules of D&amp;D don't incorporate explicit story elements into the tactical game, some smart designers decided that they should create system-fueled story games.<br><br>I know these ideas have been debated at length, and the consensus is that it is foolish to inject story into a tactical combat game.  But, has much thought has gone into figuring out why people gravitate towards story-izing D&amp;D?  And why it seems to work for many groups?  <br><br>In the context of the system matters argument- One side promotes the notion that storyfiying D&amp;D only works because "you've got a great DM".   The other side promotes the notion that system doesn't matter because "you don't have the right DM". These statements are <b>equally dismissive</b>.<br><br>When thousands of gamers come up with the same playstyle, after reading the same rulebook, I don't think that "artificially" is the appropriate adjective.  "Organically" seems more apt.  The indy mindset seems to dismiss the whole idea as laughably trying to make monopoly into an improv game.   This opinion invalidates the enjoyment that MOST gamers get from their story-driven play experience (this is assuming that at least a slight majority of gamers enjoy playing their weekly games).  Additionally, this opinion does nothing to explain why so many people do it and like it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91650/#Comment_91650" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T09:05:55+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  9:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, you're reading far more into my posts than what I'm actually saying.<br/><br/>If you use the word "organically" you're stating that the entire group is on the same page and organically creates an awesome story using D&amp;D's combat-oriented and task-based conflict resolution system as an engine. This is absolutely possible! Lots of awesome stories have prominent combat scenes, difficult challenges and personal growth.<br/><br/>I use the word "artificially" to describe the opposite situation - your group is not all on the same page, probably because you've played together less than 100 hours or so, you may not be great friends outside of the game, or into the same popular media. You were all brought together by the game of D&amp;D, which is a game that mostly provides rules for strategic combat. So the only thing you really have in common is the fact that you want to play a game of strategic combat.<br/><br/>NO DM IN HISTORY is going to make the latter group tell an awesome heroic story, but the latter group can still have fun together. If the DM insists on trying to make the game into something it is currently not, which a huge number of people seem to think hir role is, SHe risks whatever it is we're talking about in this thread.<br/><br/>So yes, I too dismiss the notion that you can storify D&amp;D if you have a great DM. You can only storify D&amp;D, in my experience, if everyone in your group is on the exact same page with regards to what story you want to tell - or leave story entirely up to the DM to handle while they fight through the DM's challenges.<br/><br/>Lastly, this is certainly not in any way about indy vs trad. It's about how in my experience and opinion D&amp;D does not work well when people try to introduce elements which other games handle well, much like other games may not do great with D&amp;D's tactical combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91651/#Comment_91651" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T09:06:23+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  9:06AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Who does<i>not</i>have a horrible time when being punished?

Punishment is something implicit in every game mechanic where there is a potential for loss.  If there is a potential for reward (as opposed to an automatic reward), then there is a potential for "punishment".  If I move away from an enemy in D&amp;D, I am punished because he gets an attack of opportunity on me.  If I happen to move between 2 enemies, the system punishes me with a mechanical disadvantage by giving them a +2 to hit.  Isn't it my right as a player to choose to get in between 2 enemies if I feel like it?  If i have the potential for rolling a vorpal blade on the treasure table, and I roll badly, I am punished for rolling badly by only getting a crappy potion of healing.

The question of the level of "varying success" that people have had using D&amp;D to do this sort of thing is moot. The problem is not with using D&amp;D as a story-game. If that's what a group wants, then great. It's when, for whater reason, the phenomenon rears it's head where a GM will set up situations in which players have to choose between disappointing some participants playing (including themselves) because they've not played well tactically, or choosing to dissapoint some participants because you're not playing your character well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll give a hyphothetical actual play example that is, while fictional, representative of actual experiences that I've had with D&amp;D (forgive me if I can't recall precise details from a game I haven't played much in 25 years). The PC Party is a Lawful Good Paladin, and a Chaotic Neutral thief. They are partnered precisely because the AD&amp;D1E text says:<br/>\n1. Each player rolls up a character.<br/>\n2. Then all the players together are a party.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the party comes across some poor folks, but steals their last morsels of food, because, after all, the mechanics give him a roll regarding this, and his rationale is that this is what a Chaotic Neutral character would do. Later the Paladin becomes aware of this having happened, the GM manipulating events to make this informaton come to light. And he implies that if the Paladin doesn't do something about this transgression that he'll get some penalty (maybe it's only a suggestion that he's on the road to alignment change or something, with the potential eventual loss of his paladin powerz). The thief player decides to refuse to cooperate with the Paladin's reasonable request to return the stolen items. Heck, he doesn't want his alignment changing so that he can't reasonably use his theif powers on whoever he comes across!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the options of the player of the Paladin? <br/>\nA) Let the theif get away with it. Everyone is disappointed because the Paladin acted out of character. Especially disappointing to the player of the Paladin, because he really wanted to play the character as being unflaggingly for good. <br/>\nB) Attack the thief to get the stuff back. In AD&amp;D1E, this would be the player's only option - there weren't any social skills or anything back then. In fact, if it's BD&amp;D or earlier, there aren't even any rules to attack to subdue. The only way to overpower somebody is to kill them, or get them to surrender. This is dissapointing to both players because the result will be one or more wounded or dead characters, which is a waste of tactical resources. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow perhaps there's a third option here of some sort, but in actual play in situations like this, these are the only two options I've ever seen anyone take. And I've seen both of them taken. And the choice made actually has far less to do with tactical sensibilies or such than with the metagamed arguments that players will make around the subject as it's about to happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as Mikail says, one doesn't have to set up such situations at all. It's not that D&amp;D can't be played to one or the other of these modes where all of the players will be satisfied, because they understand that this is what the play is about. The problem is that the GM is implying by his play that both modes are important, such that either decision will be a disappointment. It's the fault of Gygax's advice that's being referred to that somebody might do this. Actually I think that it's also implicit in his text, because I never read his book, but still ended up being that GM. And I wondered why people would get so upset when things like this happened. Actually I could feel the problem instinctively once we'd get into such a situation, but it wouldn't be for two decades before I really understood what had gone wrong here. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yeah, I know that this "accidental torture" occurs, because I can give you a recollection of me doing it. I hated it when it happened, but just didn't know how to get "story" out of D&amp;D otherwise. It's not about "bad" DMs... it's about DMs trying to do something with a system that it isn't well-designed to do... something of which they are simply unaware. Sure there are probably some DMs who figured this out and had good work arounds. But I'm a reasonably good GM, and I fell into the trap. So it's not just a matter of this being a railing against bad DMs. In fact, I've also given examples of me doing it as a player, too, so it's not about DMs at all, or bad players, but just a pitfall. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with Gygax's idea being discussed is that it promotes thinking that leads you right into that pitfall. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91673/#Comment_91673" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T09:44:19+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  9:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Attack the thief to get the stuff back.

I've posted a couple of his ideas in here by now, and they contradict each other.<br/><br/>The first idea I presented was one that I enjoyed and which I thought defused the danger: not to overplay the importance of things like Alignments, treat them as guiding tools for the players to maintain an internal consistency and compass for their character. To recognize what the core of the game is about and play to that, without getting tied up in stuff that ultimately has little or no bearing on the system as offered.<br/><br/>The second idea, which he posted on ENworld Q&amp;A and which apparently appears in the AD&amp;D text, is that Alignments have hard and fast rules associated with them and players who do not "follow" their Alignments should be punished. A Paladin should forcibly convert the Chaotic Evil Orc to Lawful Neutral, then slaughter it to give peace to its soul before the Orc's nature causes it to plummet back into the Abyss. If the Paladin's player doesn't do the above, then the DM has the right to take away his powers.<br/><br/>I suspect you mean the second?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91684/#Comment_91684" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T10:04:13+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:04AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>You can only storify D&amp;D, in my experience, if everyone in your group is on the exact same page with regards to what story you want to tell - or leave story entirely up to the DM to handle while they fight through the DM's challenges.</blockquote>\nThe latter is what the rules of Third Edition say is the standard mode of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91685/#Comment_91685" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T10:05:20+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>This is where you lose me.

Since that's not what we want our game to be about, we need to have one or both concepts change."<br/><br/>The first question before starting any RPG, heck, any game, should be with "is this the (style of) game we all want to play?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91688/#Comment_91688" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T10:07:02+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:07AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 10:17AM by jzn.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Mike's defense, I do think that, often, PC paladins would either let the thief get away with it or attack him.  Often, at least, in middle school.<br/><br/>See, that's what happens if the players can't cooperate in the metagame.  If they have any sense of collaboration, what will happen is that the paladin will threaten to attack the thief, and the thief will either give in, or trick the pally in some way.  This resolution satisfies everybody's characterization urges, and is the one I see most often in my gameplay, much more often than pvp killing.<br/><br/>Mike is still arguing that using D&amp;D as a story game is a choice made by some groups.

The BW reward system very clearly intends for this to happen and will reward the player either way. The game isn't about stepping on other players' toes to disempower them, it's about challenging them in order to transform and empower them.<br/><br/>D&amp;D play - and let me add <i>as described and implied by the official core texts of 3e</i> - centres around empowerment by completing challenges external to your character while reinforcing and fulfilling your character's persona. It's not a game that's about tough choices and personal transformation, because the game system explicitly disempowers you when you engage in such play.<br/><br/>Edit to add: Of course, as you say, if you enjoy a playstyle where your character goes through personal crises and perhaps transformation, in spite of - or challenged by - the mechanical disadvantages, and you really really really want to do it with d20, I'm not here to judge your fun. It's the idea that this is a superior playstyle and of course it can be applied to D&amp;D which irks me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91695/#Comment_91695" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T10:19:24+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:19AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 10:20AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited to note the crosspost, which is hugely significant here.]<br/>\n<br/>\nJD, I'd agree that later editions of D&amp;D were much better at being clear about what the game supports. Recall that the thread is about a book that Gygax wrote well before those editions, and notions of play that occured from earlier editions, which weren't so clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nMikhael, yes, the second notion. It's that which leads into this whole part of the thread, no? <br/>\n<br/>\nJames, I refer you in answer to Mikael's post. But it may interest you to know that, when playing in 1979, that, in fact, no, we [b]never, ever, spoke in character.[/b] There was no text that indicated we should in the editions we played, and no examples of it in the books. The first editions of D&amp;D say "Rules for Miniatures Warfare" on the covers. They were wargames. Gygax, to his credit, was enumerating a method of play that most of us had never heard of (well, had by the time he published the book). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that's not to say that we didn't say things like:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer A: My character shouts at you to give that stuff back. <br/>\nPlayer B: My character shouts even louder that he won't.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point is that the system is promoting neither of them giving in, in this case, and the "story" that's being created by this conflict - which is exactly the sort of thing that happens in every game I play lately, and is considered the height of fun - is actually causing the players to dislike each other because of the pressures that the system sets up. Not the fault of the system, it's the fault of the DM thinking that it won't be problematic to do this. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that players like this always got labeled as "munchkins" or "powergamers" because they didn't "get it." Well, they didn't "get it" because the system was informing them of a completely different direction of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91700/#Comment_91700" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T10:24:23+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to give a big fucking THANK YOU to everyone participating in this thread.<br/><br/>All the challenges are helping me verbalize exactly what I like and what I don't like about gaming, and I'm really stoked to finally figure this shit out.<br/><br/>I'm excited to play both D&amp;D and Burning Wheel now, and before this thread started I really didn't want to play either.<br/><br/>Thanks guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91702/#Comment_91702" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T10:25:06+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:25AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll add, too, note that, despite the improvement in the quality of the texts post 3rd ed, that the problem remains.

After a long, terrible, awful Fate point bidding war I finally gave in. It was hard, bloody hard, and I was not pleased at all that my character would now be forced to be entranced by that shithead (character, not player). I didn't feel de-protagonized exactly, but certainly bullied.<br/><br/>We came to the conclusion that in large part, this was due to a lack of system focus on such challenges. I didn't feel like I had many tools at my disposal to protect myself, not much of a "game" to play. It was a straight Rapport vs Resolve roll, some Fate points, and bam! A large chunk of my character's free will removed.<br/><br/>If we'd used the social conflict system instead, slowly wearing away at each other's social stress boxes, and eventually causing enough "damage" to have to take Consequences and eventually settle for a Compromise, I'd have been much happier.<br/><br/>Same in D&amp;D, frankly - I don't want someone to be able to mind control me with a Persuasion roll. If there's a system of social conflict that I can use to try to fight it off, as there would be if this was an integral and important part of the game design, suddenly it's far more interesting and no more deprotagonizing than any physical conflict would be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91710/#Comment_91710" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T10:44:47+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 10:46AM by jzn.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it's nice to read something we see eye to eye about, lachek!

The players are just play-acting or negotiating among themselves.  Which is fine but isn't an example of the system supporting the resolution of that type of conflict.  Burning Wheel on the other hand does (in fact, revolves around) this kind of conflict.  The players would simply engage in a Dual of Wits and the winner gets what he wants.  Play moves on.  Both players would likely gain rewards in terms of Artha for the conflict.<br/><br/>That's what Mikael is talking about when he says the system is supporting that kind of play.<br/><br/>D&amp;D doesn't support that stuff.  It doesn't hinder you from developing houserules or social resolutions for it but it doesn't actually support it as written.  When I play D&amp;D I actually allow Diplomacy and other social skills of the characters work in these situations and they get rolled.

I think they could definitely occur in a situation where the players are comfortable with each other and are well aware of the type of story they want to tell. Much like any free-form style of roleplaying, there are multiple unspoken rules that allow such situations to occur. For example, everyone needs to work towards a cooperative solution. Everyone needs to recognize the worth of the other characters to the party as a whole. The game is about resolving conflicts, not causing and escalating them. And so on.<br/><br/>If the parties fail to agree on any of these rules, and cannot seem to come to an easy solution using free-form play, they'll be re-evaluating their options and finding that the only mechanism they really have for enforcing their will is bashing skulls. I have seen this happen - hell, I don't think any roleplayer ever doesn't have a horror story to tell about how a party of five adventurers enter a dungeon but only one come out, covered with the brains of his compatriots. It's a gamer cliche, even.<br/><br/>But that's not even the point! Can free-form play address issues of enforcing Alignments in roleplay, even when they lead to conflicts? Yes, on occasion. Is it <b>fun</b>? <b>More</b> fun than bashing monsters and disarming trapped chests?

Burning Wheel on the other hand does (in fact, revolves around) this kind of conflict. The players would simply engage in a Dual of Wits and the winner gets what he wants. Play moves on. Both players would likely gain rewards in terms of Artha for the conflict.</blockquote>\nOf course that's the examples I used. It's the point I was trying to make! :-)\n<blockquote>That's what Mikael is talking about when he says the system is supporting that kind of play.</blockquote>\nI wasn't talking about that. I was replying to a specific, and to my mind ludicrous, example lachek gave.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>James, thanks for the examples. I think they could definitely occur in a situation where the players are comfortable with each other and are well aware of the type of story they want to tell. Much like any free-form style of roleplaying, there are multiple unspoken rules that allow such situations to occur. For example, everyone needs to work towards a cooperative solution. Everyone needs to recognize the worth of the other characters to the party as a whole. The game is about resolving conflicts, not causing and escalating them. And so on.<br/><br/>If the parties fail to agree on any of these rules, and cannot seem to come to an easy solution using free-form play, they'll be re-evaluating their options and finding that the only mechanism they really have for enforcing their will is bashing skulls. I have seen this happen - hell, I don't think any roleplayer ever doesn't have a horror story to tell about how a party of five adventurers enter a dungeon but only one come out, covered with the brains of his compatriots. It's a gamer cliche, even.</blockquote>\nYep, like I said (paraphrased), if the players suck at having group fun, the game will suck in the group fun department.\n<blockquote>But that's not even the point! Can free-form play address issues of enforcing Alignments in roleplay, even when they lead to conflicts? Yes, on occasion. Is it<b>fun</b>?<b>More</b>fun than bashing monsters and disarming trapped chests? That's strictly a matter of taste, and the D&amp;D (3e) rules do very little to suggest that such play is necessary at all.

Which can work, often doesn't, and rarely leads to a higher degree of fun than if you just played the game as written without trying to impose your own personal ideas of what "roleplaying" is all "about". That's not to say you can't act your character, just that it isn't the focus of the game of D&amp;D, nor the integral component of why the game is fun to play.<br/><br/>Edit to clarify: What I mean is, if you're having to mess up your character's groove in order to "roleplay" "properly", the game is less fun. Players who constrain their actions, or DMs that enforce such constraints, depending on Alignment etc are not playing the game in accordance with the way I perceive the game to have been designed to be enjoyed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91767/#Comment_91767" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:41:05+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:41AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>We came to the conclusion that in large part, this was due to a lack of system focus on such challenges. I didn't feel like I had many tools at my disposal to protect myself, not much of a "game" to play. It was a straight Rapport vs Resolve roll, some Fate points, and bam! A large chunk of my character's free will removed.<br/><br/>If we'd used the social conflict system instead, slowly wearing away at each other's social stress boxes, and eventually causing enough "damage" to have to take Consequences and eventually settle for a Compromise, I'd have been much happier.</blockquote>\nWould you really?  Going through some extra dice rolls and maneuvers would have made you feel better about another player having his character dictate what your character wants?  Because I don't much see the difference, other than BW allows for some shades of grey with Compromise, and that may not even be on the table.<br/><br/>And doing back to a previous post;\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Because play would then centre around the fulfillment or the transformation of those Beliefs. The BW reward system very clearly intends for this to happen and will reward the player either way. The game isn't about stepping on other players' toes to disempower them, it's about challenging them in order to transform and empower them.</blockquote>\nBut the desired range of fulfillment or transformation is going to vary.  Three players write down the belief "I am a stalwart defender of the good".  Player 1 may want his belief to be challenged, but also to ultimately prevail (or die trying).  He wants that belief to be ultimately be reinforced, and will not be happy if another player (or even the GM!) forces him to betray his principles.  Player 2's whole intent may have been to go down that other road, and will be disappointed if he can't get the drama of a fall from grace.  Player 3 may be open to either outcome.  Things will not work if the mix of player interests and/or character concepts are going to cause cross-purposes in the players agendas.<br/><br/>I do have some preferred play styles that are informing my thinking - I'm more interested in games where the players are a team facing external threats and challenges.  There can be some internecine conflict, but ultimately, it's a band of brothers and sisters, whether they're a mob gang rubbing out the competition, or heroes defeating the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>Going back to the seduction scenario: how would you have felt if it was an NPC seducing your character?  Because I think there's a different feel to the GM applying pressure and another character doing so.  Since the GM plays multiple characters, there's less identification of GM=seducer.  That seducing PC is going to be at the table next week, too, if the game continues.  Also, a paladin's fall from grace because of an NPC's plot seems less invasive than a fall form grace because another PC had a different agenda.  The GM is trying to show everyone a good time (theoretically), the other player may be just screwing with you, or placing his agenda above yours (again, assuming that level of inter-PC conflict wasn't part of the contract).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91779/#Comment_91779" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:51:43+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:51AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should try BW, and see what it does. It's not easy to see, but the reward mechanic makes a lot of difference here. That's not to say that you can't have such a problem in BW... I'm sure you can. I think it's just a bit less likely. But, for example, if you have people coming to BW from having played D&amp;D, and they espouse these play principles that we're finding problematic, yeah, you'll have the same problem in BW. Because, again, it's not the system that's problematic, but the Gygaxian principles of play in question that are causing the problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other problem is that we're getting bogged down in my example, and not getting at what it was pointing out.

The BW player would be wrong to put down a Belief he didn't want challenged, possibly transformed, in the same way the D&amp;D player would be wrong to be upset because his character met his doom deep down below water level. Far as I can see, Player 3 is the only one playing BW as written. Someone quote the book if I'm fux0r3d on that one, I don't have it with me.<br/><br/>As for the seduction gig, I'll tell you if it comes up again, but my gut feeling after having run through it a few million times in my head and with friends is that I'd have been perfectly happy if my character had met her fate as a result of my honest exhausting of all the intricate resources the system supplied me with. A simple opposed skill roll felt far too petty to have caused such a major disruption to her life, even if she did get a chance to dump some Fate points into it. After a full-fledged social combat, possibly resulting in fallout and maybe even a compromise (yes, SotC has Compromise rules too), I think I would have been content to accept that my character thought that dude was pretty hot stuff.<br/><br/>I do think you're right about the distinction between PC and NPC, but I also think it's a red herring in the current line of discussion, perhaps worthy of a new thread.<br/><br/>Edit to add: It may be worth noting that Spirit of the Century allows the winner of a conflict to dictate <i>anything they want</i> to happen to the defeated character. In the case of physical conflicts, this may be "I kill him" or "I imprison him" or "I give him a wedgie and send him on his way" (though the last one would more likely be a Compromise). It is in this light that I figure that, if in a physical conflict my opponent would have 100% control of my character's fate if they win, in a social conflict the same argument should stand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91789/#Comment_91789" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T12:03:22+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 12:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm too used to my main social forum, where thread topic is just a mild suggestion!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91792/#Comment_91792" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T12:08:19+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 12:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we're all providing Thoughts still, aren't we?

If instead what you're saying is that all PCs should be able to do whatever they want with no in game consequences, all I can say to that is: snicker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91807/#Comment_91807" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T12:32:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 12:32PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite><br/>Edit to add: It may be worth noting that Spirit of the Century allows the winner of a conflict to dictate<i>anything they want</i>to happen to the defeated character. In the case of physical conflicts, this may be "I kill him" or "I imprison him" or "I give him a wedgie and send him on his way" (though the last one would more likely be a Compromise). It is in this light that I figure that, if in a physical conflict my opponent would have 100% control of my character's fate if they win, in a social conflict the same argument should stand.</blockquote>\nI'd like to add: read the evilhat wiki about spicing up the combats <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Some options (valid for social AND phisical combat):<br/><br/>- Maneuver, don't just roll for attack and defence.

I'll avoid imposing my will on those folks, if you don't mind. :-) You're going much deeper than "game where you play a role," which is what I said.\n<blockquote>In the first iterations of D&amp;D, as well as all computer RPGs, it means only a). Period.</blockquote>\nSource? And by source I mean the game itself, not Gygax's later compilation of his thoughts, especially considering Gygax was but one of the many cogs in a large D&amp;D creation machine.\n<blockquote>What's your definition?</blockquote>\nMy definition is "game where you play a role." Anything beyond that is stepping outside of definitions and into motives or methods.\n<blockquote>As far as other rules you've added, I listed a few off above - ensure everyone works together towards a resolution, not an escalation, of intra-party conflicts, for example.</blockquote>\nThat's not a rule of a game, that's a precept for worthwhile social situation for almost any setup which isn't explicitly looking for interpersonal conflict. If you need a game to tell you not to be a dick to those around you, I think I may have just discovered another explanation for those social problems you were talking about earlier.\n<blockquote>This goes completely contrary to, for example, Dogs in the Vineyard where the point of the GM is to escalate conflicts.

I think you're missing my point entirely. There are absolutely no game system rules involved in a freeform resolution of the aforementioned paladin and rogue's in game scenario. You don't need to add them. You don't need to enforce them. All you do is roleplay the situations to their outcomes. If the group is such (as your hypothetical one appears to be) that they don't want fights between the PCs, it's encumbent upon the group, not the system, to make sure those fights don't happen.\n<blockquote>As for what makes D&amp;D fun, if you derive fun from the rules you added (or your internalized ideas of what "roleplaying" is) rather than the rules in the text, I'm happy for you.</blockquote>\nOops! There goes the snicker! :-) <br/><br/>Obviously you can't listen and/or I can't explain, as the things I'm saying are completely different from the things you're telling me I'm saying.

While it's possible for a game to have rules that control PC behavior, it's completely unnecessary. If you don't have the underlying agreement to not be dicks, rules put in place to try to stop you from being a dick can be viewed as obstacles to be worked around or overcome. Or in other words, systemic rules for social interaction are useless because they themselves require you to agree to a social contract that accepts those rules. If you're willing to make the underlying agreement, the rules-based agreement is unnecessary. If you're not willing to make the underlying agreement, the rules are useless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91838/#Comment_91838" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T13:36:43+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  1:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you saying that rules that inform what we play about are pointless?

That's it, just the normal social convention of cooperation.  Lachek is saying the same thing, except he is saying you need to "bring it in as a house rule", which, while true, is a bit misleading because cooperation is often implicit in a social team situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91846/#Comment_91846" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T13:52:02+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  1:52PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, you assume correctly, although I didn't think to name it as a principle since it seemed, well, obvious to me.<br>James, apologies if it wasn't clear enough that that's what I meant.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>That's not a rule of a game, that's a precept for worthwhile social situation for almost any setup which isn't explicitly looking for interpersonal conflict. If you need a game to tell you not to be a dick to those around you, I think I may have just discovered another explanation for those social problems you were talking about earlier.</blockquote>\nAs I mentioned, a different roleplaying game - Dogs in the Vineyard - explicitly urge that conflicts should be escalated whenever possible. If someone takes a "solve the problem and smooth out the situation at any cost" metagame approach in Dogs, SHe is being a dick to the other players. Since D&amp;D doesn't state anywhere that working together as a team is the "correct mode of play", many perfectly reasonable, non-dickish people enter into the game thinking that they should try to swipe all the loot because they're a rogue, or never back down from a challenge because they're a barbarian.<br><br>As you may recall, this whole discussion came aflame when I pointed out that Gygax solved this problem for me by saying "Hey! You don't actually have to be a pawn to your alignment if it's bad for the game!" You think people can play their Alignment to the hilt while maximizing fun? So do I! Assuming they are accountable <i>only to themselves</i>. The moment they have to justify their actions to someone else with a different idea of how they "should" be playing, especially if that person wields the Rod of Penalty, their fun will suffer. Thankfully, D&amp;D as a ruleset isn't built to deal with things where deep characterization would be useful, like dramas, horror or epic intrigue. Thus, most people won't try to play those types of stories and won't fall into the trap of bullying other players into acting the way they feel like they should act rather than the way they want to act.<br/><br/>As for the source to the statement that early iterations of D&amp;D were no more immersive roleplaying experiences than playing Warhammer 40K with only one fig per person, I'm going to have to leave that as an exercise for the reader - because frankly, that's such a well-known fact that:<br/>a) Since it's not a matter of contention, it's moderately hard to find sources claiming either it or the contrary, and<br/>b) I just can't be bothered proving it for the benefit of the few that somehow missed it.<br/><br/>Listen, James, are you bored yet? Because I'm getting there, and I don't want to keep you up.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91847/#Comment_91847" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T13:53:36+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  1:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Are you saying that rules that inform what we play about are pointless?

And they're only pointless when the underlying social contract that allows them to work doesn't exist.\n<blockquote>If we're not being asses (everyone agrees about this point, BTW), then what are the rules for, precisely? If they're not about deciding which participant is right and wrong, what do they do?

Which is why I'm saying that, in this particular instance, the force that stops one player from interfering with everyone else's fun because he needs to steal a poor man's last food and then get into a fight with the paladin about it should be an internal one. Best case scenario the problem never arises. Next best case scenario, once it crops up, the two players should find an in character means of solving the dispute that doesn't involve getting into a fight (unless, of course, they're looking to a duel).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91848/#Comment_91848" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T13:53:44+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  1:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 3:40PM by chearns.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>I am completely unfamiliar with the Lumpley Principal.

For example, in older D&amp;D (the ones I'm familiar with) there are no rules regarding what to do if two characters get into a disagreement regarding what to do with stolen goods (the paladin/thief example from earlier). Any resolution of that conflict other than I kill the other guy using the combat rules and return the stuff (or keep the stuff, but honestly, what are the odds that the thief wins a one on one combat with a paladin?) has to resort to some other rule in order to get resolved. And yes, that rule might very well be: let's play nice so that the game doesn't splinter apart.

There is a carrot associated with furthering your own goals over the party's. The characters team up only for the purpose of efficiency as far as the rule system is concerned. I understand completely why not everyone gets that cooperation is the One True Way of playing under those conditions.<br/><br/>And worse, the kind of player I've been discussing all along who think the purpose of the game is Highe Arte will wield a stick against those who do not act as an individual first, group second. Many consider it "good roleplay" for a Paladin to slaughter the orc tribe the party's Half-Orc Barbarian used to call home regardless of the party strife this would cause. Others call it "good roleplay" for a Paladin to not join forces with the rest of the party against a corrupt king, because well, the king is the Law. Yet others would have the Paladin arrest the Chaotic Good Ranger for stealing food to give to the poor.

As such, yes, I think the GM should punish (since he has to play the part of the gods). However, I also think that a few things should be made clear early on and as things progress:<br/><br/>1) What is unacceptable behavior?<br/><br/>2) How much unacceptable behavior must happen to be considered "sustained"?<br/><br/>3) What are the punishments? i.e. do we jump straight to loss of powers or is there a slow slide into darkness?<br/><br/>These can either be talked about in advance or revealed as the game progresses. If you don't know them well, responding to the proposed action with "that will probably go against your god's tenets" is probably best. If you know them well, then use whatever level of subtlty is appropriated so long as the player knows what's up.<br/><br/>But in no way should the paladin's powers be stripped with no warning because the GM is feeling feisty.<br/><br/>The part about how it makes D&amp;D a better game is very subjective. Personally I'm not a big fan of paladins. I like playing good guys with faults, not Righteous Warriors for Law and Good. But for those that enjoy them, the mechanics behind them can either be superflkuous (they were going to follow the code anyway) or give in-game flavor to the moral struggles they want to portray. I'm sure there are other ways it makes the game good, but like I said, I'm not a paladin type of guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91876/#Comment_91876" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T15:02:24+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  3:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 3:40PM by chearns.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Are you saying that rules that inform what we play about are pointless?

"Metagame rape". Awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the GM of the game in question, I will have you know I allow no rape, metagame or otherwise.  However, I do sometimes forget whole subsystems of rules exist and neglect to mention them to my players when we should all really be remembering them, such as the Conflict rules in Spirit of the Century.  I'm notorious that way.    :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm just going to bust in here with a related thing that is not directly addressing Mikael and other's current conversation, and hope people don't get pissed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that the word "rape" should be used in response to Mikael's example from our game.  And I can actually tie it into alignment in D&amp;D, which seems to be a lot about what this thread is about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a continuum of what is considered by players in any game to be their "territory" regarding their character.  Typically, people would probably rank things in roughly this order, from least contentious to most:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Character's passive behaviour (i.e. when the Ogre bashes me, do I get thrown backwards or stand my ground?)<br/>\n2) Character's active behaviour (i.e. when I bash the Ogre, do I do it in a flashy way, spinning around, or do i two hand over head whack him?)<br/>\n3) Character's speech (i.e. does my character say "Have at you, ogre!" or simply grit his teeth?)<br/>\n4) Character's observable emotion (i.e. Does my character look afraid, or angry, at the ogre?)<br/>\n5) Character's internal emotions (i.e. IS my character really afriad of the ogre, or not?)<br/>\n6) Character's internal beliefs (i.e. Does my character hate ogres?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not a complete list, but it will serve.  Think about the following sets of conflict goals I might have, from my opponent, the barmaid's, perspective:<br/>\n<br/>\n* I kiss the barmaid (level 1)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid to kiss me (level 2)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid to tell me she loves me (level 3)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid all flustered with my flirtation (level 4)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid to fall in love with me (level 5)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid to feel I am the only one in the world for her (level 6)<br/>\n<br/>\nYour level of comfort with the above goals will give you an insight into where you draw the line.  Personally, I don't draw any lines on the table above; as far as I am concerned, anything is fair game as long as I have some mechanics by which I can fight for control.  But not everybody feels that way.   Outside of a forum such as this, my experience tells me that it is FAR more common for players to draw the line somewhere between 2 and 3; in other words, it is completely unacceptable for another player to dictate to them on levels 3-6, even if there are rules to allow for it.   To a person who sets the line above level 5, what happened to Mikael would be described as a kind of rape; they were forced to acknowlege something they didn't want to on a level that should have been out of bounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, D&amp;D really has no rules (barring mechanical mind control through magic) for affecting any of 3-6, at least between players.  It's not clear to me whether Diplomacy and Intimidate are intended or in practice used on other PC's, I would have to read the rules again to be sure, but I think not.  This is on purpose.  D&amp;D is simply not about those levels.  Those levels are left completely within the hands of the DM and the players to resolve through conversation and negotiation.  Usually, this means that they are simply off limits, and a player has sole authority over these levels for his character; perfect for those that draw the line between 2 and 3.  With one BIG exception...alignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith alignment, a DM can go straight to any level, including level 6, and essentially dictate to the player what the character does/feels/believes.  This, too, is not a problem.  It is, in fact, the way the game is meant to work.  It is a FEATURE of D&amp;D, and even a necessary feature.  The alignment restrictions on those characters that have them (Paladins, Barbarians, Clerics) are both a kind of cost to allow those classes to have some more abilities than other, non-restricted classes, and are also mechanically necessary to determine the kinds of spells/powers the character has access to.  It also helps to enforce the "us good guys against EVIL!" vibe that really makes D&amp;D work well, as Gygax seems to be saying.  It is, in fact, the principle feature that allows groups of players all over the world to play story focused D&amp;D, because it gives the DM ultimate authority over all levels of character "territory" above.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice, however, the real problem is that this confrontation over alignment almost always happens DURING PLAY, and often comes out of the blue.  Frankly, the little blurbs in the Player's Handbook simply aren't enough.  Its not a problem that the DM thinks that the lawful good paladin needs to stop that thieving rogue.  It IS a problem that the DM springs it on that player in that exact moment, without any prior discussion.  It is a problem if the player was under the mistaken impression that levels 3-6 were off limits, and then suddenly is confronted by the fact that, at least in this one area, they are not, and in fact are subject to DM fiat decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere.  I don't think that was TOO far off topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91902/#Comment_91902" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T16:01:37+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:01PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Great.

Can you see now that that wasn't what he was saying? That he was saying that from his analysis of the ruleset of D&amp;D, that it pushes towards a certain kind of play (killing things, and taking their stuff), and that using it for other purposes (in his example, exploring deep character issues), might be unpleasant? And his final statement, that considering the power dynamic between GMs and players, that if the GM goes off the map of what the game is designed for, and forcing the players to conform could be considered "accidental torture" (an unpleasant experience with no malice intended)? <br/><br/>Once again, I'm not necessarily asking you if you agree, I'm asking more if you better understand what he was trying to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91905/#Comment_91905" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T16:07:06+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:07PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 4:07PM by James McMurray.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>First of all, while "Don't be a Dick" is a good rule of thumb, it does NOT make a good social conflict resolution system.<br/><br/>What if the rogue and the paladin's players aren't being dicks?

I can definitely agree with that notion - concepts like Paladins slipping into corruption, thieves finding redemption, and clashes between competing philosophies are very appealing to me.<br/><br/>What bothers me is this idea that it's up to the DM to create those situations and throw them onto unsuspecting players, who are then expected to provide standing ovations in return for hir narrative genius. Obviously, if the player gets enjoyment out of playing a Paladin who slips into corruption, SHe could choose to make in-game choices towards that end and slip a note to the DM indicating these choices are done purposely - flagging "Hey, look at me - I got a cool personal story arc going here". Or if the DM wants to centre a new plot arc around a character's Alignment conflicts, SHe could bloody well take the player aside and say "Hey, I want to do this thing where your character achieves redemption and maybe even shifts to Lawful - you cool with that? Can I count on your help?"<br/><br/>How does it make the game better - as in, more enjoyable for everyone - if the DM arbitrarily doles out these rulings? Why do we have to judge that player's performance and determine whether or not they are worthy of the stuff on their character sheet? These are honest - not rhetorical - questions.<br/><br/>These are ways of handling these things, fully within the scope of D&amp;D, that does not rely on players being arbitrarily robbed of their choice of tools. Hippie? Not at all - we did it with games like Vampire and Kult twelve or so years ago, without ever having heard of "Creative Agenda". I guess we just never felt the need to step on each others' toes with regards to ownership of our characters.<br/><br/>Hans' idea that the Alignments are restrictions is, of course, absolutely correct. In this sense, Alignment is supposed to be a deterrent to picking a class which would otherwise become too popular - maybe. That doesn't make much sense to me since, of course, D&amp;D has no mechanics to govern how Alignment restricts the player - rather, the restrictions are completely up for interpretation by the group or DM, which doesn't seem to make much sense in a "balanced" system.<br/><br/>But Hans is now relegated to the role of a measly player in our group (no doubt due to his disastrous failure in keeping the rules straight in Spirit of the Century), so nobody should feel the need to listen to him. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91968/#Comment_91968" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T21:06:59+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  9:06PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I said: "If there aren't rules for it, a game doesn't support it.

Things like art and fiction and stuff can have a huge impact on the colour of the game.  It's an important thing, and it shouldn't be discounted.  I'm not so sure, though, that the support continues much past colour.  For example, I think that Vampire's art and fiction encouraged a lot of behaviour and play styles that were then not supported (and in were in some ways actively discouraged) by the actual rules.  Similarly, Bachannal would not become a good game for combat simulation if you put a picture of a sword on the cover.  <br/><br/>James, I really don't know how to keep having this conversation with you.  It's not required for you to agree with any of the theory popular on this forum, but I'd think a bit of good sense about picking your battles would be in order.  If you don't buy into the theory, the conversation needs to start at a far more basic level than what we're talking about here.  That's not meant to sound eliteist.

Which is to say that, while I agree with you on the particulars of your arguments, that we shouldn't discourage James from posting in this thread. Perhaps James could be a bit less sarcastic, sure, but he's got a point he's trying to make. It's using this sort of tactic that you're using that causes folks to think that theory wonks like us are intellectually dishonest, or just mean (not that that's an accurate perception, neccessarily, but it's the perception). <br/>\n<br/>\nJames, realize that Simon and others might be getting fatigued debating with you, simply because we've been over this subject a lot here and elsewhere (or I could just be projecting). That's not an excuse for us to be dismissive, but when you fire of snarky line-by-line responses, you might not get our best behavior in return. I hope that the debate can contiune in better fashion on both sides. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn to other points:<br/>\nJD, this is another age-old argument, about whether setting material and textual encouragement have much effect. While I think that, sans other influences, they would influence game play, given actual mechanics, mechanics tend to win out. Worse, sometimes you get some players who are influenced by the mechanics and some by the setting material, and if these two do not agree, then you have real big problems at times. Hence why Vampire proves to be problematic for a lot of people, because the text speaks to "Storytelling" and how it's about the story, but the rules speak to how to have your Vampire kick ass. Yes, this doesn't mean automatic failure of people playing from their reading of the text, but I've read numerous cases where this has proven to be the situation. And experienced it first hand, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in fact, the idea that D&amp;D is about heroism and good/evil, comes into harsh conflict with the system at times, given players who buy into the idea of that heroism and good/evil being about stories. This is the problem under discussion. So your evidence is actually supporting the argument that there is a sort of play that's problematic out there involving confusion over what sort of game is being played. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, again, folks, nobody's attacking D&amp;D here. Saying that the system tends to support X style of play is not saying that D&amp;D is bad in any way. We're talking about an approach to play, promulgated by Gygax and used by many, that causes players to have bad game experiences. Saying, "Well we've never had that problem" isn't denying that others have. Nobody's saying that playing D&amp;D will cause the problem. Only that some who play D&amp;D have the problem - as do some that play BW, if they still have habits learned from playing D&amp;D this way, for instance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussion on social mechanics, etc, seems off topic to me - it started with my example, and now I'm sorry I used that example. I could have used many others that did not involve the potential for social mechanics to make my point, and then we'd not be discussing them. That said, another thread in which that discussion came up would probably be a wonderful idea. Just sayin'.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92067/#Comment_92067" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T07:42:56+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, remember, I see Vampire as primarily a genre book, so having ass-kicking art and gloomy text and a Humanity system all goes hand in hand.

Doesn't that mean it's up to the community (in this case the group) to figure out what's fun for them? Yes, if you don't give your GM any sort of direction (via clues or outright communication) then it's likely he'll come up with something that rubs you the wrong way. With the near infinite possiblities offered by an RPG, two people trying to hit each other's goals with shots in the dark are unlikely to happen. That's not the system failing, that's communication failing.\n<blockquote>Obviously, if the player gets enjoyment out of playing a Paladin who slips into corruption, SHe could choose to make in-game choices towards that end and slip a note to the DM indicating these choices are done purposely - flagging "Hey, look at me - I got a cool personal story arc going here". Or if the DM wants to centre a new plot arc around a character's Alignment conflicts, SHe could bloody well take the player aside and say "Hey, I want to do this thing where your character achieves redemption and maybe even shifts to Lawful - you cool with that? Can I count on your help?"</blockquote>\nExactly! Communication! :-D\n<blockquote>How does it make the game better - as in, more enjoyable for everyone - if the DM arbitrarily doles out these rulings? Why do we have to judge that player's performance and determine whether or not they are worthy of the stuff on their character sheet? These are honest - not rhetorical - questions.</blockquote>\nI assume by "arbitrarily" you mean "without communication, and against the wishes of the player. That most definitely doesn't make play better, and I'm pretty sure I never said it did. If, for example, you want to play a paladin that does evil acts and never has a problem because of it, you'll need to either play a paladin-esque backstory or house rule the paladin's alignment, because the system is in opposition to your desires. But that would be just like someone wanting to play a thoroughly unreligious Dog roaming the Vinyards (or the opposite of whatever character trait defines a Dog if my layman's understanding is incorrect).\n<blockquote>These are ways of handling these things, fully within the scope of D&amp;D, that does not rely on players being arbitrarily robbed of their choice of tools. Hippie? Not at all - we did it with games like Vampire and Kult twelve or so years ago, without ever having heard of "Creative Agenda". I guess we just never felt the need to step on each others' toes with regards to ownership of our characters.</blockquote>\nI agree, there are ways to handle it. They usually involve communication with a distinct lack of dickery.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>James, I really don't know how to keep having this conversation with you.</blockquote>\nNobody is saying you have to, are they?\n<blockquote>It's not required for you to agree with any of the theory popular on this forum, but I'd think a bit of good sense about picking your battles would be in order.</blockquote>\nWhere's the fun in that? ;-)\n<blockquote>If you don't buy into the theory, the conversation needs to start at a far more basic level than what we're talking about here. That's not meant to sound eliteist. I just don't understand why you'd care about this conversation, since it pertains to things you in which have an avowed disbelief.</blockquote>\nI'm enjoying myself, both learning about things I didn't know about, and talking about things that interest me. Since the other participants haven't started screaming curse words and stomping off, I have to assume they're enjoying themselves as well. By the way, when you have to say "that's not meant to sound elitist" it probably means you've just said something elitist. If you don't want it to sound that way it's usually better to rephrase it then try to excuse it.\n<blockquote>Your dismissive attitude and sarcasm are really not helping either. If you're really interested in understanding the theory we're talking about here, how about starting new topic?</blockquote>\nBecause this one is still doing it's job?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>James, realize that Simon and others might be getting fatigued debating with you, simply because we've been over this subject a lot here and elsewhere (or I could just be projecting).

I hope that the debate can contiune in better fashion on both sides.</blockquote>\nIf people don't like debating with me, they certainly don't have to. The block quote style I use is to make sure I respond to everyone. I can click quote, read a post, click quote, read another, etc. When I'm done the response box is filled and ready for me, and I can be sure I didn't forget something. If you know another way to do that which doesn't require block quotes and doesn't risk various replies getting mixed in with one another, I'm all for it. It'll have to cope with my tendency to ramble though. Having a block of text below what I'm typing that's waiting for a reply goes far in making sure I stay focused.\n<blockquote>Again, again, folks, nobody's attacking D&amp;D here.

Please inform me as to how game mechanics are not a formalized method of communication. We call it a "conflict resolution system" for a reason. It is there to resolve in-game and out-of-game conflicts by a mechanism everyone who has sat down at the same table agrees upon.<br><br>Just shrugging and saying the word "communication", however, is not satisfactory. Communication is as poorly-defined as your definition of "roleplay" or "dicks". If saying "communication " to a room full of people and have everyone agree on what it meant in every situation was feasible, we wouldn't need explicit mechanics - "rules" as you call them.<br><br>Not being on the same page with regards to communication about the game doesn't mean that people at the table are being "dicks". Hell, as has been revealed in this thread, AD&amp;D specifically tells us that there should be systematic penalties for "ignoring" Alignment, and Gygax clarifies that in the case of the Paladin and the orc that means [some lengthy and convoluted interpretation of what actions the Paladin should take] and anything less deserves a DM smackdown. I think this can be assumed to be a fairly widespread notion if one of the most prominent creators of the game thinks that's how it should be handled, even if it happens to have never touched play at your table.<br/><br/>So to tie this back to how it started, I claimed that a DM that centres the game of D&amp;D around Alignment "issues" rather than about ph4t l3wt is doing the players a disservice, because the game isn't about Alignment nuances. There are no rules to adjudicate Alignment other than "up to DM interpretation", and there are no rules to reward the player either for using or "misusing" their chosen Alignment. Instead, Alignment acts as a kind of "flaw" which can be used to only mechanically penalize the player and which restrict hir actions. Further, the decision to rewrite a player's character choices are left up to the DM (in AD&amp;D - clearly, this has changed for the better in D&amp;D 3e).<br/><br/>As I can see it, this problem has two clear, workable solutions. The first is to not make the game about Alignment at all. The player made a choice and until SHe informs us otherwise, SHe feels that choice remains true for hir. Since Alignment has no impact on this kind of game, we just respect that person's choice.<br/><br/>The second solution is "communication" - that is, define the Alignments in no uncertain terms up front. How would a Chaotic Evil necromancer react when faced with a starving baby? How would a True Neutral druid react to a divinely created typhoon? In the end, the idea is that we'd be able to tell exactly when a character overstepped their boundaries and we'd assume they knew, too. Please note that this is effectively a house rule directly contradicting the notion that it's "up to DM interpretation".<br/><br/>A third suggested solution is to have the DM warn players when their characters actions are putting their Alignment choice in danger. I don't consider this workable, since spur-of-the-moment assertions like that tends to breed resentment at the table as players feel their characters choices are ultimately outside their control. That's definitely Illusionism at its worst - though if that works for you, have fun!\n<blockquote>That last sentence negates your entire paragraph. It's very hard to say "we're not blaming D&amp;D" and then end it with, "even BW players might have these problems, if they played D&amp;D."</blockquote>\nYou're missing the corollary, which forms much of the basis of my argument: D&amp;D players would have to cope with exactly the issues I'm talking about if they'd played BW. They might mistakenly believe that the game is about the transformation of the characters' Alignments, in the same way BW is centred around conflicts regarding characters' Beliefs.<br/><br/>So no, nobody's blaming D&amp;D. If there's any blame being laid anywhere, it's the notion some DMs (and players) have that D&amp;D should be more "sophisticated" and if the other players aren't interested in following along on their sadomasochistic penalty fest (since D&amp;D doesn't reward such play), they're munchkins or powergamers.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92157/#Comment_92157" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T09:56:57+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  9:56AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>I don't see how you can get the conclusion that the games weren't written for roleplaying.

"Roleplaying" in iterations of the game where it was a central concept is limited to character acting to add flavour to the characters and the story.<br/>By contrast, games where social conflicts are central have mechanical support for it, or at least a very well-defined system for free-form play, like Amber.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92158/#Comment_92158" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T10:00:55+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:00AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi James,<br/><br/>What I think is really interesting here, and bear with me if it sounds like I'm going off topic, is this:<br/><br/>A) We're talking about whether or not there are "nonwritten rules" or "social precepts" or whatever; the general idea of whether or not playing a RPG uses more than just the rules in the book, and<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> When I went back and read the last few pages of this thread, and in my head replaced "roleplaying game" with "discussion forum", <i>it felt like the thread was an example of the very thing we're arguing.</i><br/><br/>Let me try to explain, and again I'm trying to present a point not argue one, so please bear with me.<br/><br/>In this thread, my first reading felt like some other people were wanting to talk about the merits of GM force as a tool for playing D&amp;D, and you were wanting to debate. And that generally you were having a great time taking on all comers, and enjoying yourself; and that the other folks really weren't, so much.<br/><br/>In the last few posts there was some discussion about whether or not people were enjoying themselves in this discussion, and getting what they wanted out of it. You said something like "I'm having fun, and I figure as long as other people aren't cursing and closing the thread, they are too." But they <i>have</i> been making some pretty clear indications, at least to me, that they felt like they weren't really able to discuss the topic itself with you very well, because you were too busy debating the underpinnings of their argument, so they were having a hard time even really getting to what they would enjoy talking about in the topic.<br/><br/>So, just my gut reaction: Different people "debating a topic", coming at it from different ways, and some satisfied, some not, and having a tough time articulating what they'd want to change to make the discussion more fun, and more useful, to them.<br/><br/>And I went, "Hey, I've played in <i>a lot</i> of games that felt just like that." Different people gathered together to perform the same activity, same rules in front of them, but approaching it from a different mindset that makes it hard to actually enjoy the activity together, even though they all want to do it.<br/><br/>Does that analogy make any sense to anybody but me? I don't think I've worded it well. My general point is that "Just roleplay, don't be a dick" is kind of like "Just discuss the topic, don't be a dick." Everybody is following the latter precept in this thread, but it isn't enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92176/#Comment_92176" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T10:22:27+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's more than that, Mikael. In point of fact, the earliest editions of D&amp;D DID NOT give any idea of what it meant to "role-play" a character, and, in fact, I'll have to look, but that first edition may not even have the word "role-playing" in the text at all. Again, the cover does not say, "Role-playing game" on it, it says something like "Rules for Chainmail Fantasy Miniatures Gaming." It was a supplement for Chainmail, a miniatures warfare game. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore to the point, I was there, and I dealt with the emerging cultures. Ron Edwards aptly uses the term "Cargo Cults" to describe how most groups of RPG players had to figure out how to play RPGs - the books simply do not say much of anything about how to play at all, they just have rules for resolving miniatures-like combat. To that extent, people went off in all sorts of directions. Many or most of them quite functional. One of them, however, while not always 100% problematic, tended to confuse play priorities in a way that caused problems. And there are groups that still have these problems today, because of this tradition of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nJames, you seem determined to see some sort of malice against D&amp;D in my posts. If you read the sentence without your paraphrasing, you'll see that what I'm saying is that if you have a group coming from Burning Wheel as their first game, the odds of them developing the problem in question is pretty small. But if they come from D&amp;D, there's a chance. Not becuase D&amp;D promotes this sort of play, but because of the lack of direction that I mention that causes the Cargo Cult phenomenon, and because DMs wanting story tried certain tactics to force it to occur in D&amp;D play - D&amp;D play which, otherwise, can tend to go in a different direction - beause of this, there's a distinct problem that crops up in this sort of play. Not D&amp;D play. In the sort of play where D&amp;D is forced into doing things for which it's design just happens to cause this particular problem. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your response style, James, again, it's not the quoting that's problematic itself (I encourage this), but that you pick out snippets you find disagreeable, without the rest of the context in some cases, and then proceed to ridicule the idea in question. This is tiring, because, instead of trying to understand the point we're making, and then arguing against that, we have to restate our arguments over and over. Sure, we could just ignore you, but is that what you really want? A forum for stating your own opinions entirely unchallenged? I mean, you come in and challenge an idea in this thread, surely you expect that to turn into debate, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm just asking you to try to understand the ideas we're presenting before presenting your objections. To the extent that we've done a poor job of describing our points, well, we'll keep trying to do better. We're trying to understand your points, but they're hard to argue against when they don't seem to be addressing the points we're bringing up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it's possible that we can discover some interesting things in this debate, but only if we're not all just out to win the argument. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92180/#Comment_92180" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T10:27:24+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 10:29AM by jzn.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> When I went back and read the last few pages of this thread, and in my head replaced "roleplaying game" with "discussion forum",<i>it felt like the thread was an example of the very thing we're arguing.</i></blockquote>\nIt's a good analogy, but it's so much easier to be a dick on the internet!   Not that it doesn't happen in real life, mind you, I'm just sayin',  internet social rules take a while to adapt to.

I don't know how strong a motivator this was, but Dave Arneson (the guy who co-created D&amp;D) certainly seems to think it was.<br/><br/>I think that there is a perception that Gygax needed to define what the game was, firmly, in his own words, primarily because he needed it to be his product. (I tend to agree with that, but that's just my interpretation.) <br/><br/>As far as the act of roleplaying not being a fundamental activity within D&amp;D <i>in terms of resolution mechanics</i>, going by a recent ENWorld thread about folks who played D&amp;D at Gencon with Gygax, there was lots of in character interaction <i>with the environment</i>. Things like "I search this wall for a hidden door." "Okay, how?" "Well, I'll twist the torch sconce...", etc.<br/><br/>I get this vibe from that kind of play, which I've participated in, that the "GM knows the world, players try things, GM adjudicates" works very non-controversially with environment interactions. There's either a pit there, or there isn't, and everyone's going to trust that the GM knows which is which.<br/><br/>Where it doesn't provide much help is stuff like "You've angered your god, there will be consequences". The player probably isn't exploring his relationship with his deity in the same concrete, high-feedback sense that he's exploring the dungeon by feeling the wall for a press-plate. Furthermore, the "answer", being a weighed moral judgement, is more debatable than "Yep, you found the door" or "Oops, you've triggered a trap." <br/><br/>I definately think that "Just roleplay it out" is a system, or subsystem -- Amber DRPG uses this as its full resolution mechanic, basically. But I do think that the system as applied to imaginary walls and floors, versus moral questions, gives a pretty good amount of support on how to do the former, and not as much on the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92238/#Comment_92238" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T11:43:45+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 11:44AM by James McMurray.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>&lt;//i&gt;&lt;//i&gt;James, you're using "communication" as your end-all-be-all fix to this problem. Please inform me as to how game mechanics are not a formalized method of communication. We call it a "conflict resolution system" for a reason. It is there to resolve in-game and out-of-game conflicts by a mechanism everyone who has sat down at the same table agrees upon.</blockquote>\nWhere did I say that social rules weren't conflict resolution mechanics? Or that game mechanics are formalized? What I'm saying is that a game without social conflict rules doesn't need them if communication in the group is functioning properly. A game with social conflict rules is still going to fail to work if the group's communication is broken.\n<blockquote>Just shrugging and saying the word "communication", however, is not satisfactory. Communication is as poorly-defined as your definition of "roleplay" or "dicks". If saying "communication " to a room full of people and have everyone agree on what it meant in every situation was feasible, we wouldn't need explicit mechanics - "rules" as you call them.</blockquote>\nIf you do not understand the definition o the words I'm using, I suggest a dictionary. This is not some sor of homegrown terminology I'm making up as I go along. I'm using english words as they are meant to be used in the english language.\n<blockquote>Not being on the same page with regards to communication about the game doesn't mean that people at the table are being "dicks".</blockquote>\nWhere did I say it did? Quite obviously our communication is broken, because what I think I'm saying and what you think you're hearing differ. Do you think that any amount of social conflict rules in a game we're playing will fix this?\n<blockquote>As I can see it, this problem has two clear, workable solutions. The first is to not make the game about Alignment at all. The player made a choice and until SHe informs us otherwise, SHe feels that choice remains true for hir. Since Alignment has no impact on this kind of game, we just respect that person's choice.<br/><br/>The second solution is "communication" - that is, define the Alignments in no uncertain terms up front. How would a Chaotic Evil necromancer react when faced with a starving baby? How would a True Neutral druid react to a divinely created typhoon? In the end, the idea is that we'd be able to tell exactly when a character overstepped their boundaries and we'd assume they knew, too. Please note that this is effectively a house rule directly contradicting the notion that it's "up to DM interpretation".<br/><br/>A third suggested solution is to have the DM warn players when their characters actions are putting their Alignment choice in danger. I don't consider this workable, since spur-of-the-moment assertions like that tends to breed resentment at the table as players feel their characters choices are ultimately outside their control. That's definitely Illusionism at its worst - though if that works for you, have fun!</blockquote>\nThen what are we arguing about? That's what I've been saying all along. What you an I consider house rules and workable differ, but you've grasped (or always knew) the underlying concepts I've been trying to express. <br/><br/>I consider this a success. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>In particular, I think most people are making the observation that the lack of rules for social interaction meant that the conflicts the game revolves around aren't meant to be social.

However, if you look at the published adventures of the time, going all the way back to gygax's Keep on the Borderland, you find all sorts of setups that are only useful if you've got social interaction going on (like fully detailed keeps). EX1, EX2, and T1-4 (especiall T1) offer insane amounts of situations that can only be intended for social play (unless you assume that fully detailed towns are meant to be slaughtered, and the mysteries put forth are just flavor text that the PCs are never meant to experience). And that's just Gygax's adventures. DDA1, DLx, etc.<br/><br/>AC1 (Shady Dragon Inn), was designed exclusively to allow DMs to introduce social interaction. I could name more, since that's just a small sampling of the AD&amp;D adventures. For instance, Secret of Bone Hill's sercret isn't "here's some stuff for you to kill and loot."

Oddly enough, the includion of social mechanics in later editions has always been met with much complaint by the old gaurd. Not because people are happily engaged in accidental torture, but because the impression is that social mechanics are a detriment for True Roleplaying<sup>TM</sup> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92268/#Comment_92268" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T12:40:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 12:40PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow. I feel, like, a night and day difference between your last two posts, James. I imagine a lot of that was because we were "starting fresh" on it, rather than trying to carry on various elements across a multi-page discussion. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So I'm going to try to touch on, in my words, what I <i>think</i> people were trying to talk about way back when when they said "Accidental torture". (I grant that it's a label that provokes emotional response, so I'm ditching it -- just trying to talk about what I think they were trying to address.)<br/><br/>I'm, like, totally on the same page with you as far as our shared assumptions for discussion about everything in that last post. That said, I'd like to take one bit of it and continue talking about it.<br/><br/>We're in agreement that old modules supported the idea of play where the DM and players sort of roleplay out tinkering with secret doors and such, no argument there. I also agree that there were plenty of elements in old modules that intended the players to roleplay social interaction with NPCs. (I can assure you, definately, that nobody's arguing that those townsfolk and town leaders were there to be slaughtered.)<br/><br/>The difference I want to address is this: While in both cases the players act out interaction with imaginary stuff in the game (a secret door, or a town magistrate), the two are different in terms of what the game does to "support" those interactions. Support is in scare quotes there, because I think I really mean "Provide context and level-setting". That is to say, there's a lot of both mechanical and "this is what the world is like" stuff in the D&amp;D books and modules about what interacting with secret doors islike, and not so much about what town magistrates is like. The latter, the most you're going to get usually a bit of information about the political context of the keep and what this guy acts like.<br/><br/>(This isn't an either-or, it's a continuum; the most "supported" stuff is stuff like to-hit and damage -- the rules can do it all for you there.)<br/><br/>So the follow-on assumption is that the group has to "carry the load" a bit more when roleplaying out a social interaction than a physical one. Because, say, the system doesn't provide as many cues, and (unlike, say, secret doors or traps) there's no fall-back to "Okay, we're having trouble figuring out what happens -- so let's roll the dice and we can get a result and move on."<br/><br/>This isn't a negative connotation, therefore, to say that D&amp;D doesn't "support" social interactions as well as it "supports" other things. (For my mangled definition of support, of course.) <br/><br/>I think you'd sort of say "Duh, obviously", to this, and if not I'd ask if we could replace "support" with some other phrasing and then you'd agree with it. Again, I'm not trying to set up some kind of slippery slope where I go, "Aha, you agreed it doesn't support this as much is it does other things, therefore it is bad! Gotcha!" I'm totally not interested in doing that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So, where am I going? My personal understanding is that for that stuff where the group's social dynamic has to "do the heavy lifting" rather than the rules, unless the group is (consciously or unconsciously) aware that they have to do that lifting at all, and that their responsibility as a group is to integrate into a coherent social dynamic, you can get problems. We can call it miscommunication, or dickery, or whatever. <br/><br/>I'm basically saying that those areas are the most likely to lead to dissatisfaction if they're not addressed. Furthermore, because (in my personal experience) lots of people think that their group's social dynamics are all sorted, and miscommunications aren't going to happen, but <i>they still happen</i>. <br/><br/>That dissatisfaction, where people think that the group-specific social context works one way, and it really doesn't... I think that's what people meant by "accidental torture".<br/><br/>Again, not an argument, just a discussion -- I'd be frickin' psyched if you said something like "Okay, then D&amp;D can lead to 'accidental torture' by your definition... but not by mine", or "Okay, that social dynamic might be off, but it's not the game's fault, the game is not responsible for that." Or whatever, really, just that you see where I'm coming from even if you don't agree. I think we've all gotten a better handle on that in the last couple of pages. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92269/#Comment_92269" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T12:45:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 12:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>I see malice in posts that say "BW players might suffer from problems, if they've played D&amp;D."

Well, mostly. He's excited and involved, he has a great time doing the roleplaying thing... it's just that he constantly steps on our toes. He'll pop in, resolve some conflict quickly and violently that some other folks are like half-way through with, and basically leave them feeling deflated. He's not done anything <i>wrong</i>, not really, but we're just not as happy about how the game turned out as he is, and we don't know how to articulate that. <br/><br/>He'd be like, "I saw you and your Dad were having a complex argument, and you were debating between forsaking your duty to join him, or having to kill your own Dad, and that was a tough moral choice -- so I killed him for you! Gordian Knot cleaved! Wha, what do you mean that's not satisfying?"<br/><br/>Yeah, it's just a social dynamic thing, we should fix it, but we don't know how, and he doesn't even see there is a problem.<br/><br/>We've played roleplaying games where, mechanically, you invest towards certain outcomes -- kind of putting XP into changing the game world, so to speak. In those games, it's mechanically harder to "take charge" of a conflict involving stuff you're not invested in. It's mechanically easier to affect a conflict that you're tightly bound into. <br/><br/>So when we're playing the game, now, he doesn't necessarily grok that socially we want people to invest in a situation before trying to overturn the apple cart -- but he gets that mechanically he needs to do so. Things go more smoothly, people don't feel like his unforshadowed 11th hour betrayals or whatever are going to invalidate whole sessions of "stuff". <br/><br/>I view that from the perspective that we took an issue -- having the least invested person in a major conflict determine its outcome -- and went from a system that didn't "support" the issue to one that did "support" it. And, <i>for our group</i>, the game was more enjoyable.<br/><br/>So that's why I personally see a benefit in systems offering rules to assist with things that other games expect you to "roleplay out". Of course games should handle this differently -- different rules, and different social dynamics, are going to be present in different happy, functional groups. <br/><br/>(As an aside, this guy, when he DMed, "accidentally tortured" (can we just call this "accidentally fostered a painful disconnect", or something? the torture word's way too much of a red flag) me, like, the whole damn game. He had certain set assumptions about how we were supposed to interact with NPCs (full dialog, acted out -- which I frickin' hate and am bad at), and rather than just ask if we could change it, I painfully tried to do what he wanted. It sucked, my character came across as incompetant both compared to his conception in my head and to his stated party role, and I didn't enjoy it. But he did, so I acted like I did.<br/><br/>Nowadays we just talk through stuff like that, but even so I've never been able to get him to see why I didn't like it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92277/#Comment_92277" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T13:04:29+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  1:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 4:14PM by Andy.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>lots of stuff I agree with. </blockquote>\n"That social dynamic might be off, but it's not the game's fault, the game is not responsible for that." :-D\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>I see malice in posts that say "BW players might suffer from problems, if they've played D&amp;D."

I generally avoid taking the converse of someone's statements and trying to decide if they believe that. I agree that "D&amp;D players might suffer from problems, if they've played BW", but think it's a foolish way to word it, as it lays the blame at the incorrect doorstep. The problem isn't whether D&amp;D causes BW players problems, or vice versa. The problem is in the bad communication going on in both situations, regardless of the trappings of the game sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92289/#Comment_92289" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T13:26:25+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  1:26PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite><i><i><i><i><i><i></i></i></i></i></i></i><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>lots of stuff I agree with.</blockquote>\n"That social dynamic might be off, but it's not the game's fault, the game is not responsible for that." :-D<br/><br/><br/>Awesome.

No, I don't, not 100%. Damn it! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In D&amp;D, the game's absolutely not responsible for that. But a game can be responsible for that stuff. At least, it can address the stuff that D&amp;D doesn't. And follow on, for me only, because it addresses, helps figure out, the stuff that D&amp;D doesn't, and that stuff is a cause of friction with our group, therefore (for us) we have more fun with that other game than we do with D&amp;D.<br/><br/>For example, we played a game once that was thematically about betrayal. Lots of inter-party conflict, and mechanical and setting-based "stuff" that helped us play through the causes and effects of betrayal, both PC to NPC and PC to PC. Yes, I'll grant that we could have played that game in D&amp;D if we'd had a lot of up-front discussion about the themes and how we wanted to handle things ... but I think we all agree the rules themselves aren't giving as much guidance than in the system we ended up using.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm really talking about is, "How do you decide what issues and elements you want to be important in a game, and how much of that do you leave to system rather than to social dynamics? And can rules inform (or possibly change) social dynamics as they play out in the game?"<br/><br/>Your answer on that is clear, mine isn't (I'm still pondering on it), and they're both right, for us.  So it's not much of a debate, but it's got me thinking hard and I'm glad we have been discussing it. And, I dunno, maybe "I wonder why that is" is an interesting followup question. Or "How do these social dynamics come to form independently of the rules", or "Does the traditional 'DM is final arbiter of the rules' ever turn into 'DM is final arbiter of the social dynamics'?"

Right? Your quote is not what I said. You're paraphrase may be how you interpret what I wrote, but it's not what I wrote. Right? <br/><br/>After you paraphrased the first time, I tried to communicate the idea again to you so you could see, hopefully, that I do not mean what you apparently think I mean. But you insist on continuing to treat my words as if they could only mean what your paraphrase means (despite them having a very different literal meaning).</blockquote>\nWhich paraphrase are you talking about? I don't deny that I paraphrased you in a response, that's what I do to make sure I understand what I'm reading. If I changed the meaning in your post by doing so that was completely unintentional. I tried to go back and find what you were referring to but I've quoted you several times.\n<blockquote>If you're not willing to try to understand me, then I'm not surprised that you have such a low estimation of how well debates can go on the internet. They can go precisely as well as the debaters intend, and I've been in plenty that were extremely useful to everyone involved. I feel bad that we're not making progress in this one. <br/><br/>It's mostly a joke, tied to the old/new saying about how arguments on the internet are like the special olympics. Although I do think nobody wins an argument, either on the internet or elsewhere. That doesn't make them useless, as sometimes they become discussions, and then everybody can win. Just look at Sweeneytodd's and my thread through this topic. We've both won, but not via argument.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92310/#Comment_92310" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T14:32:16+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  2:32PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 2:38PM by SweeneyTodd.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With you on everything so far -- sounds like we've had similar experiences, in fact. Breaking out the request for clarification.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite><br/>So I guess what I'm really talking about is, "How do you decide what issues and elements you want to be important in a game, and how much of that do you leave to system rather than to social dynamics? And can rules inform (or possibly change) social dynamics as they play out in the game?"<br/><br/>Your answer on that is clear,</blockquote>\nIs it? That's not a jibe, I'm really interested in what answer I've given and what answer was heard.<br/><br/><br/>I was taking that as a follow-on from \n<blockquote>"That social dynamic might be off, but it's not the game's fault, the game is not responsible for that." :-D</blockquote>\nBut, aha! I see that, yeah, you were speaking to D&amp;D specifically, and I was probably speaking more to roleplaying games generally, with D&amp;D as one example. The general case is more interesting, so yeah, I don't know your answer. I thought I did from the discussion so far, so thanks for pointing that out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So, common ground: Communication is as essential in roleplaying as it is in any other social activity. Possibly more so for the bits that don't have as many "cues" as real life activities do.<br/><br/>So the assertion people are making, generally, is that this is not only essential, it's so essential that it's worth figuring out how to make it repeatable, and doable even in situations where that communication doesn't naturally occur. (No methods are going to make people who want to be dicks, not be dicks, granted. I'm talking more here about "We're not on the same page, even though we thought we were" stuff, which I think happens a lot.)<br/><br/>So, how that sort of connects to the general tone and context of story-games: Lots of folks here either design games, or think about designs, or just think about the medium and methods of roleplaying a lot. To the point where "Oh, just roleplay it out" is as unsatisfying an answer as "Just act it out" would be for somebody who thinks, breaths, bleeds acting. Or "Just follow the directions" would be unsatisfying to a model airplane enthusiast who lives to tinker with designs.<br/><br/>So it's like, "Just roleplay it out" is one way to label this BIG FUCKING BOX O' STUFF, and for the folks who are used to trying to figure out what all the parts are in that box, and have kicked around a half-dozen theories on how to label and classify stuff in that box, and have gotten their fingers bitten off (figuratively) when they tried to reach into the box and the group said "Just roleplay it", it's not that that's *wrong*, just that they want to delve in and discuss it in more detail.<br/><br/>That's, I think, some of the disconnect. So when I'm like "Okay, so some bits are social and some are rules, why are they split like that? And how does that help or hinder different stuff we want to do with these games?", it's not asking "why" as in "We don't think it is, you do, justify yourself" -- it's asking "why" as in "How does this stuff, in your mind, break apart, and what are the factors? I ask because I've been thinking about this stuff too, and comparing our opinions may be interesting."<br/><br/>(As far as the above post with Mike: Let me be clear that I was feeling as pissed as he sounds, earlier in the thread. I stepped back and came at it from a totally different angle -- the Gygax stuff was really just me musing -- and your responses made me go "Hell, well now I understand how he's talking about this." Before that, I was irked. So, I really think Mike's irritation (though I shouldn't speak for him, I realize) may be coming out of the fact that he and I are trying to talk about the same kinds of stuff, only I got lucky with not getting tangled up in the specific wording and points involved. Which is itself a really common problem when talking about roleplaying games, and in fact as I think we ever get when talking about this stuff on some other forums. )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92317/#Comment_92317" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T14:53:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  2:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fairly interesting thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to comment on the presence of the big-gaping-hole in DnD of leaving wide swaths of interactions (social interactions, exploring the world) with no mechanics. One reaction to this is that we should try plugging the hole with mechanics. Another is that we should just try "not to be a dick". But expanding on that, maybe learning "not to be a dick" is something one learns, as an art form. You can get a little bit of it by reading examples of play in books. More from just experience. But I think maybe part of what Gygax was getting at is that it can also be learned from others with experience, by just playing with and emulating them. Between personal experience and apprenticeship, one eventually cultivates an intuitive sense of handling the "just roleplaying" aspect of DnD.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, like art, the skill of just winging it can't be categorized, summarized, analyzed easily. It's just something one picks up with time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure I agree with this approach, but here is a thought on a more specific case. Consider the trade-off between perfect character fidelity and harmonizing with the needs of other players. One way to handle this is with a mechanic that automatically balances the two. Another way is to just... try to balance the two goals, using experience and instinct. The former method has some obvious advantages. But the latter one might also:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The weight between the two is decided by the player, and the optimal amount of weight is a matter of taste. For example, in extreme cases some indy games solve the problem by abandoning character-fidelity entirely. For some that's a perfect solution. For others, its a catastrophe. <br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH maybe the answer here is to have a plethora of games, or mechanics with "sliders" that can be adjusted  to taste.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Maybe with sufficient "mastery" a human being can always, with just instinct and experience, do better than the cold mechanic, even holding values fixed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe that's why Gygax puts so much weight on a vague, hard-to-describe and quantify, mastery of roleplaying skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans" title="Hans"><img alt="Hans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans">Hans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92322/#Comment_92322" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T15:08:21+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  3:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite><br/>And maybe that's why Gygax puts so much weight on a vague, hard-to-describe and quantify, mastery of roleplaying skill.</blockquote>\nI think you have hit on something here, Cydmab, although whether my reaction to it is completely on topic or not I have no idea.

What they said was "Rules for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil and Miniature Figures". (You can check that over at the Acaeum.)<br/><br/>Note that this was the edition that was published in 1974 and thus preceded both Holmes Basic and the AD&amp;D Monster Manual by 3 years.<br/><br/>However, I think Mike is incorrect insofar as he's talking about the <i>intent</i> of those early rules. While the term "roleplaying" wasn't current at the time, D&amp;D wasn't designed as a "wargame" in the vein of Chainmail or other miniatures rules sets. Instead it was a development, through Dave Arneson's Blackmoor campaign, of ideas which had originated with Dave Weseley's "Braunstein" games, which were basically RPGs by another name. Arneson used Chainmail as an adjunct to roleplaying, to handle combat (though he also developed the "alternate" combat rules which later became the standard AC/"to hit" mechanic).<br/><br/>Sources:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mage-page.com/index.php?pageid=17" rel="nofollow">A Brief History of Role Playing Games</a> by Victor Raymond. (In private correspondence, Victor explained to me that he got much of his information directly from Dave Arneson.)<br/><a href="http://theminiaturespage.com/boards/msg.mv?id=73010" rel="nofollow">Reproduction of an account of the Braunstein -&gt; D&amp;D development</a> (Bottom post on the page, drawn from an essay that was to accompany a D&amp;D documentary.)<br/>And generally, other interviews with Arneson and Weseley, which are scattered around the net.<br/><br/>Now, <i>intent</i> is of course separate from expression, and I don't have the original D&amp;D texts handy at the moment; I do recall that they were pretty poorly presented, which might have led to some seeing the game purely as a wargame (in the sense that later was differentiated from "RPG"). However, I kinda doubt it, because frankly, D&amp;D isn't a very <i>good</i> wargame, and if it was received and transmitted on those terms, it would have failed completely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92372/#Comment_92372" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T19:35:26+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:35PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nicely historianalyzed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92390/#Comment_92390" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T22:52:30+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:52PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>But, aha!

It's just that so much has been said back and forth in this that I wanted to make sure I understood what I was saying as well as everyone else. It seemed like an especially appropriate question given the focus on communication in the thread. :-)\n<blockquote>So, common ground: Communication is as essential in roleplaying as it is in any other social activity. Possibly more so for the bits that don't have as many "cues" as real life activities do.</blockquote>\nDefinitely. When you're at a party and someone turns the music on, then starts to shimmy around you can be pretty sure they want to dance, and can possibly tell by their body language whether it's an invitation for everyone to dance. If you're roleplaying being at a party, there's no way for anyone to know what you want to do unless you vocalize. that's a horrible example, but it's all I've got at this hour.\n<blockquote>So the assertion people are making, generally, is that this is not only essential, it's so essential that it's worth figuring out how to make it repeatable, and doable even in situations where that communication doesn't naturally occur. (No methods are going to make people who want to be dicks, not be dicks, granted. I'm talking more here about "We're not on the same page, even though we thought we were" stuff, which I think happens a lot.)</blockquote>\nStill in complete agreement. I'll also add that while some people will always be dicks, another important part of gaming (or any sustained social activity) is learning how to best distance yourself from the dicks, and how to get along with them if you absolutely must.\n<blockquote>So it's like, "Just roleplay it out" is one way to label this BIG FUCKING BOX O' STUFF, and for the folks who are used to trying to figure out what all the parts are in that box, and have kicked around a half-dozen theories on how to label and classify stuff in that box, and have gotten their fingers bitten off (figuratively) when they tried to reach into the box and the group said "Just roleplay it", it's not that that's *wrong*, just that they want to delve in and discuss it in more detail.</blockquote>\nI think that biting someone's head off for wanting to explore something is definitely wrong. That would classify as dickery. Likewise, if they continually want to try to get you to explore it when you don't want to, that would be dickery as well. If you can't come to a middle ground you'll either get apart or have troubles, and no addition or removal of system from the equation is going to fix that, because the underlying issue isn't a system issue.\n<blockquote>(As far as the above post with Mike: Let me be clear that I was feeling as pissed as he sounds, earlier in the thread.

Even if a game has an award system in place for alignment-related behavior, the grey zone stuff is still going to be unfun for players that don't want it. For example, simply adding the house rule "hey guys, I'm gonna give bonus XP for playing your paladin as walking the line" isn't going to suddenly make those character types fun. What it'll do is have some people playing paladins, and others players their favorite character type, with the non-paladins feeling shafted because the paladins are getting bonus experience "every time they drag the game down into that boring grey zone b.s."\n<blockquote>* A suitable antidote for that is to allow players themselves absolute authority over alignment interpretations.</blockquote>\nThat's one way to do it.
