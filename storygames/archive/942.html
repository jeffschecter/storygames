                    I've been thinking about Thomas' thread about chaotic play: where a subset of the gaming group can play the game without needing the whole group. It's particularly suited for online play, where you could have a large gaming group, and the story progresses by small groups playing together in short bursts.<br/><br/>How about everything in the gaming world has traits? Those traits can be anything - for a character, a trait might be "I'm a good shot"; for a bag, it might be "Made of leather". Each trait has an associated number of dice.<br/><br/>Each player has a steady of supply of dice which they can "spend": they can create new traits, create new items or add dice to existing traits.<br/><br/>(This is very like Universalis, of course).<br/><br/>You can also attack traits. To do this, you pit a trait under your control against the trait you want to attack. Then you make some sort of dice roll between the traits to determine who wins. If you successfully attack the trait, you may rewrite it or remove it.<br/><br/>So, for example, let's say you've built a house with traits of "Sturdy", "Pleasant" and "Surrounded by grass". My character is an ogre, with traits of "Stupid", "Strong" and "Huge". Even though you're not currently signed into the game, I attack your house's "Sturdy" trait with my "Strong" trait. When you next sign in, you find that your house is now "Rickety", "Pleasant" and "Surrounded by grass".<br/><br/>You'd need some kind of bullshit call, of course, so that I can't attack your "Surrounded by grass" trait with my "Stupid" trait without a very good reason. So perhaps you can query the attack, in some way, and your query gets emailed around some other players to see if they agree.<br/><br/>This is all a bit thrown together, of course. But any comments / expansions / other ideas so far?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            This makes me think of <a href="http://www.urbandead.com/" rel="nofollow">Urban Dead</a>, actually, although more as an example of chaotic play in general.  Many is the time when I've returned to UD to discover my heavily barricaded safe house was now lightly barricaded (or worse), due to the enthusiastic use of traits by ravenous zombies.                        </div>

I do really love the notion that you could come back online and your first action could be to say "Jesus on a pogo-stick!  What happened to my HOUSE?  Lenny!  LENNY!  Get your ass over here!"                        </div>

Yes. That's very nice, actually. OK...there should be a way of explaining how you use the trait.<br><br>Yeah, Jason, you're right, it is like that, and that's not what I wanted it to be like. I've played games like that, where you sign in and bash everything else, and I wanted something a bit more narration based.<br/><br/>Will think more.<br/><br/>Other people are welcome to think too.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></div>

In any particular "action" a user takes a trait for a "character" he controls, and uses it to attempt to change the trait of a "character" he doesn't control, along with a bit of narration to explain the connection between the two.<br/>
<br/>
The computer decides whether the attempt succeeds.<br/>

The players decide whether the narration wins the poster more dice.                        </div>

                            This seems to be the common theme with all of this line of thinking...moderation.<br>
<br>
That is, who decides what can be used against what reasonably? I see three options that have emerged:<br>
<br>
1. Anything goes. The problem with this is that we're all, I think rightly, concerned that play may become too "chaotic" if it goes like this. If one player steps out of a sense of complete co-operation, the floodgates could open, and then it's all over. In any case, this would probably feel as flimsy as most freeform. <br>
<br>
2. Hard-coded moderation. Where X can affect Y, and such rules, and nobody can say no to this. The question is, why not simply play a MMORPG? That is, what's unique about TT RPGs is that there's a judge who makes calls on what's suitable, and that opens the world up to larger possibilities than an MMORPG can deal with. So this seems like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. <br/>
<br/>
3. Participant moderated. This is problematic, because, by the definition of the idea, players with an interest in any particular element may not be present to call BS. And having a GM is likely not possible, unless there is a corp of GMs (and even then what if one isn't around). Now we've god Moderated MUDs (MUSH, whaever), essentially. <br/>
<br/>
For Uniwiki, essentially the central authority is between all players moderated with Coins, and was somewhat of a hassle in an essentially asynchronous environment. Though not a completely unusable format. <br/>
<br/>
This seems to be the main problem with this concept is that none of these solutions is optimal. Does anyone have an option that's outside of these three, or a modification of one that would work really well? One that allows for participant judgement, but doesn't require a GM, or asynchronous communication, or a group of privileged individuals who might not be available? <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could recruit neutral third parties somehow? Who would get rewarded for making reasonable judgements? The difficult part here is determining when somebody is actually neutral. Though that might be possible to set mechanically. <br/>

                            Mike, yes, that's the bit that was worrying me too.<br/><br/>What I was thinking of, above, was that you could raise a query (when Tony attacks my "Surrounded by grass" trait with his "Stupid" trait) and that query gets given to three other players at random. They decide whether it's kosher or not.<br/><br/>Of course, that would be rather asynchronous: sometimes a ruling mightn't occur until 24 hours after the event. Perhaps you could use some sort of dreamlike setting to assist this: an Alice-in-Wonderland setting, where you think you attacked a house but, then, you go back the next day and it's all the same.<br/><br/>Or perhaps the ruling wouldn't actually get overturned but, if the three players decide the rule was used badly, the player who was affected gets some resource to spend. Perhaps they get to change a trait back. <br/><br/>(None of this is very satisfying so far, I have to admit.)<br/><br/>The problem for me, so far, is that there's no reason for players to do anything except for go round bashing each others' traits. <br/><br/>There probably needs to be some sort of relationship map. Perhaps characters need objectives as well as traits, in some way. Perhaps other players could be rewarded for responding to other people's objectives: a sort of fan mail thing or payment for doing GM duties.<br/><br/>On a tangent, I'm interested in UniWiki, but I couldn't find it anywhere. Could you give me a link? It seems rather relevant.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

If there's enough players, you could arrange it so that everytime an action comes up, it picks a random player who is a) online, and b) not directly involved as a stakeholder, and asks them to decide if its legit. Or, pick 3 such players and go with how 2 vote or whatever. If nobody's online who isn't involved, it gets queued for the next available moderator. Connect moderating these events as they come to you with an in-game benefit like dice for the moderating player or some other in-game benefit. <br><br>Might that work?<br><br>edit: DOH! neglected to read graham's post in detail where he already says this!                        </br></br></br></br></div>
