This is usually something like the night before you venture out. Setting this point takes at least one hour of focus and meditation. At any point later in an adventure you can spend an awesome point to travel back to that point in time. The trick is you can only exist in that time for a number of hours equal to your Stubbornness, and you can not allow anyone to know that you are from the future, including yourself. After that time is spent, or earlier if desired, you are jumped back to the normal timeline. So if you want to put that extra potion in your bag, you had better not get spotted. Failure to follow any of the restrictions will forcibly jump you back to your normal timeline and erase any actions that you might have completed while in the past. <br/><br/>I challenge you to make a talent that creates some sort of a "Mini Game."

Once per adventure the player can challenge the GM to a round of Ch\u014d-Han. The player can wager as many awesome tokens as he possess. The GM rolls two dice and covers the results. Both the player and the GM yell "Even"or "Odd" at the same time. If the player wins he doubles the amount wagered. If there is a tie, half of the tokens go to the GM. If the player looses, all his awesome tokens go to the GM and the Spirit attacks. The player must fight the Spirit alone, and it can only be defeated with a hit "to the Face". If the player is "lucky" and defeats the Spirit, he regains his tokens plus one. If the player is not victorious, he will be left with a single hp and a single token...<br/>\nThe Spirit should have the power "Entangle", light armor, light weapon and 10 hp...<br/>\n<br/>\nI challenge you to create a talent  for a Cat like humanoid...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335811/#Comment_335811" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T17:17:38+00:00" title="July 23, 2011  5:17PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong>Psychic Targeting</strong></p>\n<p>In any given room, you can always identify the one who is NOT a cat person.
