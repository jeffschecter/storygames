I'm curious about what you think of these. My thinking was that even if they weren't ever used, they serve as a model demonstrating the kind of experience you might be able to find in the playset. I think the Setup is a huge part of the game's fun, personally, so I'd never advise you to use the Insta-Setup if you have time to build your own. So:<br/><br/><b>Have you used an InstaSetup? <br/><br/>If not, do you see its utility or is it redundant? Is it informative or entertaining, even if unused? Or do you skip them?</b><br/><br/>Related question - I've got a set that hinges around a particular epochal historic event, and making certain choices in the Setup will determine whether your game is <i>about </i>that event or just happening at the same time and overlapping in a crazy way. Would you rather:<br/><br/><b>1. Have the "make it about the event" choices flagged in the playset, maybe with a little symbol<br/>2. Have a second Insta-Setup that combines the best choices to hammer home the event<br/>3. Leave it alone</b><br/><br/>Thanks for your thoughts!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262554/#Comment_262554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T13:23:58+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  1:23PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't used an InstaSetup yet.

If there's a playset about Berlin, May 1945 (and really...why isn't there?), I'd want the default location to be Hitler's Bunker, for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262560/#Comment_262560" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T13:41:44+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  1:41PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>I've not played since the final edition came out (shame on me, I know). However, I find myself skipping over the InstaSetup for similar reasons to Chris.<br/><br/>However, I kinda like the idea of having a playset in the vicinity of a major historical event without the story <i>having</i> to be about that event. I think that just leaving it alone and seeing what happens is sufficient. That way, the significance of the event is emergent instead of being programmed.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262563/#Comment_262563" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T13:47:44+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  1:47PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason:<br/><br/>I think the default approach should be to leave out the I.S.U. altogether - it removes one of the most fun aspects of play and will lead to some less-than-fully satisfying gameplay experiences that could be easily avoided.<br/><br/>With the sort of playset you describe, though, an I.S.U. would be undeniably beneficial. <br/><br/>Proposed solution: split your playsets into two different categories, e.g. "Key Event" playsets and "Random Shit" playsets (I'm sure you could think up better names - my kungfu is weak today). For the latter, leave the I.S.U. out entirely; for the former, put one in and include a very short prose narrative describing the event that the I.S.U covers. <br/><br/>P.S. - I'll be running one or possibly two sessions of Fiasco at <a href="http://stillcon.com/" rel="nofollow">Stillcon</a> on March 26th. I'm also working on a homebrewed playset of the "Random Shit" variety based around a small college campus in the Southwest, if you have any use for that sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262567/#Comment_262567" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T14:00:37+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  2:00PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2010 2:05PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark - absolutely!

There's a certain kind of story that happens independently but congruently with some huge event, and is the richer for it.

I could see using the insta-set-up in the future, if we just want to get to screwing our characters over, but at this point my group is loving the whole process of creating the situation. I don't think they were a "step too far" in regards to convenience - in fact it would be very easy to pre-make all the cards for an insta-set-up and just lay them out on the table to share about before the game begins. Have you considered doing some "print and play" cards for the insta-set-ups?<br/>In regards to the historical set-up, I would probably prefer a suggested "default" but still give all the "Random Shit" (nice term!) so that we could replay later with new (screwier?) events.<br/><br/>- Nathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264261/#Comment_264261" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T08:31:08+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  8:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We didn't use the insta-setup, and I never think I will.
