TusCon is a nice little SF relaxacon held in Tucson, AZ..  They have a bit of everything and a nice con suite and they claim that <a href="http://sagagamers.com" rel="nofollow">Southern Arizona Gamers Association</a> is running their game room this year.  While I realize it's not that long after <span style="text-decoration: underline;">RinCon</span>,  I was wondering if any of the Tuscon or Phoenix story gamers (or from anywhere, but TusCon is very local usually) are going to be there this time?  I almost certainly will.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
