I'll often start out with a solid attempt at structure, but as things develop too quickly for me to figure out how to integrate them into that structure, I'll often disregard it more often until I'm just running everything off the cuff. Rather than accurately accounting for player resources or core story-flow mechanics, I just move events along via authoritive narration and intuitive judgement; "winging it" as they say. Note that "structure" here means rules-system more than plot, but both are factors. This bothers me because I always feel like I've screwed-up when I resort to free-forming. Partly, its because it feels like I've lost the structure because I wasn't smart/skillful enough to keep it all in my head. But mainly I think its because free-forming enforces strong central GM authority over player input, and I really don't want my games to be like that. Consensus story-building where my role is just to moderate is what I'm shooting for, and feel like whenever I step in to make it primarily my story, I've screwed up that potential, limitted it to the the bounds of my own weak dramatic skills.<br/><br/>The irony here being that free-forming was once considered a sign of skillful GM'ing; I recall many letters in <i>Dragon</i> magazine proudly declaring, "I'm such a good DM, I don't even need the rules." And my players don't mind at all; I've even been told they like that my games feature so few rules limits. But personally, it gnaws.<br/><br/>So ... is this valid, and does anyone else feel this way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173541/#Comment_173541" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T12:05:05+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 12:05PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoah, several ways to approach that from the off.<br/><br/>First up, your feelings are always valid, and no, you're not the only person.<br/><br/>Secondly, if your group is having fun, then you're having fun, and you shouldn't change for the sake of it. (Side note: I try to avoid referring to "my players" personally when I GM, as that suggests a kind of <i>ownership</i> over people that makes me uncomfortable).<br/><br/>Thirdly, I don't know what rules set or sets you are using (or are nominally using until they're thrown aside and you wing it) when you GM, and it might help to have an idea. I'm of the view that some games are only functional when one "wings it", in the sense of ignoring the textual rules, to at least some extent. Some other games are functional for one particular play style, but require large amounts of "winging it" if you want to achieve a different result.

Or rather, in games where I don't set out to freeform to begin with, I always end up free-forming anyway.<br/><br/>Its probably significant that I nearly exclusively run action-adventure type sessions. The tipping point comes during the first big set-piece, when I want to encourage momentum and spectacle and build up narrative momentum that I don't want to lose. After that, re-connnecting with structure means lost time, so I just keep moving forward by fiat.<br/><br/>The only games I think I managed to stick with the structure with relative consistancey were several <i>T&amp;T</i> adventures many years ago, but I think that's because T&amp;T shamelessly encourages the GM to be adversarial and play to be much more (for lack of another term) wargamey.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>Also, free-forming works very well in de-centralized ways, too.

I liked that implied structure very much. <br/><br/>However, in actual play, I had no sense of how to integrate the evolving narrative flow with that structure. Scenes would start, progress and then end with a need for a declaration of fallout without ever having presented a clear moment for a dice toss. Further, as players accumulated fiat-generated resources from these scenes that had no accounting in the pool mechanic, I was pushed farther away from it until by the last session of the series tossing the dice was really just a timing mechanism and pool size was irrelevent. <br/><br/>I don't think I'm disregarding player input, and would even say I go to pains to keep that input flowing, and encourage discussion about intent and dramatic expectations for every scene. But as free-forming demands that ultimately I be the final arbitrater, it inevitably gives my opinion greater weight.<br/><br/>I think what bugs me most about free-forming is that I feel like I'm abandonning useful tools (the structure) that would make my job easier if only I could keep them in hand.

If I understood your description, you are playing with a strongly centralized GM figure, who play using only "rule zero" deciding every time what happen, if somebody get to do what he wants or not, and what are the results. Right?<br/><br/>And your problem is that you would like more proactive players, adding input that you would like to add to the narration, to avoid the feeling of "deciding everything alone"<br/><br/>(Yes, I know it's not a very nuanced way of describing it. English is not my native language and people already told me that I tend to appear a little blunt when I use it)<br/><br/>The problem is that the kind of play where a centralized GM "rule" using only rule zero tend to provoke from the players a kind of "<a href="http://mearls.livejournal.com/80639.html" rel="nofollow">Mother May I</a>" playing, that is the opposite of what you want. <br/><br/>So, if everybody (including you) is happy... no problem , you are playing right!<br/>But if somebody (even only you) is not happy with that kind of playing, then there is a problem. if you want to pull some more input from your players, you are using the worst technique in the world to do it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173692/#Comment_173692" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T22:53:57+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 10:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Real life has a plot only in retrospect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173789/#Comment_173789" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T08:43:07+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  8:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 8:43AM by Emily_Care.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>But mainly I think its because free-forming enforces strong central GM authority over player input, and I really don't want my games to be like that.</blockquote>I don't think I'm understanding this part. Why do you suddenly go into strong central GM mode once free-forming begins? Why couldn't free forming incorporate player input just as easily as yours as the GM?<br/><br/>This is what I meant by de-centralized. I've done a lot of gaming where we used minimal rules structures, but everyone was giving all kinds of input and there was no central GM. We did this by defining what areas of the world each person had say over (eg I control these characters, groups and places, you control those), and by talking out and discussing outcomes and scene framing as a group.  It was fun, challenging and intensely rewarding, but lacking balance because some of us ended up doing more of certain kinds of things (ie providing adversity) than others. <br/><br/>Also, it seems like freeform is being used to mean "having the GM decide what rules to use and what happens next off the cuff" rather than "not using mechanics".

And my players don't mind at all; I've even been told they like that my games feature so few rules limits. But personally, it gnaws.</blockquote>\nI think there's a fundamental misunderstanding tied to this sentiment of being a good DM, due to not needing the rules. Namely that a good DM abandons the rules, when in fact a good DM manages to fuse the rules and the fiction into one stable whole. <br/><br/>What I mean by that is the idea that a good DM manages to strike just the right balance between following the written rules and following the demands of the fiction (in classic D&amp;D this would probably include standards of "realism" and "plausible physics" etc.). Or put differently a good DM knows when to ignore the written rules in favour of the fiction, and when to stick to them regardless of how unfortunate the outcome for the characters will be.<br/><br/>This type of DM-skill is still (and I think always will be) considered a great asset to any gaming group. This kind of free-form improves pretty much every roleplaying game. It's the kind of unstructured, "make it up as you go and my idea is subject to nothing and nobody"-type of improvisation that feels hollow and unsatisfying. It's like eating nothing but chocolate cake all day. Sure it tastes great, but at some point you want something with a bit more meat to it. The assumption is, that if you only stick to the rules more closely, your game will be meatier. But then you might be stuck with an unweildy Frankenstein monster of a rules-block, that you're trying control before it completely derails your game into pure number-crunching and rules-talk (and I'm partly channeling my D&amp;D 3.x experiences here). <br/><br/>What one needs to do, I think, is to take a close look at the fiction, figure out what qualities are important to you and make sure to treat them as solid, unmovable pillars of the game. If you're into thematic content, make sure everything you free-form ties into the ongoing theme. If you're into character focus, make sure that all characters act consistently and logically. If you're into enviromental challenges, make sure that you're setting is plausible, realistic and probable. etc. etc. Treat the fiction (or rather the important elements of it) the way you'd treat the rules, and free-forming shouldn't feel like a failure.<br/><br/><br/>(Of course.. I might just be talking complete horse radish again.<br/>Having re-read the thread... I realise that I am. Never mind, then.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
