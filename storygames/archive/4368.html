The conversation went something like this:<br/><br/>Eric: I want to run a genuine 3-session The Mountain Witch game again. Not a 1-session one. You need 3 sessions, I think, for it to be the best game it can be.<br/>Eric and Lisa begin to talk about a 2-year game of MAGE that Eric ran and Lisa and others played in: The game lasted two years (1-2 sessions a week). They had some really gripping moments. Lots of attachment to characters, both their own and other NPCs.  However, they also realized that there was a lot of BS in those 2 years that didn't need to be there.<br/><br/>My question, that Eric was thinking about: "Is it possible to (after ejecting "BS", whatever that BS means) run say a mini-campaign for a few months (say 6-8+ sessions) where you can get that same level of attachment as the 1-2 year games?"<br/><br/>Now, when I say attachment, I'm thinking of games with a <b>heavy social component</b>. Basically, World of Darkness stuff and games played out like that (AMBER, etc). Not just all "4 guys who adventure together and get minimal face-time".<br/><br/>Eric's answer was: "Yes. But I'll have to think about why". I'm hoping he'll jump in later with some ideas.<br/><br/>What are your ideas?  Tricks (system independent) to get more attachment to the game without playing for 2 years?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98620/#Comment_98620" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:12:50+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:12AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my small idea, which kind of worked for a 6-7 session PTA game that I ran (and if I knew then what I know now, I would have aimed for 10 sessions):<br/><br/>Make a relationship map. Have about 6 major NPCs, including protagonists (4-5) and antagonists (1-2 : And these are "rivals", not "must kill them at every opportunity"). Through the early game, tie each player to 1-2 of them.  If more NPCs need to be created, do so sparingly.<br/><br/>Finally, let the Players sometimes take the roles of the NPCs if their PC is not in the scene.<br/><br/>This helped create a situation where the NPCs felt important and really took on a history of their own. The players became attached to them. Then, kinda like a feedback loop, their attachment to their own players grew because of what they did with/to the NPCs.  I feel like this condensed a lot of time into more juicy, poignant roleplaying moments.<br/><br/>Perhaps the "let players roleplay the parts of the NPCs sometimes" was key, even when the GM had specific plans for those NPCs.  Sort of that "my character" feel, but it extends to NPCs?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98624/#Comment_98624" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:15:30+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really a question about emergent properties, and so much of it is tied up in preferences that have nothing to do with the game that it's impossible to answer.<br/><br/>I remember a Star Wars d6 game of three years with immense fondness but objectively it has as much to do with the time of my life that I'm recalling as it does with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98626/#Comment_98626" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:19:17+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 10:20AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess one question to start off with is:  how often do you play?  My group plays every other week, so a 6-8 month campaign is much different from, say, a two year campaign with a group that meets weekly.<br/><br/>With the above game, that's around, what, at least 100 sessions?  My group's typical campaign length ranges from four sessions for on GM to eight sessions for me.  I'm not sure what I can do to make my game feel like it has the investment of a game that's at least twelve times longer.<br/><br/>Maybe twice as long with "homework", which I've done with a couple games:<br/>* A GURPS Black Ops game where I asked the players to write up After-Action Reviews.

I have much fondness for a lot of AD&amp;D 2E long-running games back in HS and college, that, on further reflection, would probably bore me to tears these days.<br/><br/>And yet, I think that there's perhaps something that can be done to streamline the Character Connection without having to play for two years. I mean, nowadays we have games that are at their core focused on that kind of thing (My Life with Master, Polaris, etc): I guess the trick would be to play those regularly and not for 2-3 sessions and stopping...<br/><br/>Still, any ideas are good.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98634/#Comment_98634" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:24:33+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Maybe twice as long with "homework", which I've done with a couple games:<br/>* A GURPS Black Ops game where I asked the players to write up After-Action Reviews.

This is something that I've been thinking about a lot and is somewhat topical to our gaming group. We don't really play short games per se and when we do aim for more concise stuff our shortest tends to be around half a year, once every week. We like it and it works well, so there's no real problem, but I wouldn't mind trying some really short term games.<br/><br/>I think framing straight to the point is key and making the characters intimate with the premise. Very often these long games start by meandering about for long times, looking to create connection to characters and to hook in the characters to the premise. I think both of these should just be assumed. When we started framing tighter, I found - perhaps not surprisingly - the campaigns got shorter from the norm, with nothing much lost in the character department.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98641/#Comment_98641" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:35:08+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:35AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Ahhhh.

For some players it's just preference - they like to build up from scratch - but I think for many it's more about not having strong situation-creation tools and/or tools for making strong <b>characters</b> (as opposed to bundles of mechanical person-model).

Create main characters and give them motivating attributes that link to the themes and entities.<br/>   4. Create supporting characters that are connected to the main characters and that put a face on the entities. Probably do this with an R-map. Make sure you build in some conflict (\xe2\u20ac\x9dfamily is important to me, I hate heretics, my brother-in-law is a heretic\xe2\u20ac\x9d).<br/>   5. Add motivating attributes to the main characters which connect them to the supporting characters.<br/>   6. Create some situations, as gateways, which will act as \xe2\u20ac\u0153inciting incidents\xe2\u20ac\x9d to the main characters you have - features of the world-as-it-is that they can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t ignore but will need to try to change, just because of who they are. Make sure, as well, that the things that can bring about change are things the characters are uniquely equipped to do.<br/>   7. Engaging, conflict-filled gameplay ensues.

But some games---well, with them I'm like Bret. So it may not be *all* about the player.<br/><br/>I've been noticing that I feel the best connection with characters when they are connected with the other characters, as with Rob's and yours and other suggestions here--as well as well placed in the story. We've been playing In a Wicked Age..lately which requires switching characters each week (mostly). This can be hard for me--it often takes me a couple weeks to get into character, if I"m lucky! But having the interests in IaW/AGG, which puts the characters at odds with/allied with one another, as well as being tied in to the flow of the story and with strong motivation and opposition, gives me a much stronger experience of character.<br/><br/>PtA works much better for me as well. For similar reasons.<br/><br/>But, player does matter. I suspect, people look for different things too. Sometimes the fanfic/canon approach is what people are looking for. A character doesn't feel real unless they sit among a well-realized world with looots of connections. I know people who require that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104092/#Comment_104092" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T21:53:19+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  9:53PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to resurrect an old thread, but...<br/><br/>I was wondering if Tony might answer a question. I am intrigued by this bit you wrote, Tony:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>This'll sound so minor as to be inane, but ... well, it gets results: Have PC A express an opinion about the type of person PC B is, and then have the player for PC B have to decide whether they want their character to be that kind of person or not. Make sure this kind of exchange is happening at least once every five minutes or so.<br/><br/>My experience is that you can get tight "Oh my God I am<em>tight</em>with this character, I love them and want to see them happy," connections in one or two one-hour sessions. I don't know quite why it works, but I've had really good results.</blockquote>\nSo, just how can you "make sure this kind of exchange is happening at least every five minutes"? What techniques, mechanics, etc, have you found useful? And <i>who</i> makes sure it is happening?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104093/#Comment_104093" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T22:14:43+00:00" title="October 21, 2007 10:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I don't want to resurrect an old thread, but...</blockquote>\nJust note: Here, thread resurrection isn't just allowed, it's<i> totally encouraged</i>.

And<i>who</i>makes sure it is happening?</blockquote>One rules-build that works pretty well is this:  If you use one of your own dice for your own purposes (succeeding at a narration, usually) then it goes into a discard pile.  From that discard pile, it can <i>never</i> go back into your own hand ... you can only hand it out to someone else by expressing an opinion about their character.  When that person then uses your die, it doesn't go to their discard pile, it comes back to you.  PLUS, you get some input into their narration if they succeed.<br/><br/>The little circle of that economy (Yours -&gt; Discard -&gt; Opinion -&gt; Yours) tends to get people expressing opinions pretty quickly, of necessity.  Otherwise they just plain run out of dice.<br/><br/>There are other ways to do it, motivated through different channels (opportunity vs. necessity, for instance) but this is a nice, simple one that gets the point across quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
