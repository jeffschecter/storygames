They're lending you their service in trade for your promise to let them use what you contribute in any way they want, forever, at no cost to them. But it's still <i>yours</i>; that's why they're asking you for the rights to use it. This is an important point, because it means that <i>you</i> retain the rights to use your User Content as well (you can make a book out of your Gleemax postings and sell it, as long as you don't step on other people's IP). If WotC actually claimed your User Content as theirs, and you agreed to hand over those rights, you'd be unable to do that. (Rather like IP contracts that some companies put into their employment contracts.)<br/><br/>You may say, "why would I ever want to do that"? But if you were someone like, say, Kenneth Hite, who used blogs as a forum to wax rhapsodic on various and sundry gamey and literary topics, you might indeed find that there might be a market for a book of your all your blog posts, especially if that book contained posts related to weird history for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97095/#Comment_97095" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T06:46:33+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  6:46AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's still a concern.

So, if some asshat posts even direct rules quotes or images from Do, WotC would <b>not</b> have the right to use that material as "User Content" under the above terms.

Here's a neat law-school-exam-style hypothetical:<br/><br/>I micro-publish (i.e., very low print run) a very cool new rule that's suitable for d20 but is appropriately not released under the OGL. This publication flies under the radar of just about everybody. A random consumer posts the rule to Gleemax claiming it is his own. WotC likes the rule and decides to include it in their next big shiny supplement. (Maybe they even contact random consumer who lies and says it reall was his.) On publication, I find out about it. Now I get to right a very nasty cease-and-desist letter to WotC. And WotC's remedy? Probably nothing more than an indemnity action against random consumer, which, given the typical random game consumer, wouldn't be worth much more than the paper the judgment is printed on.<br/><br/>It's like revenge fantasy for indie publishers.<br/><br/>It also highlights the pitfalls of publishing derivative works based off of on-line posts and reinforces the idea that it likely is nothing more than CYA and that WotC actually has no intention of actually mining Gleemax for content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97151/#Comment_97151" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T09:41:09+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  9:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is good information to know.

So, since you aren't the owner or rights-holder of an image that some artist has done for you to use in your game (presuming you've only bought reproduction rights in the context of your game and advertising, say), you can't grant rights to anyone, and the whole clause is inapplicable.

If you write something and I write something and they are similar and you can prove that I did in fact, read what you wrote, you might use that to claim I stole your ideas. This doesn't happen so much in gaming because of the unique position of game rules (rules can't be copyrighted, expressions of rules can) and because there's just not as much money in it, but gaming -- and WotC -- is more than just rules expressions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116890/#Comment_116890" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T15:26:36+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  3:26PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't be the only one who thinks Gleemax sounds like a floor cleaner, can I?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116950/#Comment_116950" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T23:03:56+00:00" title="December 28, 2007 11:03PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not the name, really, is the design of the place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
