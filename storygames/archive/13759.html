He then printed out Ember -- a blank specializing in flood/bleeding -- and had Ember manipulate the memories of Anthula -- a FOB immigrant to the station and switching specialist -- convincing Anthula that i0tA was her cousin.  The group then formed a new "social impact mitigation" MRCZ called Black Lotus. They are out for revenge (well, mostly).<br/><br/><b>First Session:</b> Black Lotus has been forced to share an old, burnt out communications pod with Big Wood, another tier 1 MRCZ that's into retro-phile timber sports. Big Wood is cultivating a patch of redwoods in the middle of the pod, but Black Lotus wins the first challenge and collectively convince their cultivator, Gemma9, to leave the trees unattended and come to this posh club Borealis with them. Gemma9 quickly gets bored and recruits Anthula to go watch chain-sabre bloodsports instead. <br/><br/>Ember delivers a memory of herself having sex with the video contortionist of Solo Express, the band MRCZ that plays at Borealis, to a rabid fan and, as the delivery is taking place, i0tA attempts to thin-slice the memory to gain data and create a new fad about sex-by-proxy. Due to i0tA's unconscious desire to make the sex memory even better than it already was, with spinning camera effects, they are only somewhat successful and get away with just the data, no fad.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Anthula ghosts Gemma9 when the cultivator tries to sign them both up to participate in chain-sabre fencing. The ghosting is so successful that it seems as if it's all just a big misunderstanding, even though the whole bloodsport arena erupts in chaos, with the audience and sabre-wielding maniacs intermingling. Anthula also makes off with the climbing gear -- the only way down into the machine tunnels where the bloodsports are held -- trapping the violent crowd inside. <br/><br/>Back topside, i0tA meets with Winslow, a negotiator for the tier 4 MRCZ Scarlet Studies, who run a "murder-based marketing" service where they arrange for people to be mysteriously killed in other MRCZs workspaces, driving traffic and attention there when various investigator MRCZs show up and try to solve the crime. i0tA gambles and asks about "the job that you did for Pithy" (the name of his previous MRCZ and all the info he currently has about his own death). Winslow says that, yes, they arranged that job and that "the body" is still on display in Pithy's workspace, in case Black Lotus wants to stop by and get a better sense of the kind of work that Scarlet Studies' does. i0tA and the team decide to go there right away, but first destroy Winslow in a group shaping challenge to discover his long-term memories, some of which have to do with a previous botched job in which Scarlet Studies killed the wrong person due to switching.<br/><br/>Can't wait for session 2 and the crime scene this week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311549/#Comment_311549" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T15:24:59+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  3:24PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 3:25PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Freemarket game was soooo good.<br/><br/>We won the last challenge by a lot (margin 5, I think), but still: paying 25 flow up front to even attempt it made the whole thing a real nail-biter.

Pithy's old workspace is in a condemned airlock and Winslow gives them a brief tour to show off Scarlet Studies' quality products: arranged murders for marketing purposes.  Sure enough, a Tier 1 investigation MRCZ, I Spy, is there inspecting i0tA's corpse.<br/><br/>Black Lotus wins a collective Breaking challenge and gets 6 Data from the crime scene, besting the Ghosting ability of a professional assassin who was very careful to cover his tracks.  Apparently he slipped in through a maintenance trapdoor from outside the station -- out in space -- and emerged from underneath a table with a birthday cake on it -- Pithy's last and unfinished trend-setting campaign was called "Guess What? Birthday Surprise!" -- to blow up i0tA's head with some kind of explosive round.<br/><br/>i0tA reveals his identity as the victim to Zott, the founder of I Spy and arranges to meet her later.  Anthula and Ember return to Black Lotus' personal workspace to try to get rid of their annoying neighbors, the retro-phile timber sports MRCZ Big Wood, but discover that their whole pod cluster was "spaced" (containment failed and the contents were vacuumed into the void). They head for the temporary housing assigned to them by the Aggregate -- while it re-stabilizes their wing -- but are concerned that this is yet another attempt to kill i0tA, so they share a Ghosting challenge to try to case their new place and catch whoever's after them. Due to some bad draws, they just barely lose the conflict and a Scarlet Studies' operative manages to sneak in and leave a note on i0tA's cot warning him that investigating his own death is a breach of contract and that he should desist immediately.<br/><br/>i0tA meets with Zott in club Borealis (from session 1) and again, just barely loses a Negotiation challenge to get her to act as his eyes and ears in the investigation, since he's not contractually allowed to be involved.  Zott agrees, but insists that i0tA personally introduce her to every former member of Pithy, folks that i0tA isn't keen to meet, since he suspects they might be responsible for his death.<br/><br/>Anthula watches a vmail from her mom on earth, telling her that she should check in with her uncle Macarios.  She tracks him down and discovers that he runs a "import-export" MRCZ, bringing in weird tech from off-station. Anthula says that she might need the family (in the classic gangster sense) to become involved, since she doesn't necessarily agree with the way that i0tA is running this mission of revenge. After all, i0tA is family (or Anthula has been manipulated to believe so) and family take care of their own.  "Is that Benny's kid?" Macarios asks, but he seems very willing to become involved as needed.<br/><br/>Whew!<br/><br/>Next session, Anthula's going to get a space suit and go investigate what happened to their pod. i0tA's probably going to introduce Zott around. Ember might start tracking down the assassin. And surely Macarios will try to channel some business towards his neice's new MRCZ, right?  Oh yeah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312260/#Comment_312260" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-11T14:54:04+00:00" title="February 11, 2011  2:54PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2011 2:54PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Did you get<i>incest</i>?

His hubris grew with every success of escaping the law and in the end drew him to a much premature attempt at heroicity.

The parents association had been raising money for a new sports field, the principal Jonathan Bwaithwait III had been using the money to make shady investments with Luigi, the local bookie/accountant. But now Clarice the town planner was calling in money for a deposit on the land.<br/>\nOn the other side of town we have Bob the local ex-Jock trying to sell off his worthless land, and Bruce the indebted gambler, running a Cattery trying to get out of his debts to Luigi.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is much finangling and trickery by Luigi, which ends up with Johnathan not getting the money for the embezzled investments, purchasing the cheap land from Bob through Luigi's accountancy firm, Clarice loosing her paperwork for the original purchase of the new sportsground, and Bruce getting into a plan with Johnathan to take Luigi to the cleaners.... <br/>\n<br/>\nthen the Tilt arrives.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all goes spectacularly downhill, with Bruce convincing Bob to get the money in cash from Luigi, Clarice getting photos of the handover and finding records of Luigi's misdeeds, and then Johnathan screwing up the holdup and ending up in Bob's basement, hog tied.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, Bruce manages to get out of debt by selling his Cattery to Luigi's brother Mario in Saudi Arabia (minus proper vaccinations, which leads to a huge plague killing hundreds). Luigi was actually a Fed, but Clarice uncovers all his misdeeds and he kills himself while leaving his final evidence fingering Clarice as the Mastermind. Bob ends up doing hard time in the state prison for assault, kidnapping and torture. While Johnathan ends up with his name cleared, all the cash, a fat pension from the school, and Bob's wife who fell in love with him during his imprisonment in the basement...<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all a hilarious fiasco, and a great game had by all :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gravity" title="gravity"><img alt="gravity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gravity">gravity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312999/#Comment_312999" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T01:36:43+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  1:36AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Apocalypse World. </b>The careless and independent, some would say cold-hearted, Driver arrives with his crew at the hardhold of the degenerate slave trader. After short introductions the Driver starts his wheeling and dealing: he wants to hire an electrician of some sorts. The player fails his <b>read a person</b> roll and I, the MC, turn the move back at him: "How could I get you to give me that intriguing girl" and the slave trader means the girl the Driver has picked up along the way and who he just a couple of hours ago promised to take care of and protect. The player is delightfully troubled but in the end the Driver shrugs and is like, "give me the electrician and the girl is yours". She is kicking and screaming carried off the stage by two of the slave traders thugs.  <br/><br/>Right afterwards, just outside the slave traders court, another member of the Drivers crew, a young boy who is the Driver's groopie, confronts the Driver. "How could you do that? You are not the great man I thought you were" The Driver is worried that the boy will tell one of the other PCs (the Angel, who is a lot less callous and who also wanted the girl protected) and tries to <b>manipulate</b> him: "Boy, we are real friends and real friends look after each other. That girl, she was just a nobody, but we, we got to stick together. Real friends don't tell on each other" kinda thing. And he fails again, and I turn the move back at him, again! The boy freaks out, for the first time ever he raises his voice: "If you don't get the girl back - buy her, rescue her, whatever - right now, not only will I tell your friend, but I will raise hell with everyone when we get back and let everyone know what a selfish, mean and trecherous arsehole you are!" If I ever need a reminder why I play RPGs, I shall remember the waves of pain and pleasure on the Driver's player's face at that moment. <br/><br/>I love AW when 1) the moves snowball out of control and 2) the system lubricates the conversation into total awesomeness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313000/#Comment_313000" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T01:46:15+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  1:46AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2011 4:11PM by johnzo.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>D&amp;D4E.</b>  The Crimson Blades' blitzenwhal is infected by an infernal chain parasite, an exile from the Nine Hells!<br/><br/>Undaunted, our heroes calmly cross-connect the warlord's teleportation daily to the blitzenwhal's blitzenjumpen.

It doesn't help that next mission, they take the face of Selene and her equally dead Anchor. Providing a diversion for fellow Pilot Tamara (played by my wife Annie) to move in and place a dream-wave inhibitor device, Mark revels in going apeshit on the aliens, slaughtering them and hurling them into the dreamwave singularity Tamara's device has caused.<br/><br/>Afterward Mark comes to Tamara's room; he's had a thing for her since forever. Stuck for small talk, he unloads about his dead sister and how much he wants to get those alien fuckers and end the war. He doesn't want anyone else to die; he wants to protect everyone. He moves close to Tamara and and continues, "Out on that mission I finally realized my purpose--to <i>protect you</i>." And he moves in and awkwardly plants a kiss.<br/><br/>Embarrassed by the lack of reciprocation, Mark retreats, passing Tamara's Anchor and best friend Lisa. Lisa and Tamara talk and roll their eyes like, y'know, <i>boys</i>, and how Mark needs a girlfriend or some porn or soemthing to screw his head on straight. The next day she passes Mark in the hall and she's all "Hey, BUDDY, are you feeling better? Oh, that's good to hear, you just hang in there, PAL. I'm so glad to be your friend!" and goes whistling on her way with a platonic hug, leaving Mark crushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All the guys at the table was groaning in exquisite agony.
