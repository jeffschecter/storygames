I got chased by a dalek called Clive, nearly got into a bitching contest with some Polish Lancers, avoided spending 'Money You Cannot Afford' on loads of really cool minatures, sadly crumbled under the pressure and spent 'Money You Cannot Afford' on Nine World and two copies of Shadow of Yesterday (one for me, one for one of the gang back home) and generally lapped up all of the gaming goodness.

That's because there was a wide mix of card gamers, wargamers, board game enthusiasts as well as role-palyers there. D&amp;D4e was getting a lot of play and they had a Living Dungeon too.

Many thanks to everyone who submitted to Amateur Interview Hour (and with Gregor "hour" was almost right! Hadn't realised I was monopolising so much of his time) the fruits of which should start to appear shortly. Hal, ex-pat mastermind behind RPGMP3.com, is putting the first podcast episode together this week and should be including some interview material, although I'm not sure whose: he may decide to group all of the Collective interviews together, or string them out over subsequent fortnightly podcasts.<br/><br/>As expected I spent more than I hoped (Dave Blewer sold me on "Sundered Skies," Gregor sold me on "Solipsist" and it was all I could do to resist "Traveller" after interviewing Matthew Sprange... I really need to firm up my willpower) and indeed the only reason I didn't buy "Covenant" was a serious lack of cash and the knowledge that my local store has copies, so it'll have to wait until payday. The "Living Dungeon" event was interesting (Yog-Sothoth.com has posted edited video highlights) and the Stromtroopers and "Doctor" added a lot of interest for kids. The atmosphere was excellent. My only regret was having to cancel a couple of games in order to fulfil my podcasting commitments.
