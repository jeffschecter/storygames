                    Right then, this all started because of this thread <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1380&amp;page=1#Item_36" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/>
<br/>
I'm going to try and put together a game for "intimate online roleplaying". God help me.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the pitch repeated:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Onexone â€“ the online roleplaying game</b><br/>
<br/>
What's this game about?<br/>
<br/>
First up, a warning â€“ this is not a â€œDungeons and Dragonsâ€ type of roleplaying. <i>onexone</i> is a simple set of rules for facilitating intimate communication between two people over the internet. This can be anything from shared erotic story-telling to out-and-out â€œcyberingâ€<br/>
<br/>
Why have rules at all?<br/>
<br/>
Because there's a lot of people out there on the internet, and not all of them like to play the same way. <i>onexone</i> helps you to identify early whether the person you are chatting to is going to be into the same stuff as you, and also helps you to build intimacy as slowly (or quickly!) as you are both comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
Things I think I'm going to need next:<br/>
<br/>
A bit of advice on irc and other types of online communication<br/>
How to set up a profile that tells potential "playmates" what you're interested/not interested in (Flags!)<br/>
Who gets to tell the story? (ie rules for narrative authority)<br/>
Setting the mood (theme)<br/>
How to give and receive feedback without disrupting the flow of the game<br/>
Rules for escalating and de-escalating intimacy (pacing)<br/>
Specific rules for "touching" (narrative authority over the other character, and pacing again)<br/>
When is the game over?<br/>
<br/>
Please add suggestions, cheers and catcalls. I'm serious about doing this, but that doesn't mean we can't have a good laugh about it at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
And I think Kuma should playtest this - if I meet his challenge, he has to meet mine, right?                </div>

<br/>
Here's another chunk of text, comments welcome. Setting the right tone for this is <i>hard</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Who tells the story?</b><br/>
<br/>
A onexone encounter isn't just about getting it on â€“ it's <i>interactive erotic fiction</i>. This means that each participant gets to build a story and experience it at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Not all roleplay has to be this way. For example, one person could just do all the talking while the other person listens. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's a bit like reading fanfic, or watching live performance art.<br/>
<br/>
However, this author believes that it's more fun when two people are building the story together, each adding elements to complement, surprise and titillate the other participant. Does that remind you of something?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the problem with two people trying to tell the same story is that it's quite hard to  get into each other's rhythm and come up with stuff that 'fits' with the other person's vision of what should be going on in the story. It's like the difference between a rehearsed song and a jam session.<br/>
<br/>
The <i>onexone</i> rules are there to help you to build this story together. How does that work?<br/>
<br/>
They allow each person to give little â€œcuesâ€ to the other, that lets them know whether they're enjoying each other's contribution.<br/>
They help both people to know who is responsible for speaking next, without having to step outside the experience and ask â€œwho's turn is it?â€<br/>
They let you send clear messages about when to slow down (or speed up) the intimacy of the encounter, without stepping outside the story itself. This is a big deal, especially when you're with someone you haven't played with much before.                        </div>

                            Jason: It hink there's a helluva interesting question here. Would this game appeal to an existing audience, or create a new one? Assuming it works at all, that is. I'm working on the bit about setting up a profile right now, I'll try and finish it before I go watch <i>Lost</i> with Claire (my gf, whi I have just told that I am designing an erotic RPG, and who didn't bat an eyelid.

                            That's <i>great</i> news - I was feeling rather nervous about trying to 'cold-call' for prospective playtesters! I would also really value early comments on whether I'm hitting the right mood for people who may be interested, if there is any way of arranging this. (I'm happy to pass on email details for private feedback, for example.)<br/>
<br/>
Here's a bit about profiles:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Setting up a profile</b><br/>
<br/>
In order to play <i>onexone</i> you're going to need to find another person. Setting up a <i>profile</i> helps you to do that, as well as make sure that you find the <i>right</i> other person.<br/>
<br/>
What's a profile? It's just like an â€œabout meâ€ page, like you would find on someone's home page or 'blog, except it's specifically about how you want to play and how you want people  to treat you while you play.<br/>
<br/>
The big thing about a <i>onexone</i> profile is that it doesn't have to be about the â€œrealâ€ you that gets up each morning, eats breakfast and does whatever it is you do everyday when you're not online. It's about the you that you want to be when you're playing <i>onexone</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What should be in a profile?</b><br/>
<br/>
A profile should contain:<br/>
<br/>
- A name that other people can call you by. Unless you are very comfortable with everyone you know finding out that you roleplay on line, it's a really good idea for this to be different to your real name! Also, pretending to be someone else you know isn't cool.<br/>
<br/>
- Things about your online persona that you do not want to change in order to play the game. For example, if it is very important to your enjoyment of the roleplay that you are a bi male with dark hair and piercing blue eyes, then put it here<br/>
<br/>
- A list of the types of roleplay <i>situations</i> that you enjoy. For example, â€œPrince Charming and Beautiful Princessâ€ is a situation. â€œJane Austen costume dramaâ€ is another situation. â€œSlave girl and captorâ€ is a totally different situation. A good situation conveys as much information to the other player about the mood and setting that you want to achieve when you are doing that sort of roleplay. So, don't be afraid to reference specific stories (books, TV shows, films) if that's the exact experience you want to roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
- A good idea of how intimate you want the experience to get. This could be anything from 'holding hands and exchanging smouldering glances, but nothing physical' to 'no holds barred'. This doesn't mean that you <i>have</i> to go that far every time you play, and <i>onexone</i> will give you ways of politely saying when it's OK to go further, or when you don't want to go there at all. If there is something that you really don't want to do (especially descriptions of specific sexual acts) then you should make sure that's clearly in your profile.<br/>
<br/>
(EDIT: adding this<br/>
<br/>
- How someone can contact you if they are interested in playing the game. This should be a private 'message box' such as an email account, an instant messenger account or any other private messaging system. The author does not recommend giving out telephone numbers and real-world addresses over the internet.)<br/>
<br/>
One of the most important rules of playing <i>onexone</i> is that you must respect each other's profile.                        </div>

                            It looks like I have a new forum to lurk in, thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the last bit I've done for tonight, before I go to bed. It's basically an adapted "playing on purpose" statement. I fully expect to have to revise this after more research, as I'm operating with some real assumptions about how these games work. Please pick this apart if you can:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Setting up a game</b><br/>
<br/>
Once you've found another person to play with (either through finding someone's profile and contacting them, or by finding someone you already know who wants to play with you, you should work out some details with each other before you play through an encounter.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Basic organising stuff</i><br/>
<br/>
Before you even decide what sort of story you'll be playing through, you need to check each other's diaries. The things you need to know straight away are:<br/>
<br/>
When you'll both be free to play;<br/>
How much time you can play for;<br/>
Whether you just want a single play â€œsessionâ€ or whether you are interested in playing over several sessions with breaks in between (for example, once a week for three weeks)<br/>
What you'll be using to talk to each other. For example, a private chatroom, instant messenger or (for slower, more considered stories) email or a private webforum.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't really any different from setting up a meeting, in real life â€“ which also means that you need to be polite and turn up on time, or at least let the other person know if you're going to be late (or, if you need to change plans.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>Preparing the encounter</i><br/>
<br/>
This is the really fun bit. It's like picking which movie you want to go see together. Unless you've both got very narrow preferences (from your profiles) for the type of roleplay you enjoy, you need to pick the type of game you want to play in this particular encounter.<br/>
<br/>
Why choose in advance? Like nearly any other activity, a bit of planning is really useful if you're going to enjoy yourselves properly. You don't have to do this days in advance, but it's really important to know <i>before you play</i> what sort of situation and comfort levels you're playing with. The time you spend on this will pay itself back with a better roleplay experience.<br/>
<br/>
Things you really need to know in advance include:<br/>
<br/>
The basic situation you'll be playing out. This includes the setting, and any major story or roleplay elements that you both want to introduce<br/>
Whether you prefer to play from a fairly 'fixed' script, or whether it's more fun to add lots of new elements as you go along. Anything you do need 'fixed' should also be agreed before play.<br/>
Anything that you do not want to explore in this encounter. This is not the same as just checking each other's profile. For example, you may sometimes be willing to roleplay certain types of activity, but that doesn't mean you want to do it every time. Checking this now could save a lot of disappointment (or grief) later!<br/>
Any <i>codes</i> you want to use. The most common example of a code is a â€œsafeâ€ word or phrase that means â€œplease stop, I am not comfortableâ€. You may also need an â€œemergencyâ€ code that means that you have to stop playing and go AFK (away from keyboard). Sometimes the outside world is going to get in the way, and being able to quickly communicate this means that the other person is left sitting there wondering whether you're â€œplaying silent.â€<br/>
For internet relay chat and similar mediums, whether it's OK to log the discussion to read again afterwards. (Obviously, this is a trust thing. If you have real issues with anyone saving a record of your conversation, then you should ensure that you are playing wth someone you trust absolutely to respect this.)                        </div>

                            Wow--way to pick up the gauntlet, man.  I like the way you are making the game itself an introduction to the community involved (etiquette, etc.).  So, far it *seems* like the sort of thing others already in the community might want to use to introduce new people to its conventions.                        </div>

                            Doug,<br><br>It sounds like the Breaking The Ice online engine works in a similar way to what you're thinking. There's two participants and they communicate however they like (voicechat, IM) and they use a web page to roll dice, handle character sheets and so on. The whole thing's backed with a database that contains details about the game.<br><br>Significantly, there's also a thing in for handling users. At the moment, it doesn't do much: I type in my username and the way people should get in touch with me; you log on to a web page and see me waiting to play; you invite me to play; I accept your invitation; and we start a game. <br><br>Like I say, it's fairly basic, but it'd be <i>really</i> easy to do something similar, with a few extra fields for flags and "interests". When you saw I was waiting to play, you'd be able to see my flags and decide whether you were interested.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I've played similar games, but in PBEM rather than IRC or chat.  Generally, these games had a theme, either general or specific (e.g., a general theme might be "superheroes", while a specific one might be "college students staying at this resort").  They've generally been multiplayer, rather than just two-player, but most "scenes" wound up being one-on-one.<br><br>For those games, the "character sheets" were in part advertising for what you wanted.  Thus, they had sections for listing anything your character was "in to", and for listing things that you did [b]not[/b] want to participate in.  This made it much easier to pick who to approach for scenes, since if you didn't feel like doing X [i]in this game[/i], you could simply put that down for that character.  Or if you wanted one character who had different kinks from another, that was easily possible as well.                        </br></br></div>

                            Graham: That sounds very interesting indeed. I'll admit that I think it is easier (in the case of the project I'm working on) to exploit existing and familiar playing resources (basic IRC, play-by-post) and networking resources (internet homepages, profiles, 'blogs) than design with specific game-assisting technology in mind. But I'm sure that the communication challenges are the same, and that there are a lot of things I can learn from what you're already doing with the BTI engine.<br/>
<br/>
(I also now have no excuse whatsoever for not picking up a copy of BTI. It's research material now, dammit.)<br/>
<br/>
efindel: I find it absolutely fascinating that for all the recent (last few months?) theory discussions about Flags and character sheets, that there are large numbers of people who are quite cheerfully and transparently using "character sheets" as a clear expression of what they want to get from their roleplaying experiences, and have almost certainly been doing so for a long time before we ever thought about it, and they've been doing it to <i>get it on</i>* with each other online.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that lust, not necessity, is the true mother of invention.<br/>
<br/>
* This is not intended as mockery - I think it's brilliant, with a small helping of hilarious (we've been looking in the wrong place for our game design research, people!)                        </div>

<br/>
On a more general note, I'm beginning to think that for this project to be any value, I'm going to have to step beyond the procedural stuff and actually talk about <i>how to write erotic fiction</i>. That's a direction I hadn't thought out fully at the time... oh well, too late to back out now, there's my honour at stake!<br/>

                            OK, here is a tentative Power 19 for the "game" (I'm beginning to think of this project less as a game, and more like <i>The Joy of Cybersex</i>!) I've been doing a lot of thinking and scribbling towards getting some actual rules together, but I'm still a fair way from having something ready yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is your game about?<br/>
Sex and/or romance<br/>
<br/>
What do the characters do?<br/>
They meet, become attracted to each other and engage in romantic and/or sexual behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?<br/>
They create shared romantic/erotic fiction through online chat. They also get aroused. There is no GM, and only two players.<br/>
<br/>
How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about? There is no defined setting. This reinforces that the primary goal of the game is player arousal.<br/>
<br/>
How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about? Character creation is descriptive and only limited by the wishes of the players. The reinforces the wish-fulfillment aspect of the game.<br/>
<br/>
What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)? The reward system of the game is based solely on player feedback.<br/>
<br/>
How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?<br/>
Player feedback.<br/>
<br/>
How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?<br/>
Each player has primary authority over a single character, and shared authority over the rest of the game. However, there is an important section of the rules to support negotiating authority for each other's character.<br/>
<br/>
What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)<br/>
If the prospect of sexual arousal isn't enough to get your attention, then this game isn't for you.<br/>
<br/>
What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?<br/>
Minimal. The â€œmechanicsâ€ as such are actually tools to help players mutually narrate, pace and give feedback to each other, as well as a heap of Social Contract advice.<br/>
<br/>
How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?<br/>
See previous answer.<br/>
<br/>
Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?<br/>
There is no character advancement.<br/>
<br/>
How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?<br/>
The lack of character advancement and conflict/task resolution mechanics reinforce that the players already know what they want their characters to achieve... and they are going to get it.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?<br/>
Arousal, always. Decent erotic or romantic fiction, possibly.<br/>
<br/>
What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?<br/>
Generally the aim is to draw attention away from the game rules. However, there is a specific optional rule (see next question and answer) called (provisionally) the â€œThermometerâ€ - this is used to help pace the story and help the players mutually decide when to turn up the â€œheatâ€ of the encounter.<br/>
<br/>
Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in? Why?<br/>
The game includes optional rules which are included to help players get used to each other's narrative style. These rules are intended to be deliberately discarded by the players once they feel comfortable enough with each other not to need them. In other words, they are â€œtraining wheelsâ€ and the game is designed to get â€œthinnerâ€ (in he direction of freeform play) as players get more experienced with it. I think this is very close to what a lot of players do with the rules over time anyway, but it's explicit.<br/>
<br/>
Where does your game take the players that other games canâ€™t, donâ€™t, or wonâ€™t?<br/>
Into the bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
What are your publishing goals for your game?<br/>
Online distribution, very basic layout, Creative Commons do-what-the-hell-you-want-with-this licence.<br/>
<br/>
Who is your target audience?<br/>
People who already play â€œfreeformâ€ games. People who use more mechanics in their game, but are interested in moving towards â€œfreeformâ€ play. People who like to read or write erotic fiction.                        </div>

                            Interesting thread <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm very curious as to where it will end up.<br/>
<br/>
I came upon this article on the Skotos site.<br/>
<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/Mummers22.shtml" rel="nofollow">Sex and the Single Gamer</a><br/>

Perhaps it can give some additional input for this subject?                        </div>
