Not only will you <b>feature as a contributor</b> in the print release next Spring, but I've also got <b>a T-Shirt</b> and <b>a Hell for Leather PDF</b> to give away.<br/><br/>How does it work? I need an <b>Objective</b>, a <b>Drop-Off</b> and <b>three Checkpoints</b>.<br/><br/>The best suggestion will make up the "Your First Game" chapter, which will be used to demo Hell for Leather at conventions and to teach new readers the rules and potential of the game. Anyone who buys and plays Hell for Leather will be playing your scenario. The competition ends on the <b>22nd of December</b>.  Post your entries here, or on the <a href="http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/hell-for-leather-competition-the-first-game/" rel="nofollow">Cobweb Games</a> website.<br/><br/><b>Objective</b><br/>The game show, Hell for Leather, follows an advanced tactical military unit called the Hunters who track down and butcher contestants as they flee toward their Objective. In Hell for Leather, players play those contestants, and their job is to survive. The Objective is the location of the show-down between the surviving teams of contestants in the bloody finale at the end of the game. Ancient ruins, coliseums, and national landmarks make the best Objectives. Imagine a place you'd like to see a show-down in the movies.<br/><br/><b>Drop-Off</b><br/>This is where the contestants are dropped off. Teams can start anywhere, from the sahara desert, to down town Manhattan.<br/><br/><b>Checkpoints</b><br/>When play begins, each team is assumed to have been given instructions by the Network (the guys in charge of Hell for Leather) and to have agreed between their members on a strategy to complete these instructions. Checkpoints represent the components of that strategy. Think of three cool things that the contestants must do in turn in order to reach their Objective. Each Checkpoint is themed. The first should include <b>destruction</b>, the second <b>escape </b>and the last <b>access</b>. That is, first the contestants must stop something, destroy something, kill someone. Next they must flee, travel, cross a border, break out of capture. Lastly they must gain access to their Objective, parachuting in from above, bribing a security officer, etc.<br/><br/>For two examples of playtest Objective/Drop-Off/Checkpoints, see the AP reports of RPG Net <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=486755" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=485557" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246736/#Comment_246736" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T06:40:49+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  6:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 5:44AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Objective</b><br/>The ELA-3 launch complex at the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG), near Korou in French Guiana, satellite launch facility for Arianespace, the ESA, and others.

Glass showrooms backed by sweltering factories line the island's main canal, studded with public art (all large-format glass, of course). The only ways off Murano are public vaporetto or water taxi. Or stealing a speedboat.<br/><br/><b>Checkpoint One</b><br/>Demolish the concrete cap protecting Lake Karachay, dumping ground for the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing plant near Chelyabinsk in the southern Urals. Lake Karachay emits 600 r\xf6ntgens per hour (enough to kill a man in one hour).  <br/><br/><b>Checkpoint Two</b><br/>Cross the Makoko slums, built on stilts above Lagos Lagoon in Lagos, Nigeria. This will involve traveling by foot and canoe through crowds of suspicious, insular residents, avoiding the murderous local gangsters known as Area Boys, and dealing with brutal Nigerian police at the slum\u2019s edge.<br/><br/><b>Checkpoint Three</b><br/>Trek overland for fifty kilometers through swamp, jungle, and canebrake from the Cayenne river to the target.

Really nice entry, but too late!<br/><br/>I\u2019ve left the details very spartan but hopefully there are enough hooks here to build as complex (international backstabbing and double crossing) or as simple (random road trip of violence across Asia) a game as one would want. I followed Jay\u2019s format of putting my own ideas of how this might feel in brackets below but of course I would hope there are loads more ways this could play out.<br/><br/><b>Drop off</b>: Helmand Province, Afghanistan. A Taliban stronghold and the scene of some of the most intense and bloody fighting between NATO, largely British, and Taliban forces. You have been dropped in the middle of a small town not far from a British army base.<br/><br/>(Fuck. We\u2019re in the middle of a fucking warzone. All the locals hate us and the army will arrest us. And they\u2019d both torture us. We need to get out of here. Fast.)<br/><br/><b>Objective</b>: The Admiral Kuznetsov, Flagship of the Russian navy, headquarters of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, Vladivostok, Russia<br/><br/>(That\u2019s right, a 65,000 ton aircraft carrier, the only one of its kind, comrade.)<br/><br/><b>Checkpoint 1</b>: Burn the lucrative Taliban controlled opium fields<br/><br/>(How? Well we steal a Harrier Jump Jet and napalm the lot, right? Easy, when you know how. What\u2019s that? The Taliban have anti-aircraft guns? The RAF doesn\u2019t like it when you steal from them? We just caused the collapse of \u2018order\u2019 in Afghanistan as NATO has been blamed for launching this indiscriminate attack on the local opium farmers? Maybe we should have infiltrated the Taliban after all. Time to go methinks\u2026)<br/><br/><b>Checkpoint 2</b>: Cross China to Vladivostok<br/><br/>(Simple, we\u2019ve still got the Harrier, let\u2019s just fly there. Oh. Chinese airspace. Treated as a declaration of war from the British by the Chinese. I see. Shit. Shot down in to the Yangtze Dam eh? That\u2019s going to be a long walk. Why didn\u2019t we just follow Osama into Pakistan and then through India and Nepal and then into China. Right, the strictly controlled borders and armed guards. The hell with this, I\u2019m getting the train\u2026)<br/><br/><b>Checkpoint 3</b>: Gain entry to the Soviet Pacific Fleet HQ and board the Admiral Kuznetsov<br/><br/>(If we just knock and ask nicely? Oh, none of us speak Russian. Hmm, well actions do speak louder than words\u2026 What? The Russians were framing the British so they could make a play for power in Afghanistan again and we were the unwitting pawns in this game of espionage induced violence?! That\u2019s it, let\u2019s take this boat and storm the network!)<br/><br/>I hope all that makes some kind of sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
