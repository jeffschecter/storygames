I defiantly have room for, and enjoy very much, all types of RPGs/Story Games, but I was wondering what Story Games would you suggest that offer this type of character immersion and the potential for a long campaign?--I'm familiar with PbtA games and Fate games that are quite successful at this, but I'm hoping to learn about others.

How hard do you think it would be to adapt Dread into a Dark Fantasy game (or Dark Sci-Fi game) with toned-down horror elements? Not sure if this is a good idea as I've heard it really shines at producing the horror ambiance.

The whole point is that eventually the tower falls over and somebody dies. That's pretty dark.  But if you change it to be "eventually the tower falls over and... something kinda bad happens" then frankly you might as well just be rolling dice because you've sucked most of the tension out of it.<br/><br/>I too generally don't pursue immersion -- I generally roll my eyes a little bit, quietly, every time someone says something along the lines of "I'm only interested in playing games that let me immerse over the course of a 200 session campaign!"  I also have a hard time recommending games as "immersion friendly" because I find the logic of what disrupts a given person's immersion to generally be very personal and unlikely to match the logic of what disrupts a different person's immersion.<br/><br/>For example, which of these things do you find immersion breaking:<br/>Having to make up some details of a thing your character knows about<br/>Having to make up some details of a thing in the world that your character doesn't know about<br/>Having to keep in mind character "personality traits" ala Burning Wheel's Beliefs<br/>Having to reward other players for good roleplaying by passing them a token<br/>Having to reward other players for playing their "personality traits" by passing them a token<br/>Having to roll dice for social interactions<br/>Having to frame a scene<br/>Having to switch to control of another character in a scene in which your "main" character does not appear<br/>Paying a "Fate point" to add a "detail" to a scene<br/>Accepting a "Fate point" for a "compel" that requires your character to act in a certain way<br/>Spending any kind of "out of game" currency for an ingame effect<br/><br/><br/>I also have a hard time reconciling my personal definition of "story games" with a request for immersive play, because in general, to me, "story games" imply that the players occasionally step into Author Stance and create something, or...well... tell some story.  So games like Apocalypse World to be skirt the very very edge of "story game" and are mostly really just traditional RPGs with some different design choices.  I get annoyed everytime someone calls Fate a "story game" <br/><br/>I hope this doesn't sound too much like I am bashing immersion, and it's DEFINITELY not my intent to bash "traditional" RPGs - most of my gaming and many of my favorite games are fairly traditional.  It's just that pretty much every single one of them falls prey to SOME of the "potentially immersion breaking" points, above.<br/><br/>I guess I could recommend The One Ring, but that's....really not a storygame by any definition I can think of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456663/#Comment_456663" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T20:39:54+00:00" title="September 27, 2016  8:39PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2016 8:52PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a><br/>Cool, thanks for you thoughts regarding Dread <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I see your point <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Personally, I don't have much of a dog in this fight; I really enjoy all types of RPGs and Story Games like you do <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> For me, they all offer something different and compelling; that said, I do tend to prefer games with a narrative approach and that involve social mechanics, not just mindless combat. I love collaborative and GMless games in which the players work together to tell a story or create a history or build a world, etc.; but, admittedly, I also find enjoyment in getting deeply involved in a character (and of course, sometimes you can manage to do both). <br/><br/>You make a very good point when you say the things that break immersion tend to be variable and subjective. I think for me being very much involved in the creation of the story (in a traditional GM sense) while I'm playing the game, rather then on the receiving end of it tends to do this; which is to say, if I'm telling a large part of the story it tends to get in the way of immersion (which as I said offers other benifites [e.g. often times a better and more creative story] and is enjoyable in its own way). I really enjoy different aspects of RPGs and Story Games and see them as a continuum and not at odds with each other. I enjoy when creative aspects of both approaches are blended together. But I can also see how the question could be annoying, being that it is probably a complaint traditionalists make that some Story Gamers think is unfounded.

I too very much enjoy both types of games, but I feel like I must not be immersing the same way people who are really All About The Immersion(tm) are, and I honestly have trouble understanding how they can reach that level of immersion while sitting around a table rolling dice - which is pretty much all it takes to remind ME that I am a person sitting around a table rolling dice. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>All that nonsense about my personal hangups out of the way, I would recommend:<br/><br/>Blades in the Dark - this game has some bits where I'm sure NO ONE immerses, because you are definitely making decisions for a game perspective, but I think it definitely has potential for immersion in the parts where you really ARE playing your character, down in the gloom of Duskwall.  This is probably no more "storygame" than your Dungeon World sort of stuff, but it's really GOOD.  And it supports potentially very long campaigns.<br/><br/>Polaris (<a href="http://www.tao-games.com/polaris/" rel="nofollow">The Ben Lehman one</a>, not the translated from the French Sci fi one) is, on the other hand, very MUCH a storygame.  But the way the roles are divided up allows for the "Heart" player for each character to do some pretty serious immersing while the other three players sortof co-GM for them.  The Heart does frame scenes though.  Also, while this one supports longer term play in the sense that it's probably going to take you several sessions to get through it, it's not really suitable for "campaign" play in my opinion.  Though you might be able to make that happen, it would involve transitioning through different characters.<br/><br/>Masks - I haven't played this yet, but it's the first superhero RPG to interest me, basically, ever.  It's all about being a teenaged superhero with some sort of issues.  The game is less about what your powers are and more about how you VIEW yourself.  Very interesting design, as suitable for long term play as any PbtA game.<br/><br/>World of Dew - I kinda un-recommended this on in the PvP thread, but even though I felt it was heavier than it needed to be, I think it has the potential to create a very interesting game.  And it all but demands long term play to engage with the character advancement/city development aspects of the game.   It's ALMOST like Fate with a bunch of other stuff added on.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel or Mouse Guard - I lump these together because they're very similar systems.  They're not super storygamey, but the focus on the characters and their Beliefs is what drives play, and they support long term character development and play very nicely.<br/><br/>Also, see the above recommendation for The One Ring, which basically does Tolkien amazingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456666/#Comment_456666" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T22:42:38+00:00" title="September 27, 2016 10:42PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2016 10:57PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If all you require on the immersion front is that you play your character instead of doing any GM tasks, I think you have tons of options.  If you want long-term play to be possible, again, I'd say tons of options.  <br/><br/>Character-play story games <i>focused</i> on long-term play are definitely more rare, though.  It seems to me that a lot of character-play story games shine between 1 and 12 sessions.  If I'm gonna play 50 sessions of something, I'll prefer a slow build, ongoing character progress, lots of zoomed-in detail, and plenty of unknowns to explore and discover.  I'm trying to think of small press games that do that without piggybacking on d20 or BRP or Gumshoe... um...  Conspiracy of Shadows?  The Clay that Woke?  I haven't played either one, but my vague impressions run in that direction.  <br/><br/>All the games from BW HQ fit your bill -- Burning Wheel, Mouse Guard, etc.  Burning Empires you pretty much <i>have to</i> play 20+ sessions if you want the full package.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Blades in the Dark looks ideal for long-term play, but isn't finished yet.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are some AW hacks that slow character advancement down to where you retire (or whatever) after 30ish sessions instead of 10ish, but I don't know which they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456669/#Comment_456669" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T22:54:58+00:00" title="September 27, 2016 10:54PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2016 10:56PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like I shoulda read Airk's last post and just said "Yeah, what he said."  <br/><br/>Except that Polaris is exactly what you said you were <i>not</i> looking for, Jeff, as you spend 3/4 of the game doing stuff other than playing your character.  <br/><br/>I would also say that In a Wicked Age, despite making it compelling to jump into character just as Dirk describes, is very very far from what you requested.

Mostly I do prefer more traditional games when I'm hunting immersion, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456675/#Comment_456675" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T23:42:14+00:00" title="September 27, 2016 11:42PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Arik">@Arik</a><br/>These are really great games <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I have Polaris, BW, MG, BitD; can't wait for the BitD book to come out <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I will check out WoD and Masks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456677/#Comment_456677" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T23:49:08+00:00" title="September 27, 2016 11:49PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a><br/>I need to take a look at CoS and TCtW, thanks for mentioning them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I also need to check out SiS, PL, and CD.

For me it breaks the suspension of disbelief if I do too much of the GM stuff. It's like being the writer and reader at the same time. So when I play a Story Game, that is very much about the story, I don't get  immersed in the character, I get immersed in the story. It's two different experiences for me; although, I like games that blend elements of both.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment"

A feeling of dissonance can happen if you have to look at it from different perspectives (different roles or as a player/game master). I dunno, I'm speculating freely here.

There is a specific thing I like to do with some games, though, where I achieve a sense of being there inside the fiction, looking out through my character's eyes, and <i>that</i> does <i>not</i> come and go at the drop of a hat (for me).  It's kind of like dreaming -- with a minor disruption, maybe you can just fall right back into the dream, but if you spend too much time or focus on something else, then it takes a while to resume.<br/><br/>I'll second <i>Montsegur 1244</i>.  It's very light on disruptive factors, and gives you fantastic traction to dig into your character and face the situation they're facing.  That's some people's absolute favorite version of immersion!

Perhaps immersion isn't the right word...maybe it's more a sense of continuity in my state of disbelief. Have you ever watched a movie and been so engrossed in it that the rest of your life and the world felt like it went away for that two hours--that's the feeling I'm getting at. I think I just tend to get more absorbed, because my state of disbelief stays intact, when I can listen to the plot of the story unfold instead of taking part in the telling of the plot. It might be similar to the difference between how an audience feels when they watch a movie (their suspension of disbelief intact) and how the director feels when they watch their movie (they see the process). So for me, the traditional GM/PC paradigm gives me more of that suspension of disbelief, whereas playing a story game that mixes those things up (ie everyone creates an aspect of the plot), is more of a creative exercise for me than an "immersive" one, if that makes sense. I enjoy and get something out of both but for me they're different in regard to how much my of suspension of disbelief stays intact.

Fortunately, it's still possible to have some kind of conversations about it by focusing on your subjective experience. I might mean something totally different from you when I saw "immersion", but it's still meaningful for you to say that *this experience* feels immersive, but *that one* does not - to you.<br/><br/>If I were to speculate a little, I have my own mental model of immersion. I think that <i>immersion</i> as a state of willing suspension of disbelief. When you read that fantasy novel as a young child, and it seemed <i>completely real</i> to you, you made the choice to create it that way in your mind - to believe the words on the page and imbue them with the power of your imagination. <br/><br/><b>I believe that immersion for most people requires two things: <i>familiarity</i> and <i>trust</i>.</b><br/><br/>First, you have to find the process of play familiar enough that it can fade to the back of your mind. This could include the setting for some people ("I feel immersed when I'm playing in my friend's basement, but not at the Cafe."), noise level, presentation, the game system being used, and so forth. <br/><br/>It's not about complexity; some people have very "immersive" games in really rules-heavy systems once they are familiar with them. <i>D&amp;D</i> has a lot of counter-immersive elements (e.g. only being able to use an ability once per day, hit points, classes, etc.), but people who are used to the game and have played for years can internalize all those things and find <i>D&amp;D</i> highly immersive (while a game with an unfamiliar mechanic, like Keys or Plot Points or Dice Pools or some other thing will totally throw them).<br/><br/>You see this in other media, too. People who have spent their whole lives watching movies and getting engrossed in them find it hard to fully relate to the characters in a film which is shot in 3-D, digitally, or in some unfamiliar style of storytelling. The novelty is distracting.<br/><br/>The trust issue is similar: for you to enter a state of willing suspension of disbelief, you have to trust that the process will deliver. You must, similarly, trust the people you are playing with, and their ability to engage with you. When that is in place, you can let down your guard - so to speak - and allow your mind to pretend that what you are experiencing is real.<br/><br/>So, trust is that other factor. Do you trust the people involved? Do you trust the process? Do you trust the flow of play to create something you find engaging? Do you trust the mechanics to deliver consistently? Then you can be ready to engage.<br/><br/>Sometimes you can jump in head-first, and simply *choose* to place your trust in something unfamiliar. Generally, though, that's difficult for people.<br/><br/>For instance, a trusted and beloved GM could run some weird game with mechanics I don't like, and I can get over it and dig deep into the game. On the other hand, playing a favourite game with all the design features I like might now work for me if I don't know what the people I'm playing with are doing with it, or which way they're going to turn.<br/><br/>All this makes it hard to answer a general query like "which story games help with immersion?" Everyone will have different needs, depending on who they're playing with and what they are familiar with.<br/><br/>What assumptions do you, in particular, bring to this particular table? We all have a bunch of these (and they could be different, even changing day-to-day!).<br/><br/>I find a lot of "story gamey" mechanics, in particular, conducive to my immersion, even when, in theory, they force me to make decisions outside of my character's head - because, much like the D&amp;D veteran can rationalize away using his abilities 1/day or refusing to pick up a sword to defend himself because he's a Wizard, I can reinterpret them effortlessly as choices my character is making. I find negotiating unclear distribution of narrative authority (e.g. Fiasco) very difficult for immersion, on the other hand. <br/><br/>I accept that these are personal quirks of mine, and may change over time, as well as depending on who I'm playing with.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456897/#Comment_456897" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-05T19:58:26+00:00" title="October  5, 2016  7:58PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm DMing a 5e campaign and using a few story game tricks I learned from here and other games. Namely, I always ask players for input <i>from their character's point of view</i>,  either mountain-witch way or brainstorming stuff. We brainstormed the setting using some specific questions and I asked questions for each player to respond as a representative of their race or class.<br/><br/>Then there's all the info they pour down on their character sheets: every high or low stat, their choice of weapons and defenses, equipment, etc. There's a lot of story there if you try to read it and imagine where does everything comes from. As a DM, I didn't even had to ask the players for this, I just took note of all I can to use it as flags.<br/><br/>Next there's the actual character background they have come up with. Flags are more obvious here.<br/><br/>After taking note of all this, I started tracing the campaign idea connecting the flags and adding whatever felt logic or cool to have. It's only here that I bring my own tastes as a GM into the equation.<br/><br/>And later in-game, we started using taverns as quest generators. I just asked the players what rumours did they heard over the conversations of the customers and gave them a couple of random words if they got stuck, so they could spin out their own quest ideas. It's fine if they want specific things too, like looking for magic weapons, you just turn that into a quest and you're set.<br/><br/>Next thing I'd like to try is to prompt players to connect some dots in character now that several things have happened. Like, why there were sharks on a lake and a bunch of insane elfs on the island of that lake? Where do the groups of low level demons come from and why were they trying to open a portal near this lake? I'd like to have them make a few statements and maybe roll INT to come up with a way to find proof of those statements, maybe just get their ideas to happen (cause often they come up with better, more interesting evil ideas than I do) <br/><br/>Actually, we all have probably done this last thing more than once; hear the players jokes or worst fears after we have framed some strange detail on a scene and found their idea so awesome we just have to make it happen. Most of the time they will notice you just changed plans right there and sarcastically thank the player who gave the idea, but that is okey, it has never stopped the game nor ruined the fun when it happened. You can even bullshit your way out of it putting a poker face and asking the player if she's been reading your notes while you were away. It will probably still not convince anyone you were stealing ideas from the players anyway, but nobody said you couldn't do it.<br/><br/>So, my point is that you can actually take any trad RPG you feel comfortable with and use a couple of tricks like these. It won't turn it into a story game, but it will allow heavy use of player input without breaking your suspension of disbelief too much nor too often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456898/#Comment_456898" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-05T20:14:33+00:00" title="October  5, 2016  8:14PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's impossible for me to reach the same level of not-paying-attention-to-everything-else that I reach with a book while playing an RPG.
