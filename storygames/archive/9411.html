In particular, it is designed for playing story-games in which the story is about the main characters' attempts to change the world because of the things they care about, what they are prepared to risk or sacrifice to achieve that, and how the experience changes them."<br/><br/>I've just got my latest draft of the Pentasystem (version 0.8) into a mostly self-consistent state. I think it's baked enough now that I'm ready to show it to others, though it's definitely still work in progress. There may not be much more of this progress for a little while, though, as I'm about to have less time to work on it.<br/><br/>I've uploaded it to Google Docs, chapter by chapter. Some of these contain ideas and techniques that you could easily port into other games (especially the Coolmap and Paths). When it's finished it will be CC-Attribution, so feel free to raid it, with the disclaimer that this is not the final version.<br/><br/>The system is based on rolling between 1 and 5d6 (depending on the character attribute in use), with success numbers determined by the character's rating in the arena in which the conflict takes place (physical, mental etc.). Particular numbers also cause either short-term good consequences and long-term bad consequences or vice versa, and the longer you keep the conflict going, the greater the short-term risk (and long-term reward). I think it's rather clever.<br/><br/>I killed the GM and took his stuff and distributed it among the players. Everyone plays multiple characters, runs sets, frames scenes and owns particular aspects of the game world. <br/><br/>An initial group brainstorm determines what people want to see in the game, and an ingenious budgeting method means that they will get to see that.<br/><br/>Both the group and individual characters have things to strive after and achieve. Player engagement is a major design goal.<br/><br/>Chapter summary in the next post.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208623/#Comment_208623" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T15:20:47+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  3:20PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's what's in each chapter.
