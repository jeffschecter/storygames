The players play the ladies that are most intimate with the unpredictable Queen, who share each other's admiration for her. Some look up to her personality, some try to mirror her, some are in love with her. <br/><br/>As fiction, it is about an expunged female world. As a game, it is about exploring devotion, identification and an intangible personality that defies classification and reduction. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145553/Alienr?src=storygames" rel="nofollow">Purchase (pwyw) or download Alien\xf2r on Drivethrurpg.com</a><br/><br/><a href="http://maracanda.deviantart.com/art/Alienor-free-pdf-518882807" rel="nofollow">View or download Alien\xf2r for free on deviantArt</a><br/><br/>Both design, layout and art were created independently by me.

The game is pitched as a game about 'devotion', but what does this exactly mean? To me, <i>Alien\xf2r</i> is like a book, a very layered game, with interesting game mechanics serving plenty different themes and subjects. Hopefully I'll shed a little light on this core theme of <i>Alien\xf2r</i>.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145553/Alienr?src=storygames" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://pre08.deviantart.net/551e/th/pre/i/2015/089/e/b/postersmall_by_maracanda-d8npovv.png" width="750px"/></a><br/><br/>Yesterday I had a conversation with a friend, who is a philosopher. We both don't believe that human beings exist of two equivalent parts (soul and body), but rather that there's only one part of the two that does all the thinking and feeling and experiencing. The other part is the outside. It requires a leap of faith to imagine that the other faces and bodies around us also harbour a similar spirit like ours (unlike Jedi, who can sense other souls right away). Most human relations though, unfortunately reduce other people merely to one aspect, a connection between mere contingent humans ('persons'). Some relations require people to consider both components (love, friendship, education...). In philosophy, relations without any physical contingent aspect can only be religious or philosophical in nature, and not between real people.<br/><br/><i>Alien\xf2r</i>, to me, is about a relation that is purely noumenal, while still being contingent. In the game, the main character is not any of the ladies-in-waiting, but Queen Alien\xf2r. However, there's little more of her in the game than just her name. Historically speaking, we're sure of very little about her, and unsure about anything else. But this was not the only reason. Surely the game could have included a brief biography, some undisputed facts about her? Players and readers will also notice that there is no playbook, principles or moves for Alien\xf2r, something that could be expected from a game about one central character that is played by all the players together. In fact, <i>Alien\xf2r</i> <b>lacks all particular characterization</b> of its title character.<br/><br/>It is up to the players to create her from scratch, although the game offers a lot of help to create the player character. There's two very controversial tables in the character creation that are very interesting: they require the player to choose a trivial distinguishing physical feature (for eachother) and a virtue (for themselves). The accompanying text explicitly ascribes the chosen features to the Queen herself, thereby characterizing her by proxy. But it is the interpretation of the Queen by the ladies themselves, and that keeps it from being characterizations of Alien\xf2r herself. <br/><br/>By defining their own character, players speculate at the personality of the central character. They don't create facts about her, although they do kindle their creativity and inform eachother. Just like the historical figure, Alien\xf2r will continue to challenge reductions to a single personality. She's written like that. Even if players agree on her and create an ad-hoc screenplay for her, she'll still remain thoroughly independent. <br/><br/>Imagine an 'Alien\xf2r generator', with mechanics to create your own queen. This game is the contrary of that. It circles around her on purpose, and compels players to do the same. When you get it, you know that there's tranquillity in the Duquessa's unpredictability. <br/><br/>The ladies are very close to the Queen, and all look up to her. It is impossible to play this game with the Queen as antagonist. Players that don't get this will soon enough notice that <b>Czege's principle</b> will kick in as soon as they need to play both the Queen and their own player character. <br/><br/>This devotion, my philosophy friend remarked, is akin to the Mary-devotion that started around the 12th century (Alien\xf2rs century). Like a religious experience it attaches the admiration to a character that is never truly grasped entirely, but it's about a concrete woman nonetheless, or it is supposed to.<br/><br/>There's Alien\xf2r, her beautiful name, and nothing else apart from the ladies. Her name means 'the other A\xe9nor', and like 'other Alien\xf2rs', the ladies-in-waiting are her satellites and reflections. But there's nothing else apart from her name in the game that captures her. (Except for the drawings, but that's another subject.) My work is done when you see a name for a real, contingent character that can at once be universally related to. When you see potentiality, I've already been successful. It's then up to you to create a real character and a story out of that! <br/><br/>Let me know your thoughts. <br/><br/><hr/><br/><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145553/Alienr?src=storygames" rel="nofollow">www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145553/Alienr</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/maracanda" title="maracanda"><img alt="maracanda" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/236/nYDJK66XVHRHJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/maracanda">maracanda</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444477/#Comment_444477" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-30T16:08:10+00:00" title="March 30, 2015  4:08PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2015 4:16PM by maracanda.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145553/Alienr?src=storygames" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://orig10.deviantart.net/419b/f/2015/089/7/d/alienorprint_by_maracanda-d8npisj.jpg" width="750px"/></a><br/><br/>One of the 30 limited edition prints, lovingly handcrafted with care.
