I don't need a map of people or places that the players repeatedly interact with.  I'd like ideas around creating episodic cases to solve, including the temporary people and places surrounding them.  The locations could be anywhere in the US.<br/><br/>It's not that I mind PCs entering play with some previous relationships, to have some interesting, personal content for me to include in the situations I put them in.  And sure, over time new relationships will gel and become old relationships and we can use that too.<br/><br/>But right now I'm looking for any advice, links, or games around prepping the episodic stuff!  This isn't urgent.  I have some ideas on how I plan to approach this to start with, but it would be nice to find some ideas to help me speed up the prep of future cases.

I know this premise is pretty far removed from Shadow Agencies, but the basic idea of episodic missions is well structured and could be a good resource for thinking about your game. <br/><br/>Stuff I recall about Mouse Guard:<br/><br/>-<b>Play split into GM's Turn and Player's Turn. </b>The GM's Turn focuses on the mission at hand and what challenges the players-as-a-team need to overcome to either complete it or get to a twist. The Player's Turn (either post-mission, or at a pause in the action) lets the players direct their characters' personal interests and goals. It's a strict structure but it keeps the players and play focused.<br/><br/>-<b>The party are a unit.</b> It's a given in <i>Mouse Guard</i> that the players are Guardmice and are all sworn into service. There's no D&amp;D-type situations where we have to justify radically different Adventurers hanging out together: while the players will disagree on how a mission should be undertaken, they can't blow it off for one they like better. <br/><br/>-<b>Episodic play built into larger structure.</b> The rules are quite explicit that Missions should really be 1 session, 2 at most. These missions are then built into a campaign structure of 6-8 sessions which will take the players through an entire year. Seasons are important in <i>Mouse Guard</i>, changing the world and challenge level, and characters effectively 'level-up' come Winter. While the seasons might not be so important for Shadow Agents, perhaps yearly budget adjustments based on effectiveness and performance reviews might help pull together an episodic structure. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462529/#Comment_462529" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T14:18:54+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  2:18PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have in mind all the types of paranormal abilities and common skills player have, these are flags, meaning these are things they want to see and use in the game. Each case must offer a clue when using at least three of these on a particular place/person/moment.<br/><br/>Then you have to follow the usual advice when dealing with crime fiction plots: Chose one or more types of crime, then start your prep with the truth about the felony: clear motives (often make these as emotional, deep and/or otherwise as conflictive as you can) and a simple execution of the crime.<br/><br/>Next, start going backwards, list 3 things that took things up to that point. Then go forward and list 3 things the perpetrator could have done to hide his trail. You can roll dice for each of these clues and obstacles, to find out how easy is to make these connections, or how clever was the criminal at hiding these and get a DC for finding out each one, mostly to determine how hard is for the players to find out when they don't look at the right place or make the right questions.<br/><br/>You could add another minor crime and suspects into this mix to act as red herrings, or just make three of these at random. I wouldn't recommend to go further complicating things because players imagination will make up for all the complications, misunderstandings and extra red herrings you could want.<br/><br/>Take in consideration that at least one of these things is going to be obviously supernatural, otherwise it would've not called for paranormal expert attention on the first case.<br/><br/>Also, never make things impossible to discover. At worst they should take precious time, maybe just enough to turn cold the trail of the culprit.<br/><br/>My other recommendation would be to use any related fiasco's setup for helping you with the prep, the recipe is more clear there: somebody wants something so badly that may jump at any chance to get it, and make a mess out of this because they are usually on the company of people with similar thoughts, opposite principles, lack of control and strong emotions attached to some other person or part of this situation.<br/><br/>Hope this helps a bit, best luck!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462532/#Comment_462532" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T14:48:16+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  2:48PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been doing some episodic stuff on the side lately. I am a lazy prepper and good at improvisation, so what I've found useful is lifting plots and characters from pre-existing novels and movies. Gives me a quick chassis, and I can pretty much finagle the rest without having to spend several hours prepping.<br/><br/>As a particular hint, if your game is like a police show (that is, the PCs are a party of investigators coming into situations from the outside), then most existing stories will work just fine as episode material, but crime stories will obviously work the best. In all cases, though, you're not looking to cast the PCs as the protagonists of the original story: you're looking to identify the crime and the angle of approach for the police, and that's where the PCs come in. Half of the events of the original story have probably already happened, and the rest will happen while the cops race to uncover and prevent whatever it is.<br/><br/>As an intentionally humorous example, consider the Lord of the Rings as fodder for an episode of an "outsider investigator" game. Let's say that you've read the book and decide to simply start from the beginning. You identify the following points in the story:<br/><br/><b>Hook:</b> The Ring has been stolen, the PCs need to get it back. This is a good investigative hook because it gives the PCs a clear motivation to hassle the characters of the story.<br/><b>Approach:</b> The PCs know that the "Baggins" is a hobbit from the Shire, but the've never been there.<br/><br/>Oh well, that came out as "you're playing the nazguls", but you'll believe me when I tell you that this was an accident - the nazguls just happen to have an investigator-like role in the first few acts of the story. The point is, once you've identified why the PCs are interested and where exactly they come in, the rest is easy: you just convert all the ready-made scenario material into the terms of your own game. Like so:<br/><br/>Hobbits -&gt; some local community/ethnicity of people in your setting<br/>The Shire -&gt; a slightly exotic, perhaps creepy place insofar as the PCs are concerned<br/>The Ring -&gt; the McGuffin, whatever suits the milieu<br/>Frodo Baggins -&gt; some other name, a young-ish guy who's stumbled upon the McGuffin<br/>Gandalf -&gt; the ringleader behind the Ring heist<br/>Rivendel -&gt; a safe base for the culprits, e.g. the local Chinatown<br/><br/>... and so on. Now you have a whole bunch of NPCs and places and situations to work with. Next you do what you gotta do prep-wise to fill in the cracks (for me this is almost nothing - it would be useful to give the cast new names, but otherwise I might as well start play at this point) , and then you're ready to play!<br/><br/>The core value of this "steal from a novel/movie" trick is that it gives you ready-made characters that have already been impressed into your memory when you first experienced the original story. It appears that this alone gives me personally something like 40% of everything I need as a GM, prep-wise. The pre-existing plot with its motivations and situations is also valuable. (It should go without saying that all this has nothing to do with railroading - the original story is there strictly as fodder, you don't have any investment in executing it in play.)<br/><br/><b>Nota bene:</b> What I describe above is fully applicable not only to novels and movies, but also to prior rpg adventures. Just last Tuesday I had some cyberpunk police detectives investigating a series of crimes, part of which were simply what their own PCs did in a prior western blood opera, and the rest being the scenario from a <i>Dead of Night</i> game earlier. (We had a house con just now, that's why so many sessions in such a short time.) Worked like a charm.<br/><br/>(In case you're wondering why I've been doing this kind of stuff, it's because of this amazing Bladerunner noir cyberpunk police drama game that I've been playtesting. It requires the GM to develop like half a dozen crimes for each session, which takes ages if you don't have procedures for it. The above is part of what I've been doing to make this work.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462535/#Comment_462535" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T16:24:32+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  4:24PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2017 4:25PM by ffilz.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice ideas Euro.

(Probably won't work with something you're not familiar with - too little detail, and it's the visceral details of how characters act and so on that help kickstart your own creativity here.) You can get the names of all the characters in the movie, and as a bonus you also get the names of the actors on the same page, which means that if you're doing something modern world-ish, you can usually mix and match some acceptable names for the NPCs while doing research. Or just use the original names <br/><br/>In last Sunday's session of the aforementioned cyberpunk detective game we had a spree killer named "Ryan Gosling", simply because his character in <i>Drive</i> (a crime movie, that) doesn't have a name, so I got to use the actor's. It was amusing how the main character of the movie turned on a dime to become a high-profile killer when the play focused in the police perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
