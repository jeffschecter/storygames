I've been away from this board for something like three years (time goes so fast), but I'm back now and I need your help.<br/>First of all, I'd like to put things into context (you'll see, I think it is important) and I have a couple of questions.<br/>You might (or mostly not) remember me with my project, Avalanche, a multi-plots calendar based campaign. <br/>So, what had happened ?<br/><br/><b>Fall 2010 : finishing it by myself</b><br/>For your information, Avalanche is not only a campaign, it is also a tool : a web based engine made to manage plots (content as adventures, not system like rolling dice or character creation). In fall 2010, the campaign was almost finished, but I couldn't find any programmer to help with the website. In my early days, I had been a developer (I was then a project manager), so I decided to take the job myself. That was a lot, but a lot of job. It took me around three months to develop the "engine". I was then working on the "main website" : the website that would present the product, that is there to <i>sell</i>. I was almost done and Avalanche would finally see the light of day and get "out there".<br/>And then, by that time, I quit my job as a project manager.<br/><br/><b>Winter 2011 : the harsh truth</b><br/>I didn't know exactly for what kind of job I was looking for, and, by chance, someone offered me to get into a partnership and have my own business, a "web agency". I was really happy about this, but I also thought that would be great for Avalanche. And then, I discovered the harsh truth, having access to professional skills of marketing and ergonomics :<br/>- the "user interface" of my engine was crap.<br/>- the design was non functional.<br/>- the "main website" was just plain terrible.<br/><br/>Avalanche could be good as a game, a product, a campaign ... but it didn't really matter : no one would be able to use my interface without massive help, and I just didn't have the skills to <i>sell it</i>.<br/>But still, the good news : I now had access to professionals !!!<br/><br/><b>Winter 2011 - Spring 2013 : developing the web agency</b><br/>Starting and building a company is not an easy thing. We kept Avalanche in mind, but that wasn't our priority : we were developing the web agency. Starting as two free lancers, we are now, two years later, almost five employees and we have our own office, in Montreal. What services do we offer ? Here's an idea :<br/>- web marketing (adwords, SEO, PPC) and strategy (which channel to use, for instance Youtube/newsletter/Facebook)<br/>- production of content<br/>- optimization of websites (UX tests, A/B testing)<br/>- conception of websites (business architecture and analysis, human-machine interface, design)<br/>- we also work in mobile environment<br/>- game design and game layer (yes, we develop mobile games for instance)<br/><br/>I guess that's the kind of stuff I need for Avalanche. And that's what we're going to do.<br/><i>Important note </i>: a web agency works in what we call a B2B environment (business to business). We don't have customers ourselves ; we work with companies who have customers themselves. We see Avalanche as our first B2C (business to customers) product.<br/><br/><b>Summer 2013 - let's "kickstart" it</b><br/>Avalanche, cycles-rpg, whatever ... it is now branded under "ExiStanc3". Also, we have a logo now. And, we've moved from "trying to sell it" to "trying to raise money" to produce it. That said, it is not really about the money. KickStarter offers in fact, a lot more than that (I guess that is the purpose of another discussion).<br/>I've been working a lot lately around KickStarter and we've come with some strategies.<br/><br/><i>Important note :</i> this site, and its members (you), are not my direct customers. I guess I would define this site as a "media" (you need medias in your kickstarter strategy) for the rpg aspect of my campaign. Sites where my customers might be (say ENWorld) will be address later. And just a final note : I truly believe, in the context of a kickstarter campaign that we have to appeal beyond the sole "role players".<br/><br/><b>Questions</b><br/>In three years, lots had also happen in the indie publisher community ; the forge has ended, for instance, KickStarter is there.<br/>I intend to publish an article on this site about our early steps in our kickstarter campaign : we developed a landing page and decided to drive traffic and manage our community on Facebook. So, I'm going to explain you <i>why</i> we did it and <i>how</i>. I hope this will interest you.<br/>Otherwise :<br/>- is this site still a good place to talk about those matters ?<br/>- where is the community so far about kickstarter ? I've seen Luke Crane doing it and also some other projects, but I'm more talking about "collective intelligence".<br/>- what kind of exposure/interest do kickstarter campaign about rpg projects do get in the community ?<br/>- are there other communities (i.e. sites) I should be addressing that would be defined as media ?<br/>- are there some resources out there that would give a list of non-media site I should be targeting ?<br/>- what was the overall impact of the closure of the forge ?<br/><br/><i>Important note : </i> my concerns are not about <i>publishing</i> but about <i>marketing</i>.<br/><br/><b>Direct promotion</b><br/>Here's my landing page : <a href="http://www.existanc3.com/" rel="nofollow">www.existanc3.com</a><br/>Here's my Facebook page : <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Existanc3" rel="nofollow">Existanc3 on Facebook</a><br/><br/>We're starting this very slow.

But it is now the good time to see it and address it before trying to reach more people.<br/>We think we need to show more what we're doing : people won't just follow and engage us because we look "cool". This forces us to produce stuff right away (and, by the way, this is a big change for me : I can produce and adjust rapidly).<br/><br/>So, what we think we need :<br/>- A FAQ<br/>- A video teaser, a kind of trailer for ExiStanc3 (we're going to use it for kickStarter anyway, so we want feedback)<br/>- character sheet<br/>- our player's aid<br/>- example of the final product for Avalanche<br/>- a new version of my old teaser (a 20 pages pdf)<br/>- our maps<br/>- lots of images<br/><br/>Those were things we were going to release slowly. Obliviously, we need a change of plan. <br/><b>Would you agree with my assumptions ? See anything else I should put there ?</b><br/><br/>Otherwise, remember : set goals, expose slowly to try, measure and adjust. Measure, measure and measure. It is alright be to wrong, but you need to know it.<br/>Note : by measuring I mean using tools like <i>google analytic</i> and the <i>insight</i> function of Facebook.<br/><br/><b>On another subject</b><br/>I've found, strangely, many discussion groups about rpg on linkedIn. I've subscribed to some, but essentially, I'm watching at the moment.<br/><b>Have some of you tried those groups ?<br/>Who participate in those groups (are they professional or players ... there seems to be both) ?<br/>Do you have any groups you would recommend ?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419007/#Comment_419007" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T10:26:59+00:00" title="July 25, 2013 10:26AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see you've hit the wall of dead silence. Sorry about that. Let me try to address some of your questions.<br/><br/><b>- is this site still a good place to talk about those matters ?</b><br/><br/>Sure, I guess, though this is a community about <i>play</i> and not about <i>design</i>. There's the Praxis forum (see the link at the top of the site) but it's hardly used. Still, if people are interested in your project, they'll give feedback here.<br/><br/><b>- where is the community so far about kickstarter ? I've seen Luke Crane doing it and also some other projects, but I'm more talking about "collective intelligence".</b><br/><br/>Kickstarter is a viable way to fund a project, but I think you need to instill confidence to get the money. I've backed a number of Kickstarter RPG projects myself (and at pretty high levels) and I've seen projects hit the tens of thousands -- even hundreds of thousands -- of dollars, so I know it <i>can</i> work.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what you're asking, regarding "collective intelligence," though. Explain?<br/><br/><b>- what kind of exposure/interest do kickstarter campaign about rpg projects do get in the community ?</b><br/><br/>I dunno. Enough to make lots of money? People "share" stuff that is interesting.<br/><br/><b>- are there other communities (i.e. sites) I should be addressing that would be defined as media ?</b><br/><br/>I don't know what you're looking for here.<br/><br/><b>- are there some resources out there that would give a list of non-media site I should be targeting ?</b><br/><br/>I don't know of any. Maybe look up Fred Hicks and send him a message. (Chase him down on G+ or twitter.) He is knowledgeable about such things.<br/><br/><b>- what was the overall impact of the closure of the forge ?</b><br/><br/>Ron and Vincent now have more free time to do other things. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>Also, people now post about design less, and they tend to do it on blogs and G+. <br/><br/><br/><b>Those were things we were going to release slowly. Obliviously, we need a change of plan. <br/>Would you agree with my assumptions ? See anything else I should put there ?</b><br/><br/>I think you're smart to really map out how to approach a Kickstarter. A bunch of people have written helpful guides to successfully Kickstarting a project. Find them and grok them. Realize that <i>too much success</i> can bankrupt you, if you haven't planned for it. Consider shipping costs up front (and international rates are much higher now). Map out your stretch goals in advance so you can react to the pace of your Kickstarter. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419010/#Comment_419010" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T10:41:00+00:00" title="July 25, 2013 10:41AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to say mean/helpful things but Adam said nice/helpful things so this is just to say thanks to him for being helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419047/#Comment_419047" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T20:37:26+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  8:37PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've supported a few RPG crowdfunding projects, although I've never run one, so I don't know how helpful these remarks will be.<br/><br/>Just from being a long-time lurker and sometimes-poster to these forums, it seems to me that there are some folks around here who are extremely savvy when it comes to crowdfunding.<br/><br/>There have been some extremely successful campaigns, and some terrific flops. In general, the trend seems to be:<br/>+ The more you tell people about your game, before and during the campaign, the more likely they are to contribute. (For example, I think your assumptions regarding what product info the customer needs to see are on the right track.)<br/>+ The more detail you can provide regarding your budget, your schedule, and other nitty-gritty details, the more likely they are to contribute.<br/><br/>Don't underestimate that last point. Crowdfunders are both customers, and venture capitalists, both at the same time.

But just to echo Adam on one very important point:\n<blockquote>I think you're smart to really map out how to approach a Kickstarter. A bunch of people have written helpful guides to successfully Kickstarting a project. Find them and grok them. Realize that <i>too much success</i> can bankrupt you, if you haven't planned for it.

A simple place to start might be to check out <a href="https://plus.google.com/105843491826683668595" rel="nofollow">Fred Hicks's Google+ feed</a>, as I've noticed he's been posting some helpful links and commentary related to Kickstarter since the FATE Core/Accelerated crowdfunding campaign. Issues of scaling your production are especially important; I've read some people suggest that your stretch goals should always be to improve production values rather than adding additional products, or even that you should put a hard cap on the numbers of physical products you sell, as you can jeopardize your entire campaign if your manufacturers/printers can't keep up with an order ten times the size of the one you first proposed to them. (And don't forget that international shipping costs are monstrous.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419070/#Comment_419070" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-26T07:18:28+00:00" title="July 26, 2013  7:18AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, thanks to all of you. I'll be more explicit for what I'm searching for, while answering your comments.\n<blockquote>Sure, I guess, though this is a community about play and not about design. There's the Praxis forum (see the link at the top of the site) but it's hardly used. Still, if people are interested in your project, they'll give feedback here.</blockquote>\nYes, I know this community is generous. That said, for my part, design is finish, I still need to run some tests, but it would be mostly to produce videos (we're planning on producing <i>a lot </i>of videos, short ones). My concern, today, is more about marketing (that's beyond "publishing", I'm not looking on "how to produce", but "how to sell" ; or almost "pre sell" in the case of KickStarter). I guess the old "publishing" forum of the forge would have been a good place for that ...\n<blockquote>I'm not sure what you're asking, regarding "collective intelligence," though. Explain?</blockquote>\nI've spent over a hundred hours lately about kickStarter. In fact, this is a skill we want to develop for our web agency, an expertise we would be able to "resell". <br/>That said, video games, boardgames are largely documented and there is a lot of successful examples around. Benchmark is very easy. TT rpg are a little trickier ... There are less common, less money is involved ... <br/>Anyway, what I meant by "collective intelligence" is "as a community, how far goes your knowledge about kickStarter in the context of TT rpg".<br/>For instance, for designing a rpg game, the "collective intelligence" of the indie community is very important : there are resources that can tell you "how to", what works, what are the common mistakes to avoid. I think Fred's Hick g+ feed is that kind of stuff. People just openly exchanging about what they did : what worked and what didn't.<br/>About kickStarter and my project, please bear in mind my specifics :<br/>- it is about TT rpg<br/>- the "campaign", Avalanche, looks like a comic<br/>- the "system", Shadow and Light, looks a boardgame<br/>- the "website/mobile application" is not far away from video games (not exactly, but ...)<br/>So, I have a lot of ground to cover and I can "hit" from various angles. And this is going to be <i>a lot </i>of money (I'm doing the drill, but it looks like a starting point of 60/80K and a stretch that goes to 1.2/1.5M).\n<blockquote>- what kind of exposure/interest do kickstarter campaign about rpg projects do get in the community ?<br/><br/>I dunno. Enough to make lots of money? People "share" stuff that is interesting.</blockquote>\nIt would be my job to make that look exciting ? It makes sense, I guess ...\n<blockquote>- are there other communities (i.e. sites) I should be addressing that would be defined as media ?<br/><br/>I don't know what you're looking for here.</blockquote>\nMedias are not your direct customers ... They are people that can take your message to others, potential customers. They are people that can influence others.\n<blockquote>Also, people now post about design less, and they tend to do it on blogs and G+. </blockquote>\nG+ ? Really ? About blogs, this is what I mean for media. They are people who have a blog, an audience, and post about interesting projects ...\n<blockquote>I think you're smart to really map out how to approach a Kickstarter. A bunch of people have written helpful guides to successfully Kickstarting a project. Find them and grok them. Realize that too much success can bankrupt you, if you haven't planned for it</blockquote>\nYeap, that's what I'm doing. And by the way, <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/12/18/hacking-kickstarter-how-to-raise-100000-in-10-days-includes-successful-templates-e-mails-etc/" rel="nofollow">this is one of the most interesting article I've read</a>. But, once you're read and understand the "beast", you have to do your homework : find your media, prepare your material, get the word around. The first 48h of your campaign are crucial. <br/>As for producing, I know this is a real issue, and this is how I address it :<br/>- That's the main reason I want to use my web agency : we have done websites and I can show some success (I'm not a lonely guy in his basement)<br/>- I'm a project manager as my real job : I know how to budget stuff and have them done (that is my special skill). That said, I know how to do it and find it hard for KickStarter ... so, I guess it is nearly impossible for other people to estimate rightly.\n<blockquote>Map out your stretch goals in advance so you can react to the pace of your Kickstarter. </blockquote>\nI do have them ready : I just need to "layout it" (have a designer and "information architect" give it a good look).\n<blockquote>If you have a cool idea that's worth getting excited about, and you can prove you won't disappoint, people will get excited!<br/>As for other places to promote, you might consider the RPGNet forums. And Google+ communities seem to be pretty active.</blockquote>\nI do have a concern about RPGNet : I do believe my customers are there and there is a large crowd there. When I go there, I want to be "right on track". I don't see it as a place to experiment or get feedback.<br/>What I'm looking for at the moment is a place (somehow quiet, filled with professionals) to experiment : show my stuff, get feedback, measure and adjust. We already do it in the web agency : not all employees are role players, but we write a FAQ, everyone reads it. We get immediate feedback and make adjustment.<br/>I'll check out G+, thanks for the info.<br/><br/>About my campaign, here's some parts of the strategy :<br/>- everything will be known beforehand : my stretch goals, my perks level, our video(s), even my kickStarter page will be public before we launch.
