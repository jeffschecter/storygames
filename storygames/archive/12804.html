A guy in search of his true mother was out-stalked by his deadly foe inside a carnival tent, and died at her feet. Total PVP.<br><br>In a looser system, say Archipelago II, it'd go like this:<br><br>JASON: I sneak up and stab your dude in the heart.

Maybe negotiate with the player to establish what various degree sof success meant in advance. I've also played in settings where there was a "Sense Danger" ability, in which case this sort of thing could be contested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288462/#Comment_288462" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T08:46:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  8:46AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After some thought, I think I missed the core issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am starting to think players new to indie/hippy games which require engagement in a scene-- have a default avoidance reaction, and that reaction becomes a "sneak/hide" in the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, where the GM frames a tight scene, with people in conflict with each other-- calling out for a player move their player into the fray.  And then I get, "I hide and make sure they don't see me," reactions from players.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fictional component of being "hidden" but it is mirroring their own desire to hide from the game itself--<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a poor scene framing skill on my part?  Poor communication of expectations?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions/observations would be helpful.

In the most recent case I put another PC that had conflicting best interests in the scene.  Both characters then shifted to the "hide."  So I had to move my NPC to take concrete action.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did eventually get the scene going-- once we resolved the hide/sneak portion, the conflict went ok--not great.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat first part of "hiding" just seemed wonky to me. I had to go to the dice to resolve it.  But the way the dice resolved it seemed strange. Players were narrating "sensing" something there-- so at that point the other player was, technically, no longer hidden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288492/#Comment_288492" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T10:48:55+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 10:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, that's interesting.<br><br>But in some way, it makes some sense.<br><br>Say I aim to find the Jewel of Ochra (whatever). You ask me what scene I want, I say I want a scene in a temple, praying the gods for good fortune. Total color scene. Or, possibly, refreshment scene, but lets say its purely color.<br><br>Then you send in rival npc. Well, maybe be *I* wouldn't hide, but, if you think about it, why wouldn't I?

You're just praying? You don't want to use any abilities or secrets? Otherwise, it's just a color scene, which is fine, you know, but we only got a few hours, we might as well start rolling... <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>-Okay, but what can I use at the temple?<br/>-Well, you know, maybe is the high priest a famous scholar. He might know the whereabouts of the jewel. You could go ask him?<br/>-Sure!<br/>-Except Nefarious NPC rival is already in the antichamber with the high priest, he's got a knife, and looks menacing.<br/>-I hide!<br/>-Okay, if you want, but it's getting violent.<br/>-Can I hear what he's saying?<br/>-Sure! "Now that you've told me all I wanted to know, I should make sure you won't tell anyone else, dontcha think?<br/><br/>Of course, it's more fun when players are more proactive. And when they don't welcome your contribution to the story.<br/><br/>-I'm in a store.<br/>-Bad guy comes in.<br/>-I hide!<br/>-Okay, bad guy leaves. He didn't see you.<br/>-Good. Back to shopping!<br/>-Indeed. Thank god we've avoided a potentially interesting scene with your nemesis!<br/><br/>But it's understandable that they would be prudent, especially if they are used to more deadly games. Once they figure out character death can be avoided easily in this game, they might be more willing to take risks. I suggest, above all, you have a talk  with them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
