Indeed there are well-over 100 issues.<br/><br/>How can I explain the significance of this?  FemForce is a comic that was always just sort of -there-.  My eye has passed-over FemForce on the sales racks for Three Fucking Decades without EVER lingering or giving it a second thought.  (Ok, maybe one time, my pubescent-self flipped through it, was disappointed that it wasn't -more- pornographic, and then dismissed it forever from my thoughts.)<br/><br/>FemForce arrived in the early 1980's when upstart companies like Eclipse, First, Pacific, and AmeriComics vied for a 'distant third' place after Marvel and DC.<br/>And the comics they published weren't all that far from Marvel and DC's fare.  There was a pretense of being a tad more college-y or discerning, but we're still talking superheroes or sword-barbarians or space adventurers.  'Alternative' comics came later.<br/><br/>FemForce's niche was that it was a little more buxom than Marvel and DC.<br/>Tame wank material for fanboys.<br/><br/>That's a blandly-solid niche, and it positioned FemForce nicely for when the late '80s b&amp;w Indie glut arrived.<br/><br/>But it's downright amazing the FemForce kept an audience all the way thru the 90's, when shiny, spherical boobs glistened on countless Marvel and DC and Image covers; and actual pornographic comics arrived that made FemForce look limp.     And thru the 00's, when FemForce's analog art style looks increasingly dated and clunky.<br/><br/>And yet, it remains.   Go figure.<br/><br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>So this week an RPG.net review of <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14764.phtml" rel="nofollow">Super Babes: The FemForce Role-Playing Game</a> (1993) caught my eye.<br/><br/>I'd never seen this game.  I've only read the review.  The most interesting part is description of a mechanic called BIMBO POINTS:<br/><br/><i><br/>"Next you get to \u201ca statistic that is thoroughly unique to the Super Babes system, BIMBO POINTS!\u201d This is of course the game's other main example of \u201cgenre simulation.\u201d On one hand it simulates those gray-area power stunts that \u201ccrunch\u201d games don't do very well; mechanically you can tell the GM to give you one Bimbo Point (BP) so that you can perform an action you can normally roll and have it succeed automatically. Agreeing to take TWO BPs means you can perform \u201c(a)ny action that is not covered by the rules that a character wants to perform\u201d. You can only earn up to 3 BP per session, \u201cthough why anyone would want more is beyond us.\u201d <br/>See, the drawback is that at the beginning of each game, the GM rolls a d20 for each character and if the number is under the character's current BP total, she suffers a random Bimbo Event (BE). This is rolled on a percentile chart, with some events being both cheesy and predictable (character is sexually harassed by superior), some being a bit less predictable (character accused of sexual harassment) and some being potential threats to the character and her team, such as 'cult begins worshiping character' which could be a REAL problem if combined with 'cult decides they must sacrifice character'.<br/>The book points out that in the comics, the limits of a game system wouldn't apply, only the limits placed on the character by the writer and/or editor, so again, the mechanic covers such \u201cspecial\u201d events while limiting the power this gives the player by forcing the PC to accept the consequences for going outside the \u201crules\u201d by means of another plot contrivance, this time going against her. <br/>This is actually a fairly innovative mechanic in its own way-- in fact it predates the \u201cFATE Point\u201d mechanic by over a decade. The problems with the label being obvious; one, the mechanic is also used by male characters who are not bimbos (although they mention the mystic Green Lama as an example of someone whose near-omnipotent magic also ends up creating several complications for him), by female characters who are not bimbos (like Nightveil/Blue Bulleteer) and female characters who are not bimbos but who are objectified and/or the victims of comic misfortunes (like Yankee Girl). <br/>In fact, Flare, from the aforementioned Heroic Publishing, is probably the best example of an actual bimbo in this sub-genre: She's highly sexual, and while possessed of high native intelligence, doesn't always seem to apply common sense, and both factors end up causing her problems."</i><br/><br/>Going only by this description, I think Bimbo Points might be more feminist that the reviewer allows.  Thematically, Bimbo Points seem to say that "if you agree to play-along with society's sexist stereotypes when it's to your advantage; then it might become habit, and you'll keep acting like a bimbo, even when it's no longer to your advantage."<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm giving schlock too much credit.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267289/#Comment_267289" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T09:37:52+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  9:37AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That'd depend on which view of feminism you subscribe to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267299/#Comment_267299" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T09:56:56+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  9:56AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yikes!<br/><br/>The main thing I can't stop thinking as that I WOULD want to earn a full 20 points every session. <br/><br/>The stuff they describe as a "downside" doesn't sound all that terrible: more like the typical stuff that would happen to you anyway in an interesting game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parke" title="Parke"><img alt="Parke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v97/mikker/Zoosmell.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parke">Parke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267367/#Comment_267367" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T18:17:34+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  6:17PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "Bimbo Point" name seems intentionally antagonistic.

You were either normal (default), attractive (Com 12-15, +1d6 for Pre attacks), beautiful (Com 16-20, +2d6 for Pre attacks), or gorgeous (Com 20+, +3d6 for Pre attacks). Your costume was either normal (bodysuit, nothing very sexy; no bonus), revealing (usual "bathing suit" costume, +1d6 for Pre attacks), skimpy (lotsa cleavage, thigh-high boots, typical "fanservice"; +2d6 for Pre attacks), or scandalous (something only the "slutty supervillianess" would wear, or maybe Witchblade in some of her more scanty moments; +3d6 for Pre attacks). This means that if you're Gorgeous and wear a Scandalous costume, you get +6d6 to your Pre attacks. Not bad."</i><br/> <br/>So the game draws a distinction between literal "empowerment" via exploiting one's sexuality<br/>vs.<br/>crossing some line into Scandalous or Bimbo territory.<br/><br/><br/>In "Backlash", Susan Faludi describes the paradox faced by business-women who have to avoid feminine attire (to some ill-defined extent) so that they will be considered 'professional', while not crossing the (ill-defined) line into being considered 'too masculine'.<br/><br/>At least, SuperBabes offers enough mechanical Crunch that such boundaries are clearly drawn, even if the basis for the boundaries is suspect.  I bet the lines would be blurrier in actual play than on the character sheet.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that playing FemForce according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_girl_art" rel="nofollow">Good Girl Art</a> conventions that spawned the game, would sidestep controversy.   Just like playing Maid works as long as nobody questions the entire idiom.<br/><br/>Playing FemForce as-written, but without a feel for Good Girl Art conventions would lead to disputes about the boundaries between concepts like Skmpy and Scandalous.<br/><br/>However, I also think that those same rocky moments would be Thematic Gold for that breed of Narrativist who loves exploring the ambiguity of social/ethical/moral boundaries. The fact that the game could EASILY be played that way suggests that the rules aren't just plain stoopid. <br/>In fact, is there a BETTER game for exploring gender roles in superhero comics?  This one has all the right details to crash into.<br/><br/>It's a tool that could be used for (a certain kind of) feminist good, or for what (some versions of) feminism would consider evil.    So maybe it's chaotic good.<br/><br/>Or , again, maybe just schlock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267610/#Comment_267610" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T14:13:22+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  2:13PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am I the first woman to speak up in this thread?<br/><br/>Man.

If a woman came up with the system it's feminist, if a man came up with it it's not.

Women are the biggest sexists out there, because we're the ones who teach our daughters what is acceptable feminine behavior and what is not. Seriously, when I worked at a science museum for a year I really became aware of the sexism that women perpetrate on their own daughters. Also, for another example of women being hugely sexist, see Stephanie Meyer. (OMG Twilight is the most sexist piece of media I've consumed in like ten years!)<br/><br/>...And this is why I hesitated to speak up. I tried to do it with humor, by calling attention to the fact that I was a woman. But why is it that whenever women speak up about sexism, there's the tendency to dismiss their comments with "well that's because you're a woman"?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NomdePlume</cite>I can't help thinking that, if you used this exact same mechanic in, say, Spirit of the Century, replaced the name Bimbo Points to Pulp Genre Reinforcement Points (or maybe Fate Points - that's sounds snappy!), and otherwise used it exactly as listed, with no reference to the gender of the affected character, it would work perfectly.</blockquote>\nSexual violence is not one of the possible outcomes in SotC, however.

If the outcomes were limited to humorous or inconvenient outcomes, then that would be a totally different kettle of fish.<br/><br/>I think we need to consider that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, that we shouldn't second guess its motives and intent and assume that it might be a cow trying to live as a duck.

This led to decades of censorship via the Comics Code Authority.<br/><br/>There's a passage in the book where Wertham compares the Golden Age hero Blue Beetle to a nightmare creature out of Kafka, quoting a disturbed 7-year old who recounted the Blue Beetle's transformation from an insect into a man.<br/><br/>One problem with Wertham's critique is that outside of the imagination of this disturbed 7-year old, Blue Beetle NEVER actually took insect form in the comics or newspaper strip or radio serial.<br/><br/>I think we'd be smart to avoid critique of FemForce that's as guess-based as Wertham's take on Blue Beetle.<br/>Or maybe not?  Maybe it's ok to judge a book by its cover when the cover says PRURIENT TRASH in giant letters.<br/><br/>--<br/>I just caught the end of Watchmen on teevee.<br/><br/>The character Nite Owl is based on Blue Beetle.<br/>The old man Nite Owl, Hollis Mason, is based on the 1930's Blue Beetle,<br/>which was a rip off of pulp heroes like the Green Hornet, the Shadow, and the Phantom.<br/><br/>And Watchman's Dan Dreiberg, the younger Nite Owl, is based on the 1964 Blue Beetle created by<br/>Steve Ditko (after he quit Spider-Man because of Stan Lee's editorial interference in <br/>Ditko's  Ayn Rand-influenced storylines.)<br/>And there are echoes of the anti-comic book Senate hearings in Watchmen's fictional "Keene Act",<br/>in which Congress banned superheroes.<br/><br/>Alan Moore wrote Watchmen around the time FemForce comics were on newstands.  <br/>Wikipedia says Alan Moore wrote an essay condemning 'Good Girl Art' a la FemForce.<br/>But Watchmen also features two versions of the Silk Spectre-- a female character<br/>depicted as a WW2 pin-up girl; and her daughter, <br/>who is a latex/fetish clad ass-kicker Good Girl Art archetype of FemForce vintage.<br/><br/>Watchmen is better reading than FemForce, but the differences are a matter of Degree; not Type.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">If you call women Bimbos (even just some women)- you aren't being feminist.

But it's late and I can't sleep so I'll say "but,.." and keep typing:<br/><br/>30 years after the Senate hearings against comic books, the PMRC held Senate hearings accusing pop music of similar bad influence on youth.  The congressional wives of the PMRC often cited sexism in lyrics.  There's a great episode of Crossfire,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ISil7IHzxc" rel="nofollow">available on YouTube,</a> (WHICH REAAALY LOOKS LIKE A CLIP FROM THE WATCHMAN MOVIE!) where some grumpy old men complain that Van Halen's "Hot For Teacher" promotes pedophilia; and Frank Zappa replies by saying, "Kiss my ass".  That's an exact quote.  If I recall correctly, Zappa then defends short, crude words as getting right to the point.<br/><br/>Susie Bright labels herself a bimbo. Laura Dern half-claims the word.  I'm such a dick, that I just googled "Katha Pollitt" + bimbo site: thenation.com; hoping to catch her using the word.   The only usage in her column condemns the bimbo stereotype-- she doesn't use it against other women.  Cool.<br/><br/>There's an awesome book by Paul Fussell called 'Class' which says hating crude, little words like bimbo-- is a Middle Class Thing, and Upper &amp; Lower class folks aren't afraid to use 'vulgar' terms.  Because the Upper are confident that they aren't vulgar, and the Lower don't deny their own vulgarity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267728/#Comment_267728" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-18T23:59:18+00:00" title="April 18, 2010 11:59PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ignotus</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>My point was generally feminists will consider an opinion of a woman to be valid, and an opinion of a man to be invalid when it comes to feminism.

Women are the biggest sexists out there, because we're the ones who teach our daughters what is acceptable feminine behavior and what is not. Seriously, when I worked at a science museum for a year I really became aware of the sexism that women perpetrate on their own daughters. Also, for another example of women being hugely sexist, see Stephanie Meyer. (OMG Twilight is the most sexist piece of media I've consumed in like ten years!)</blockquote>\nBy sexist I assume you mean noting differences between the sexes? Or are using sexist as the little twin of misogynist?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite><br/>...And this is why I hesitated to speak up. I tried to do it with humor, by calling attention to the fact that I was a woman. But why is it that whenever women speak up about sexism, there's the tendency to dismiss their comments with "well that's because you're a woman"?</blockquote>\nAny time someone calls something out as being sexist there's going to be a quick self check on whether what you just said was sexist. You'll either come to the conclusion that yes it was sexist or no, you don't feel it was. If it's the latter, and it happens more than a few times dismissing it probably will be the reaction. The other time is when it technically is sexist but really doesn't matter. "Women are shorter than men." "Hey, that's sexist!" WTF is she complaining about that for? Get hit with a few of those and you stop bothering to check if it's a legitimate complaint.

This. <br/><br/>That's not to say I'm anti-superheroes. I loved, loved, LOVED the Superman, Batman, and Spiderman animated series when I was a kid. And I was totally obsessed with X-Men.

Is there some other secret meaning that I failed to deduce?<br/><br/>To contribute something on-topic, I actually think the mechanic is pretty cool, in the "every time you supercharge your abilities, you create trouble for yourself".  If you try to read the mechanic as having a purpose other than simulationism, you could come up with whatever you want.  There's the "dark" reading, mentioned above, in which empowerment =&gt; suffering.  There's another reading you could do, where being a superhero means a breakdown in terms of the conventions of femininity (Oh no! bad hair day!), and how the character responds to this dynamic is what's relevant.  Ultimately, though, I think that's kind of purposeless.  It's a mechanic to simulate the source material, it does a good job, and accordingly it's about as feminist as the source material - which is to say, not particularly.  By changing the ways you accumulate points, and changing what the consequences are, you could make everything from a morality play to an awesome pulp situation generator.  Context gives the mechanic its meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267800/#Comment_267800" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T09:49:32+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  9:49AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>And such suspicion isn't limited to women listeners either.

Y'see, <i>Red Tornado</i> wasn't meant to be taken seriously, she's really a contemporary parody of superheros. <br/><br/>In the golden age, comic magazines would contain a mix of features in every issue (rather than just the single story they usually do now). Several short comic stories of different genres (detective, western, strange adventure), a couple short prose fictions, and usually  some pages of gags or comedy strips with an eccentric cast of characters very much like those of <i>Popeye</i> or <i>Lil Abner</i>. One of those comedy strips was <i>Scribbly</i>, about a kid in the city aspiring to be a cartoonist and his relatives and neighborhood friends. After the superhero features started to eclipse the others in popularity, the writer of Scribbly had one of the supporting characters, ole' "Ma" Hunkel, overhear some kids raving about <i>Green Lantern</i> comics* and decide to deal with the local gangsters by taking the mystery man approach.<br/><sub><br/>*doubly cheeky because Green Lantern appeared in the same magazines as Scribbly, and even though he's spoken of as a fictional character Red Tornado would later meet him and the rest of the JSA in person.</sub><br/><br/>Red Tornado is pretty much intended to invert everything that had been established about superheroes at the time:<br/>*Superheroes are invariably young viral men / RT is a cantankerous mature woman.<br/>*Costumes are dashing and fancy /  RT's costume is an old pot and long underwear. <br/>*Adventures are grand and happen in exotic locales / RT beats up swindlers in the local neighborhood.<br/>*Heroes have superpowers or are supercompetent / RT is just a big brawler.<br/>* Heroes have incredible secret lairs / RT lives in a tenement.<br/>*Superheroes are <i>serious</i> / RT's stories are comedic.<br/><br/>To try and make this at least somewhat discussion-relevant, its arguable that despite its seeming innocuousness, Red Tornado is sexist in its own way, in that the idea of woman superhero (or  least not a "pretty girl" one) was seen as so inherently ridiculous that it could only appear in comedy stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
