But I have a recurring problem with it... long silences while players get caught up writing on the cards. These silences are undesirable because players tend to start chatting about other things during them, and this loses the momentum of the game.<br/><br/>The rules stress that the index cards are just memory aids, and that players should speak first write second (by implication, when the next player is speaking); however I have found that about 60% of players treat the index cards as their primary input into the game. (My sample size is 20 odd players. I play this game a *lot*.) Some even write multiple sentences on the cards.<br/><br/>I have tried getting new players to read the rules on this topic out loud, leading by example, reminding people at the start of their turn that the cards should only be a few words, and even keeping the index cards out of reach and handing them out only after someone has spoken\u2014players found this last tactic very intrustive and irritating.<br/><br/>Weirdly, I have never had this problem with A Quiet Year, even though it also involves extensive penmanship. I find the next player naturally begins their turn while the previous player is drawing on the map.<br/><br/>Has anyone else had this issue, or is it peculiar to my own circle of gamers? Any suggestions? Am I missing something obvious here? <br/><br/>One thing I might try (stolen from a Tarot game I am playtesting at the moment) is to have the player who last took a turn be in charge of writing the card, not the player whose turn it actually is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463149/#Comment_463149" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T15:47:02+00:00" title="May  8, 2017  3:47PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have noticed this problem.

And small cards, as Caroline said. I use 2x3 inch flash cards.<br/><br/>When I teach Microscope, I write all the cards so I can demonstrate how little needs to go on a card and precisely so people don't get distracted by writing. I explain that what I write on the cards is genuinely not important, it's just a reminder. What you say to the other players is what matters. The cards will never capture all the details, nor do they need to. But some people will prefer to write their own cards, particularly in a less heavily facilitated session where everyone already knows Microscope, and that's fine.<br/><br/>The real solution is "<b>talk before you write</b>". It's not just a good idea, it's essential to playing Microscope well. Describe everything you need to describe (including any backtracking or revisions when you realize you're not describing exactly what you mean), answer any clarifying questions, describe why it's light or dark -- the works -- before you even pick up the pen. No exceptions. Your job is to talk to the players, not the cards.<br/><br/>It's then much easier to quickly summarize something on the card when you've already explained it and hashed out any details. No one is anxious waiting to see if you even have an idea and the next player is free to start thinking about what they're making while you're writing (it gives them a little more time to think, which is useful in avoiding hesitation on their turn). In fact everyone can take the time while the person is writing to think about how it fits into the history, etc. The time spent writing becomes reflective instead of awkward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463274/#Comment_463274" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-11T18:17:35+00:00" title="May 11, 2017  6:17PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff, Ben.

Our regular Whitehack group had multiple players that couldn't attend, so we picked this as a one-shot alternative. The bookends of our story were the founding and the destruction of Atlantis, where Atlantis turned out to be a military power constantly fighting the kingdoms of Lemuria and Mu and others.<br/><br/>On the whole the session went very well, but we had some small problems with writing on the cards. One thing was that we had "Strong characters" in the Yes column, in the sense of Game of Thrones main characters, people with names, positions, and agendas. If we introduced someone in a scene we required an actual name, but the problem was that if we spoke first, when it was time to write down if the corporal was called Menchonon, or Menochon, or Mechoton, we sometimes couldn't remember. We had to pick a new name to write on the card, which felt odd and made the character feel more made up on the spot than real. That's why we sometimes cheated a bit and paused while talking to write the first part of the question with the name and then continued narrating. We also started keeping one index card each per scene where we jotted down names and other details as the current creator spoke, so we could remind them when it was time to write the card for the timeline.<br/><br/>Another problem was that as the person was writing the card, it was *really* hard to not offer suggestions of connections to other cards. The other players obviously mulled over what was just said, and as you recognized connections you so badly wanted to blurt them out. We where squirming in our seats not to break the "no suggestions" rule. I think it's a very good and powerful rule for this game, but it also made for moments of frustration. Good frustration, I guess, as we where obviously all invested.<br/><br/>I've played other games online with one of the players and we usually have a shared Google sheet with notes and stats. When it's his turn, he sometimes, or usually, writes first and then speaks. This is extra frustrating, because you feel like something gets written in stone before you had a chance to understand what's going on. You see what's written and start making assumptions that might turn out to be wrong. And if you write and speak at the same time, you're describing something to the card or to yourself rather than the group, so I think "speak first, write later" is a central rule to enforce. We wrote our own cards and it didn't cross our minds to write for each other. If we'd done that, I'd still enforce the rule that you need to speak first.<br/><br/>None of this were huge problems for us, just minor things where I think our personal note cards and holding our tongues and waiting for our turn to speak solved most of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463302/#Comment_463302" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-12T23:33:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2017 11:33PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a scene I *do* write down each step as it's completed (the question, the setting, etc). Say the question, hash it out, revise it if necessary, then write it down and start the next step, instead off waiting to do all the steps of scene creation before writing anything down. Sorry if that was confusing. Scene setup is very different from Events and Periods, since it's all prepping us for the role-playing, instead of stand-alone narration. And yes, if you need to jot down a name there's nothing wrong with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463323/#Comment_463323" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-13T22:55:29+00:00" title="May 13, 2017 10:55PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" rel="nofollow">horn_head_o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I don't quite agree with that conclusion - I'd actually think it was the reverse. For new players, it's a very tangible mark of something that they created and shows their impact on the game, while experienced players often might not need that physical action to substantiate their contribution.<br/><br/>Also, in the writing of the shorthand version of a card, an author and an observer might pick out different key details from the scene to emphasise on the card, which is where I might feel like my toes were stepped on.</p></div></blockquote>\nI can see that too, but the time-consuming compulsion to write out key details on the card is precisely what I'm trying to eliminate! <br/><br/>The satisfaction players get from making a tangible card-sized contribution is probably a big cause of the writing-too-much block. Perhaps also a certain shyness? I guess it feels less exposing to write down the contribution than to speak it with eye contact and whatnot.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" rel="nofollow">Ben_Robbins</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Big markers = clever! And small cards, as Caroline said. I use 2x3 inch flash cards.<br/><br/>When I teach Microscope, I write all the cards so I can demonstrate how little needs to go on a card and precisely so people don't get distracted by writing. I explain that what I write on the cards is genuinely not important, it's just a reminder. What you say to the other players is what matters. The cards will never capture all the details, nor do they need to. But some people will prefer to write their own cards, particularly in a less heavily facilitated session where everyone already knows Microscope, and that's fine.<br/><br/>The real solution is "<b>talk before you write</b>". It's not just a good idea, it's essential to playing Microscope well. Describe everything you need to describe (including any backtracking or revisions when you realize you're not describing exactly what you mean), answer any clarifying questions, describe why it's light or dark -- the works -- before you even pick up the pen. No exceptions. Your job is to talk to the players, not the cards.<br/><br/>It's then much easier to quickly summarize something on the card when you've already explained it and hashed out any details. No one is anxious waiting to see if you even have an idea and the next player is free to start thinking about what they're making while you're writing (it gives them a little more time to think, which is useful in avoiding hesitation on their turn). In fact everyone can take the time while the person is writing to think about how it fits into the history, etc. The time spent writing becomes reflective instead of awkward.</p></div></blockquote>\nI couldn't agree more with "<b>talk before you write</b>". My problem is that there's a tendency in my gaming circles not to follow this rule, so I'm looking for a way to make sure they do!<br/><br/>I really like the idea that the facilitator should write all the cards. It's less complicated than having a rotating writing system that's different from the normal turn order.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jonas Ferry" rel="nofollow">Jonas Ferry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Another problem was that as the person was writing the card, it was *really* hard to not offer suggestions of connections to other cards. The other players obviously mulled over what was just said, and as you recognized connections you so badly wanted to blurt them out. We where squirming in our seats not to break the "no suggestions" rule. I think it's a very good and powerful rule for this game, but it also made for moments of frustration. Good frustration, I guess, as we where obviously all invested.</p></div></blockquote>\nHa! A lot of players here break the no-suggestions rule too, but I don't think it's as disruptive to the game. If a player asks for help or is hesitant for longer than usual, I usually jump in with the list of questions from the 'I Don't Know What to Make!' section in <i>Explorer</i>, thereby stopping anyone else making a concrete suggestion.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
