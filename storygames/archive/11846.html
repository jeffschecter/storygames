Even people in the "right" age group/demographic - that is, white middle-class guys who were teens when role-playing was at its most popular.<br/>Computer games are very popular, and some people associate "rollespill" (the word for RPGs over here) with CRPGs. <br/>Those who have heard of RPGs, but never played them, tend to fall into three groups: <br/>- "My son used to play those games with his friends. They seemed to have a lot of fun. I never quite understood what they were doing, though."<br/>- "Role-playing games? That's pretty geeky, haha! I've got cool sneakers and cool friends and like snowboarding."<br/>- "I've never tried... it looks like you have to be real creative?"<br/><br/>I very rarely meet people with negative attitudes. They tend to be grey-haired conservative leader types who read some scary headlines in the 90s (there was a brief flare of fringe religious anti-gaming sentiment that spread to the media), and are generally suspicious towards youth culture and <i>the chaos that lives in our society just waiting to take over!!!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264453/#Comment_264453" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T03:02:45+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  3:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty much that.<br/><br/>But also:<br/><br/>4.

Teenagers might understand the term from playing computer games like Dragon Age (now) and Baldur's Gate (then). This is usually a great pool to get players from, since a lot of them favor computer rpgs over other games.<br/>I don't think the major rpg boom in the 80s affected Greece at all. The few that did play back then where usually really hardcore about it (they had to order their books from the US, tight knit communities).<br/><br/>There have been a couple of occasions where terrible channels (actually, 2 of the 5 top channels, they're just terrible in quality) had reports of rpgs linked to Satanism and the occult. One of them was in order to promote someone's terrible conspiracy book. Among other things, it mistakenly took the Humanity scores from Vampire and presented it as a goal board.<br/>Kill a baby? 9 Points!<br/><br/>Sweden:<br/>A lot of people know about them I think. I've asked people if they play and they've said no, but they know about them and how they work.<br/>I did find a terrible little book in the library talking about the evils of roleplaying, by a ''child therapist''. It was wildly misinformed and more or less malicious in it's portrayal of rpgs, as it chose to include some really weird LARP games.

It is even more popular than being a boy scout - and has its own tv show for kids on weekend mornings. The parents love that their kids are not sitting in front of a video game all day. It is also so mainstream that it has been used for tv commercials (the one running currently is a guy winning in the lottery that spends money on a big scale larp).<br/><br/>When 'rollespil' does not take place in the woods, it takes place in front of a computer - or in the bedroom. Many people also encounter it as part of their professional training.<br/><br/>It means that people playing pen-and-paper/tabletop rpgs and story games have to be a bit careful with using the term 'rollespil'.<br/><br/>However, there is definately no stigmatism of roleplaying gamers in DK any more. It is even something you would write on your cv for a job application.<br/><br/>Edit: Here are some links:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0TlQphMuRg&amp;NR=1" rel="nofollow">Turn Off Your Phone - TDC Mobil</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_I1GXqawS8" rel="nofollow">Barda 2008</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264461/#Comment_264461" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T05:05:47+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  5:05AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweden was pretty badly hit by the 90s RPG scares, I think.

This all started in the 90's when there was a serial killer who has been called "el asesino del rol", "the role (player) murderer". He was a crazy nazi guy who happened to play a RPG he himself invented (which was about racial wars). The media ignored the crazy nazi part and jumped into the opportunity to talk about "our children being lured into playing dark macabre games about killing people" in countless sensationalistic talk-shows. Since then, whenever there is a mysterious or unsolved crime in Spain, the media says "it is suspected that it might have been a macabre role playing game". Despite no other crime related to RPGs has ever happened in Spain since then, we are still more feared than terrorists or the economic recession. Even my mother still believes that our RPG sessions somehow involve ritual killings, despite I tried to explain it to her like 500 times.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the people born in the 80's or later, it's just this game the nerds played in school instead of football (soccer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264558/#Comment_264558" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T15:47:13+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  3:47PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2010 3:48PM by Tristan.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mexico:<br><br>Most people would be:<br><br>1.

Having been to both coasts and lived in Ontario (A.K.A. the Real Canada) for decades, let me give you the full run-down.<br/><br/>I've been suprised to find how little Americans seem to know about Canada.  Now, granted, there are many similarities between our two nations but there are also subtle differences that give us our unique Canadian identity.  For example, in Canada, everyone hates Monte Cook, but in the US he seems to be quite popular.<br/><br/>There are other differences too.  I mean, we don't have Borders, we have Chapters.  We use the metric system, although this often isn't reflected in the published games.  <br/><br/>Canadians and Americans both love Moldvay Basic Dungeons and Dragons but in Canada the game is played slightly differently.  The board is a different size for one thing; a classic D&amp;D dungeon crawl is 17 miles long and 6 feet wide. So understandably games are a little longer, in fact the first session of the 1981 module Isle of Dread is still going on at the base of the C.N. Tower.<br/><br/>Many Americans believe that our playstyle is slightly removed and polite because we enjoy acting that way at conventions.  In fact we try as much as possible to use the ingredients list of a classic 1960s Kraft Dinner box to inspire and inform our basic interactions.  <br/><br/>Our social footprints differ somewhat in that Americans play RPGs with a single GM and several players.  In Canada, we always play with a small boy with supernatural powers.  Of whom we are all very fond.<br/><br/>In the United States adding sexual tension to a game is easy, since mommies and daddies have bipolar intercourse to procreate, and referencing this activity is sufficient.  Canadians however are a breed of hermaphrodites who reproduce by a means of auto-insemination, thus removing the need for sex.<br/><br/>This also explains why we don't really have a porn industry (except in Banff, which is for American tourists, and Montreal, which is very, very creative).<br/><br/>And of course, how could we discuss Canada without discussing the weather.  Yes, it is cold in Canada.  It is very very cold.  Are you happy now?  Yes, the average year-round temperature is 275 degrees below zero, but that is Celsius.  So we have lots of time indoors.  Now can we talk about something else?  For example the fact that our atmosphere is pure sulphur dioxide, which is of course incapable of sustaining life (life as you know it).  Or the fact that we only have gravity for 6 hours out of each day, and spend the rest of our time clinging desperately to trees to avoid being spun into the endless abyss of space.  Yeah, that cuts into our game time.<br/><br/>Yes, all this is true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264584/#Comment_264584" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T19:11:14+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  7:11PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe McDonald, as an entity, makes <i>so</i> much more sense to me now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264585/#Comment_264585" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T19:16:33+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  7:16PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2010 9:32PM by deadlytoque.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>I tell people about games and they say they're interested.<br/>It's the "2 to 4 hours" that floors them.</blockquote>\nThis is my Pan-Canadian (I've lived in 3 provinces and 2 of the 4 largest cities in the past decade or so) experience in a nutshell.

I've been remarkably lucky during my adult life.  Half of those people join out of a kind of jokey curiousity - "oh man, I've never played D&amp;D but I hear it's hilarious" and we have a really ridiculous time playing AD&amp;D and drinking beers for six hours.  The other half are already a little nerdy and take to indie games like crazy - "we only ever played D&amp;D and it got so boring just killing stuff all the time."  <br/><br/>The general populace, though?  I think it's much the same as any liberal community.  Just about everyone knows what an RPG is (above and beyond just Final Fantasy or WoW - they actually have heard of Dungeons and Dragons) and most laugh and say "man, I never played, but those nerds in high school sure seemed like they were having fun."<br/><br/>I am an unabashed nerd, though, and broadcast my geekiness happily to everyone I know.  I think maybe some part of it is that my enthusiasm is obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264595/#Comment_264595" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T21:22:14+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  9:22PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made a snide comment tersely hinting at what  Adam so thoughtfully and clearly broke down for ya'll: YEARNING FOR NERD GAMES.

It has disappeared in late 90 with the media buzz.<br/>The nolife aspect sticks, but mainly because now, RPG is greatly associated with MMORPG, and so nolifes. When you explain the social and imaginative face of a game (and you precise that members of your RPG association include French professors, artists and the like), the nolife visage fades away.<br/><br/>The majority is more like "uninterested" because games aren't what they look for, it's childish and vain.  Still, I'm surprised by the number of people that have no gamer/geek background who are curious about this hobby. I'm sure it proves that RPG/Storygames must cut the umbilical cord that ties them to wargames and fantasy.

My brother is into that."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"So you run around with fake swords and act like you're someone else? My cousin is into that."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"So you pretend to be like Batman in the bedroom? My parents are into that. You made me remember Curse mine eyes!"<br/><br/>So I usually say: "No. It's not like that. Do you know D&amp;D? Dungeons and Dragons?" To which about half respond:<br/><br/>"Oh yes. I played that once in high school. I think I played a vampire."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"Oh yes. My brother played it once when he was in high school. I think he played a vampire."<br/><br/>and the other half respond:<br/><br/>"Duh?"<br/><br/>But then there are, of course, a few people who I am glad and often surprised to discover that they do roleplay or used to roleplay. I have yet to find someone who links RPGs to Evil or to Satan, but that could be because only 10% of the people I mix with practise a religion such as Christianity, and of those, allmost all of them are pretty cool liberal folk anyway for whom Evil etc. is not part of their worldview. Almost everyone who knows what roleplaying is, including roleplayers themselves, consider RPGing to be exceptionally geeky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264639/#Comment_264639" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T07:31:51+00:00" title="March 31, 2010  7:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nocker</cite><br/>The majority is more like "uninterested" because games aren't what they look for, it's childish and vain.
