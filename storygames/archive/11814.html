Hi.I'm Jackwriter and I am gonna become a game designer.I have written these stories which are documents in word.Can anyone comment on this story game I have been working on?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis story is a project of D.N.It has only one chapter for now.I hope its good.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory:The story takes place around a Pagoda in Tokyo where Master Kharn wakes up his drunken student Yeaso Gotchya who dozed off.Kharn\u2019s brother shows up and battles Yeaso just to tease his brother\u2019s way of training his pupils.Kharn delays the match because Yeaso dosed of all of a sudden and Kamil leaves laughing.While Yeaso was sleeping, he had a vision of a squirrel with no eyes being attacked by bigger squirrels.And a bear taking over the lion\u2019s den.He wakes up and finds his master quite upset but  still smiled at Yeaso for some reason.Kharn asks him to get the items from the list and Yeaso gets them.While Yeaso was on his way to get the items, he sees a blind man being attacked by bullies.Yeaso saves him and the blind man allies since Yeaso told him that he has a great master who might help him a bit.Yeaso and Kalei reach to Disco\u2019s shop.They see strange ninjas who tried attacking Disco.Yeaso and Kalei tried to stop them but can\u2019t due to their invisibility.they were about to be killed until Disco uses his magic to shoo them off.Disco demands a fine from the two after seeing his broken glass which Yeaso and Kalei weren\u2019t involved.After paying, Disco gives the items that were on the list and teaches them how to use them.these contained a scrool and a dragon power to both.After learning they leave and noticed a  cop named Max FeuJack who recollects Yeaso at the bar and attacks him since Yeaso  knocked everyone at the bar and drove a car while being drunk.Max losses and deals with him later and leaves with his ferrari .Kalei then wonders whether Yeaso is a good or a bad person in his mind.The two then head back to the Pagoda and saw a shadow which flees at first.Kamil suddenly shows up and quickly informs Kharn to come to head to the top floor.When all have arrived,they notice the same shadow and it reveals itself as Dincky the lord of shadows.Dincky tried to connect the last piece fragment  of the morgan circle inorder for the dragon of the circle to grant him a wish.SuddenlyYeaso recollects his second vision and stops him by  destroying the shield, which to everyones surprise gets schattered to four different parts.not only that but it blows the pagoda and all of them get seperated.Max notices this and wonders if seeing Yeaso and Kalei was a blur or not and he continues talking about a serious criminal Rex Typhion to his friend Alec.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile Yeaso is stuck in a beach and he searches for Kalei.But he finds a boy stuck at the top of the tree.The boy tells Yeaso that he is his\u2026big fan.Yeaso was about to leave until the boy tells him he saw what he did and further tells him that he can help to get the four fragments of the Morgan circle and find his blind friend in exchange of Yeaso helping him to get down from the tree.Yeaso uses his ability \u201cNintusu\u201d to get him down.The boy reveals his name as Buddy Ratcher.The two find Kalei again being attacked by a shadow.Buddy then teaches them how to attack a shadow.After killing the shadow, Buddy tells the locations where the pieces are using his crystal.They are located in a tribal village,Japan, a museum in Tokyo and the sea side house(Where Rex Thyphion is located).The boy can\u2019t tell where Kharn and Kamil are so the three decide to get the pieces first.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter getting the four pieces, Yeaso,Kalei and Buddy receive a message from Dincky in Max\u2019s car(They stole it from Max after defeating Rex).If they fail to bring the pieces, He will kill Kharn and Kamil.So Yeaso and Kalei are forced to bring the pieces.After Dincky dissappears the pieces join together and dissapear to a location where Buddy lives.Buddy tells them that the circle must have chosen the right path to stay in Buddy\u2019s Pagoda.So Yeaso and co decide to save their masters.They find out that the shadow lives in a\u2026swamp.The two enter the tree while Buddy stays outside the swamp.The two noticed that Dincky already knows about the incident that happened after his message that the pieces dissappeared.So Dincky  traps the two into a game board.The only way to escape is to play the game.Dincky tells them the rules.The two can only move by rolling the dice.They have only five turns,if the turns are over they face a boss.Once a boss is defeated they resume with more turns.The maximum turns they can have is 20.Without further do they manage to reach the last point of the board.Yeaso grabs Kalei and uses his Nintusu to avoid the last space as it contained an explosive bomb at the bottom.Thinking them dead, Dincky laughs and blackmails the masters that if they don\u2019t tell him where the circle is, then he will kill them.Kharn with Kamil\u2019s cooperation, played a trick on Dincky telling him that since he killed Yeaso and Kalei, he can\u2019t find out where the circle is since those two knew it the whole time and if he killed Kharn and Kamil, he will never find out where the circle is which they refuse to tell.Dincky then stratches his head and mummbles what to do next. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile Yeaso and Kalei are teleported somewhere in the tree.The two solve puzzles and reach the top of the house where Dincky unnoticed still mummbles.The masters were surprised and tell the two to quickly get the key before Dincky sees them.But to their surprise Max\u2019s walkie talkie activates(Yeaso stole it from Max thinking that it was a cell phone) and Max voice was so loud that Dincky quickly looks behind and sees the two alive.Dincky at first thinks of getting Max to his side because of his outrage but when Max tells Yeaso that he\u2019s so drunken that his shadow  looks as dumb as he is, Dincky destroys the walkie talkie and says that shadows aren\u2019t dumb, and he shows his IQ from his high school(Which  shows 10/300.).Yeaso wonders if Dincky\u2019s game  caused his IQ to be so low. <br/>\n<br/>\nDincky then asks them where the circle is and Kalei tells him that even if he knew where it is, He and Yeaso won\u2019t let him fulfill his wish.Dincky tells them that there is more than getting the four pieces to get his wish but dosen\u2019t tell them a bit about it.Then Dincky casts a spell on kamil which turns him into a powerful version of himself.The new Kamil attacks Yeaso and Kalei while Dincky takes Kharn to the highest part.After Yeaso and Kalei defeat the new Kamil, Kamil regrets what he told to him in the past and realised that Kharn was a better master than him.He begged them to save him which they aggreed and he died\u2026smiling.They then reach the top floor where Dincky is and start their final battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter defeating Dincky,the two save Kharn and escape from the tree crumbling down.After the tree crashes down,Dincky\u2019s last words were that if he ever sees them again,he will seek his vengence and then figures out which wood goes to which inorder to rebuild his tree castle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe three head to where buddy is and he takes them to a bigger Pagoda where the circle is.After Kharn finishes weeping for his dead brother,Kalei asks him if Kharn can help him to be strong.Kharn aggrees and takes Kalei to a room where they begin talking.Yeaso tells Buddy about what Dincky said that there is more than getting the circle, Buddy takes a big book and reads it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the book there were once two dragons which were good and bad.the good dragon would always stop the bad one from destroying village after village while the bad one ignored the good one and continued his rampage.A wizard used a circle to cast a spell on the bad one but the good one saved the bad one\u2019s life and faced the spell.After that the bad dragon was never seen again and as for the good dragon, the wizard told it that the only way it can free itself was to grant the owner one wish it he/she desires.Because of this  people all over their villages started running to the wizard\u2019s circle for the wish.The wizard casted another spell to the circle turned the circle solid gray colour instead of the usual and coming out of the circle were nine gems which schattered.Hence no one ever saw the circle or the gems.The wizards name was Morgan thus calling the shield as the Morgan circle.Which means that Dincky will try to get the nine gems and then worry about the shield later.Yeaso decides that he and Kalei will get these gems no matter what happens and Buddy casts a spell all over the pagoda so that Dincky can\u2019t find the circle or the gems the two will get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game ends when Max sees his car without a scratch outside the swamp.As max was about to take the car out the car exploded.being furious Max will put those two to custody and demand fine from them the next time he encounters them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

It's not game design, but it's closely associated. Still not much to do with this site, of course.<br/><br/>Jack: if you want to write plot and dialogue for video games, not only you need to brush up on your game culture knowledge (this is totally the wrong place to start, for instance), but you also need to accept that you're likely not going to get into the vocation by writing game plots and offering them to game studios - it just doesn't work that way. Rather, what you need to do is to build up a writing portfolio (short stories, whatever - something to demonstrate your technical and artistic skill in writing) and a CV (ideally some publishing credit of any kind), and then start submitting these to likely game studios that routinely work on projects that engage separate plotters and dialogue writers (hint: those would be the largest studios, even a mid-range one will have the design team do most of the writing). Presumably at some point you might get into a new project that is staffed from outside the existing studio staff for whatever reason, but even then you won't be writing your own stuff: creating video games is teamwork, and a writer is nowhere near the top of the creative totem pole in the vast majority of the games. Thus your job likely wouldn't be to plan a game in the abstract, but rather to execute specific types of writing to spec - dialogue writing is a pretty typical example where somebody else has developed characters and plot, and it's your job to write this one scene to express a plot point or whatever. Over time a writer can of course widen his expertise in the industry to become a game designer or even developer, which then allows him actual high-level creative input into what the game will be like.<br/><br/>The only realistic way for a writer - or anybody, really - to get to call the shots in video game development is to start your own indie studio. That's a quite different proposition, but at least you have plenty of creative freedom. Of course, that sort of thing requires vastly more understanding of game creation processes than even being a professional in an established studio team does. Considering your showing so far, I recommend that you focus on improving your knowledge base on the game industry before worrying about anything else. Much will become clear that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jackwriter" title="Jackwriter"><img alt="Jackwriter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jackwriter">Jackwriter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264027/#Comment_264027" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T09:25:08+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  9:25AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2010 9:28AM by Jackwriter.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I happen to be an artist as well.Here let me show you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="Unti.png" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i759.photobucket.com/albums/xx234/Jackwriter/Unti.png"/><br/>\n<br/>\nIt may not be at a professional's level but at least its good(hopefully).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264032/#Comment_264032" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T09:55:09+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  9:55AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to break into video games, the absolute best thing you can do is:<br><br>1) Learn basic programming.<br>2) Start making your own short form games.

This is not to say that you can't start making games - like Andy suggests, it's great practice and constructive to just start making games, programming and all, instead of stalking in the sidelines. As we often say: play games, read about games, think about games, write games, and in time you'll improve as a game maker. Practice, practice, practice.<br/><br/>In case you want pointers on your writing, I suggest you look for a dedicated writing workshop - such exist in the Internet, too. They can show you how to structure and present your ideas in clear, striking manner appropriate to the work and the medium. The same goes for drawing, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264050/#Comment_264050" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T10:47:11+00:00" title="March 25, 2010 10:47AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>In case you want pointers on your writing, I suggest you look for a dedicated writing workshop - such exist in the Internet, too.</blockquote>\nExactly: Unfortunately, this forum is basically for discussing tabletop role-playing games (playing them, talking about them, etc). There's not that many people here qualified to discuss fiction writing, and there's no forum/topic here to provide writing feedback or writing-workshop style activities for fiction.<br/><br/>If you have tabletop talk, this is the place to do it, but unfortunately it isn't going to be much help as a place to get good feedback.

There's very little variation in sentence structure. Lots of spelling errors that weren't caught by the spell checker ("losses" for "loses", for example.)<br/>Overall, the prose has no sense of style or rhythm. It's about what I'd expect from a middle-school English class essay. It doesn't flow, it's not fun to read. Granted, this is just an outline and not a full story, but if this is what you're pitching to people, it has to be good reading in its own right or you won't get any further.<br/>The plot is really clich\xe9d. If I were a big fan of cheap B-grade action movies I might enjoy it anyway, but I'm not.<br/>You don't seem to have any knowledge of the cultures you're writing about, beyond clich\xe9s picked up from kung fu movies. (You say the setting is in Tokyo, but the overall setting seems Chinese. And the character names don't sound Asian at all.)<br/><br/>My overall reaction, to be honest, depends on how old you are. If you're, say, 15 or younger, you've definitely got talent and should work at it and seriously study the areas you're weak at. Above that age, I'd say you have some potential, and clearly lots of energy, but you really have to focus on learning the craft or you're not going to produce anything useable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
