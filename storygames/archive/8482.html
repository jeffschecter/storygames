I have a half hour commute that makes FoFGM perfect, whereas it's difficult to find an hour where I can sit and focus on a longer podcast.  I like actually listening to them instead of just having them play in the background.<br/><br/>Honestly, too, I like your general meditations on themes (perhaps inspired by a single game) better than episodes where you review a bunch of games in a row, but I think it's more of a question of where you want to go with the podcast and what your target audience is.  Honestly, it sounds like the podcast has been making <i>you</i> happier recently, and isn't that the most important thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187909/#Comment_187909" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T18:08:33+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  6:08PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Confession: I've never listened to a podcast in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, maybe one or two, but it was the only source of news about something I was interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've never listened to a gaming podcast.

Tropes of film noir. Interesting. OK.<br><br>I wasn't sure about 32, which was about story structure in games. There were a couple of interesting points, but not quite enough to last the length of the podcast. It didn't quite feel as though you had a handle on what you wanted to say.<br><br>I liked 33. There was a much clearer line of thought. It made me wonder whether there's too much emphasis on story and not enough on the process of telling the story. That's good.

I listen to a variety of gaming podcasts. When I have collected enough of them (close to 700MB), I burn the episoded on a mp3 cd, and then listen to them while commuting in my car. This puts a time gap between the moment new episodes are released and when I listen to them. So, I still have to listen to the twelve episodes of Christmas, and to the following ones.<br/><br/>But, in general, I much prefer news and reviews over personal musings. Your personal preferences, opinions and thoughts (which I appreciate) show anyway, plus I'm informed on new games and can decide if a game interests me enough to purchase it. The thing I always liked of HG,WT is that it covers (covered?) roleplaying games, boardgames and even light wargames, pretty much the full spectrum of my gaming. That, and the fact the sound quality is very high compared to the average gaming podcast (to a non-english listener, sound quality really makes a difference).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

You have a gift for reviews. I can hear your enthusiasm, and love for games in your reviews. I can tie some of your shows, where you were reviewing something, and tie them in to what I was doing at the time. Artesia I was walking in a mix of rain and snow to go to my friend Dan's house, the snow wasn't sticking to the cement... to play a roleplaying game I don't remember. That's burned into my head.<br/><br/>In the talking about ideas thing... you are on par with other people. This may be due to my being steeped in theory, or it maybe generally true, but nothing burns in my head. I'm still listening, but it seems you're ignoring your gift... like, after hearing all the folks you inspired, who came after, and chose to give advice, or talk theory, or to just yammer, caused you to question what you were doing. I'm still listening, but I can't tell you how happy I was to hear your mini-reviews during your 14 days of Christmas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188032/#Comment_188032" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T07:35:17+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  7:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Have Games, Will Travel</i> is still my favorite podcast.

At least any of the constructive interesting kind. I do have to say that I really liked your old format. I'm not sure how I feel about the "For a Few Games More" format yet but I certainly don't hate it. I've only listened to your Twelve Days of Have Games Will Travel for a Few Games More-mas... I think I prefer Paulmas.<br/><br/> I am a particular fan of your reviews and found them to be very informative and well put together. I'm not much of a theory person but I do find your episodes where you mull games and how you approach them interesting and will continue to listen to those. Honestly, I find something good in all your podcasts. You're very professional with a good speaking voice and sound quality. Too many of other podcasts out there are too much 3 guys bullshitting around a mike or the sound quality sucks. In the spirit, I am prone to skipping over podcasts where you have guests or are at gaming cons. Yours is the only gaming podcast I can bring myself to listen to besides the now defunct Gamer: The Podcasting which scratched a delicious LARP itch for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188140/#Comment_188140" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T14:58:09+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  2:58PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Abrahm</cite>In that spirit, I am prone to skipping over podcasts where you have guests or are at gaming cons.</blockquote>\nThis sort of thing is what I love about HGWT. Game reviews are great, especially if I'm interested in the game, but what consistently hits my buttons is discussing your more high-level thoughts on games and theory. I suppose that's just because it's always interesting, whereas talking about boardgame X may not be my cup of tea this week (although I appreciate being introduced to new things.

I enjoyed this part of the show.  Other than that I think you do a great job.  Your opinions are valuable in that they make me think about aspects of games and gaming that I might not otherwise notice.  I appreciate that you don't hold back on any game when you analyze or review it.  Regarding game design, I think you bring a view to both board games and role playing games that we don't hear.  Namely that you have feet in both camps.  Usually podcasters talk about one or the other.   Or don't bring the experience of both to the microphone.  While you don't do this explicitly in each show, I know that you love and play both styles of games.  That is valuable to me and I think is unique.<br/>\nThanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188442/#Comment_188442" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T05:59:09+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  5:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a serious note, my preferences don't matter that much.

I can honestly say it's turned me on to a lot of great games including Gloom, Ticket to Ride, Last Night on Earth, and PTA which I have gone on to buy. I like both formats although I too do miss the in-depth reviews. Of all the material, I think the discussions on roleplay theory are probably the least entertaining: While some of them can be interesting, often it's kind of dry &amp; abstract and can be hard to follow, especially if it's not really within the context of an AP example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188702/#Comment_188702" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T14:24:39+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  2:24PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like both formats.<br/><br/>I like the original theme song better.<br/><br/>I like the shows about specific games better than the shows about some aspect of gaming.<br/><br/>I like hearing about your personal gaming experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188864/#Comment_188864" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T00:25:43+00:00" title="January 18, 2009 12:25AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2009 12:29AM by Hans_c-o.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Well how would I know if you won't even link to it in your original post?
