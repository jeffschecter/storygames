Most have grown accustomed to this format, where the GM provides the players with the "interpretation" of their die rolls, data searches, NPC interactions, sword strikes, and so on. Some new game share this authority with other players. <b>I'm not arguing for OR against either format</b>. I'm merely observing that this is how players have grown used to the paradigm of PC = protagonist, GM = interpreter. There are other roles at work in game play. But I'm not speaking to those. Just this phenomenon.<br/><br/>I really think James' spoon analogy works pretty well, but doesn't speak DIRECTLY to the idea that it's the player's point of view that drives this paradigm and "spoon-feeding" can be taken as antagonistic. <br/><br/>As an analogy, I put a quarter into a video game and I am expected to hit the START button. A video game may NOT do this and just go straight to game-play, but neither has a term. I put in a quarter, I expect the video game to challenge/entertain. I have expectations as a player. The first time I did this I didn't know what to expect. Now, after 20+ years of video games, I know what happens when I hit start. A video game that expected me to leave the house and ask my neighbor for directions to the pentagon would break the expectation-paradigm.<br/><br/>An another analogy, I play in a WoD LARP twice a month. The storytellers have good stories, but extremely poor planning and administrative skills. They continue to invent a gaggle of different events each session that occur in the background of the environment, so that the players CANNOT interact with these elements of the story without them. If they ignore them and push forward with their agendas, the events become trivial. If the players investigate these events, they must wait in a <i>queue</i> for the GM to tell them how well they do at their interaction with these events. (I head up into the mountains to investigate, I meet the crazy one-eyed god in the parking lot, I fly my helicopter into city hall). Since there are 30 players and four storytellers, people are always waiting for a "turn."<br/><br/>Intentional or not (and I presume not), this stops play, hinders fun, and generally takes authority out of people's hand who might otherwise be comfortable with said authority. [Recognizing of course, that if the GM puts something behind the rock he's the only one who knows what's behind it, but making me wait in a queue to find out how much blood I get from feeding is pedantic and just a continuation of this philosophy that the GM is "momma bird."]. If this was the first roleplaying game these 30 people had ever played, they would be "trained" to believe that this is the only method of roleplaying. ACTOR inspires ACTION. VOICE OF AUTHORITY interprets said ACTION. RINSE. REPEAT.<br/><br/>To sum up, it's not a matter of "belief" in contrast to rules. It's a matter of "trained behavior" that the GM provides this function. But, again, it's similar to a baby-bird mentality to sit and wait for the GM to say, "good job jim. you found the sword. yeah!!!" I'm not judging it, I'm trying to come up with a clinical signifier to describe it, like the "hamster pellet feeder syndrome," but more scholastic.

Okay, I think I see where you're coming from.<br/><br/>And now I'm thinking that you, specifically, do not need a term to describe the traditional GM-authority approach to gaming; you know there are games that support that approach, you know there are plenty of terms to describe its elements and variations (Actor Stance and whatnot), and you know that there are lots of people who are familiar with it already.  What you <i>really</i> need are terms that describe the kind of shared-authority games you like, so that you can talk about THOSE games and what you like about them.  Fuck talking about what you don't enjoy, why are you even wasting your valuable time discussing a style of gaming that you have no interest in participating in?  Talk about how to best present, teach, and play the shared-authority games you love and just ignore all of those other games, and you'll no doubt get better results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318511/#Comment_318511" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T22:42:35+00:00" title="April  2, 2011 10:42PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just looking for a term to describe this phenomenon.

The book preached about how the game was going to be different, because it was going to be supported and enhanced by players wanting to contribute.

No other gaming format, places a centralized authoritative voice in the hands of one person, and on other gaming format has trained players to be used to that. We just accept that that's the only way the predecessor games could have ever been done. In actuality, it was foreign before 1973. Although H.G. Wells' Little Wars was a detraction from earlier wargame attempts to have a REFEREE at the table with a centralized authoritative voice as it pertained to rule interpretations, but he didn't decide the other <i>laws</i> of the game.<br/><br/>What this thread has taught me is there should be a term for this. It's a presumed <i>value</i> of roleplaying games to give one person "final say", but when you approach RPGs for the first time is very foreign. "Why does this guy have absolute authority?" And now that it exists has become a roadblock to design and development, instead of an affectation. And I think people who are going to GM-less games (myself included) still aren't asking the right questions. We're merely saying. Oh yeah. That's bad. Or that's not for me. Or that's not for me. Let's move on. Instead of... how did we get to this "centralized GM authority?" and why is it that players are so co-dependent up on it. And I think it's the co-dependency that really needs examination [albeit, I'm probably alone on that]. Co-dependency is a bad word there, but until we get a better term, that's what I'm using.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Something to think about, If you play monopoly and one guys is the banker, he still gets to play along side everyone else in the game way.

A video game is a long continuous string of telling the (programmed) GM what you do and it giving you feedback in response. Over and over and over. Sometimes you have to think, work out a puzzle, get a little fancy with the controls, whatever. Same with tabletop rpgs.<br/><br/>I like, and desire, proactive players when I run a game. But only in the most heinous instances of someone not engaging with play would I think that I was having to spoon-feed them. As long as they can tell me what their character is doing, and it doesn't constantly involve doing what accounts to nothing, then they're engaging with play. There might be misunderstandings about the type of play or method of play going on, but that's another issue.<br/><br/>Jim, is this just an issue you've seen in games with a distinct GM role? Cause I've seen players not engage across all kinds of play and games. So far I really think it has less to do with any particular sort of game or gaming tradition and a lot more to do with just culture at large. As well as various games attracting participation due to social reasons and not for playing a game reasons.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to grill you, but it feels like you're trying to catch a fish and I want to help you catch that fish, but you're pointing at a big barrel full of fish and saying "that's the one, right there".

You're half-way there. Players have grown dependent upon this format. Certainly there's a term for someone who can only talk about their feelings with a counselor or in group, right?

Co-dependency is a bad word there, but until we get a better term, that's what I'm using.</blockquote>\nDo you really want to know why? I mean, I'm pretty sure I know the answer to that actually.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games didn't originally have a single team of players working together against GM challenges. That was something that developed very early on, but it wasn't part of the very early thought-soup coming out of the wargaming tradition that later became, in off-shoot form, roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Early (and current) proto-RPG wargames are multifactional. There's a person who referees the game, and very likely also creates the game/scenario. That person needs to be impartial, but only regarding who wins. There's no need to be impartial in interpretting events or making rulings, however. The fact that players are largely reduced from being  in the role of a big army to that of playing a single character already encourages rather creative thinking on the part of players. After all, that single character is way more mortal that a unit of fellows, right?<br/><br/>Then there's he campaign aspect. In simple terms, you can pick up from the previous scenario's events and continue play, right? And those previous events and results impact future results, right? Someone needs to track that.<br/><br/>On top of all of that, frankly only creating the scenario and then refereeing it is, well, kinda boring. It isn't much of a jump to see how and why a ref might want to geta little play in themselves, by way of random encounters or interacting as an ad-hoc character when one of those clever players decides to wheedle/cajole/threaten to gain some sort of advantage without fighting. <br/><br/>Of course, one of the ways that undoubtedly some smart monkey figured out really early on to succeed ( or at least have their character survive) was to make their character more interesting to their fellow players and the referee.<br/><br/>And so there's all of that soup.<br/><br/>Now throw in the fact that said campaign may well involve, I dunno, a couple of dozen people meeting up in different combinations several nights a week to engage in these little "side-quest" type activities that may well give them some sort of advantage in the on-going wargame campaign. All those other atributes of the activity are now intensified. And, in those little side-quests, it starts to make more sense for the few people showing up that evening to act as a team, even if only temporarily.<br/><br/><br/>That of course is assuming something like a college game club with a bunch of folks to do just that, with a two dozen or so people pool to work with.<br/><br/>Now take that activity, write it down, and hand it off to a bunch of kids without that background and much smaller pools to draw from. Like 4-12 pals.<br/><br/>I mean, that's really the evolution in a nutshell. And the thing about the GM authority? Well, the GM has to have a reason to keep running this thing, right? They have to have a place to be as creative as the character players. So there just plain develops these parallel games being played by both character players and GM players which encourages both types to keep coming back and playing again, which is essentially the main goal of the whole thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318640/#Comment_318640" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T03:47:18+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  3:47AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell you what.<br/><br/>Let's pathologise the other style of gaming.

I come in with my character sheet and throw dice when you tell me to, and you tell me what happens. Clean, simple. You don't have to know the rules of the game! You just need to understand relative values of things on your sheet: 16STR is good, 7WIS is bad, I probably need to avoid situations where my Wisdom will be challenged. :-)<br/><br/>* For the right GM + player group, it's incredibly freeing. If I'm not going to be held to an objective result, I'm now free to present the "best" result, "best" being defined by my experience and judgement. If I'm keenly tuned in to my players, I feel like I have an inside track on what they're expecting and how to generate maximum awesomeness. Illusionism, whatever, if the players are, as you say, black box dependent, it's all good. My little brother is very much in this vein! He fucking *hates* any RPG with even the hint of democratization. <br/><br/>* It's a very practical solution to the real-world problem of player elimination through character loss or irrelevancy. So even if you're a crap GM who doesn't really know what his players want, at the very least you can ensure that players continue to have play time.<br/><br/>I would say that in the trad world, this style of play is by no means the be-all-end-all. There are puh-LENTY of tactically minded D&amp;D players out there who really need full information about their options and likely outcomes in order to have a fun time with it.

If there's a GM-less RPG in there that I missed, I'm really sorry.<br/><br/>But, this thread wasn't about that discussion though. I'm really just looking for a word/phrase to express the concept of "Black Box Dependency." I'm working on something (yes that's purposely vague) that specifically addresses this phenomenon in a scholastic manner. I was curious if the story-game crowd had developed a term for this in addition to the other language that has arrived in the last decade around the RPG medium. Since clearly everyone has attempted to give me language to describe the player-GM relationship, but not the dependency of this relationship, it is clear that it's not well-discussed.

"Dependency" is tough one to get my head around; the folks I know who absolutely require this sort of play -- are they <i>dependent</i>? Or just very settled in their preferences? I dunno! <br/><br/>"Dependency" in my head implies a failing or shortcoming -- I depend on eating every day because I will die if I don't get calories, right? So like "black box dependency" would imply, at least to me, that a player was simply unable to engage with the act of roleplaying without a facilitator handling all resolution behind the scenes. Do those players exist? Maybe. Haven't seen it. <br/><br/>Now if you're talking about some kind of, I don't know, dysfunctional relationship between GMs Who Must Control and Players Who Must Be Controlled, I guess we'd be in "black box codependency" territory. That's some strong jet fuel there, strong enough for a flame war without end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318777/#Comment_318777" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T19:42:42+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  7:42PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>There's certainly no question as to why it was a successful medium for roleplaying for so long, but rather, why it was the ONLY medium for so long.<br/><br/>When you look at it from a non-indie publisher standpoint, the model stopped working a long time ago, but no one knew how to correct the change in the environment. And, I feel, a lot of it can be traced back to this very question. Or a lack of asking this question.<br/><br/>"Do we still need a black box? Can we play games without them?"</blockquote>\nSeems to me that the basic premise here is pretty flawed. Even the old school games were played using a bunch of varied techniques (including various levels of input and authority distribution). Probably because the games themselves didn't really give you a whole lot to work with in terms of how the games were run or played. So people adjusted towards what they found to be fun and functional. That or they left the hobby. I don't know how dominant or extreme these variations were, but I know they existed.<br/><br/>As for the model no longer working... I have to ask "for who?". It still works quite well for a lot of people. Does this assumption stem from publishers no longer making bank with supplement treadmills? The ups and downs of the rpg industry has to do with a lot of issues and circumstances.<br/><br/>As for your last questions, I don't think the hobby as a whole ever needed a black box, it just so happens that a lot of people enjoy that style of play and the first rpgs were built around having a strong referee role. There are games out there that make it pretty obvious that we can for sure play games without the black box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318780/#Comment_318780" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T21:05:05+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  9:05PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim,<br/><br/>Why not just describe the phenomena, whenever you want to have a conversation about it?

Especially if you want to relate the term to larp play (which your specific complaint was about). Blackbox larp is already a specific term in use. It is used by a large group of primarily Canadian players to describe a form they use that is similar to improvizational theatre. They purposely use blank sets, possibly with plain boxes when necessary for things like chairs and tables. They create a space and give it a time and place and create scenes in that space. People who are not in a space at the moment are out of play and can observe other scenes as an audience. It's a funky form of larp with a lot of improv theatre influence.<br/><br/>I haven't heard anything big and new about it recently, but there are some neat threads on it at rpg.net in the larp forum. I think they're about 2, maybe 3 years old.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Based on the actual rant post - <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2314&amp;Mode=like">#14</a>, about the WoD LARP, I don't think you need a term regarding tabletop play. I think what you need is a term for trying to shoehorn tabletop-style play into larp.<br/><br/>In tabletop play, you expect to have a lot of interaction with the GM. You expect them to come up with stuff for you to interact with it. You expect them to interpret for you how that interaction went.<br/><br/>Larp design doesn't work well in that mode. Larp works best when the players are interacting primarily with each other and the GM doesn't need to be there to facilitate.<br/><br/>I wrote more about it here: <a href="http://www.mortalisrpg.com/forum/index.php?action=downloads;sa=view;down=6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mortalisrpg.com/forum/index.php?action=downloads;sa=view;down=6</a><br/>The article is called LARP is Simultaneous Action. My premise is that the thing that larp does best, better than any other medium, is to give the players the sense that multiple significant things are going on at the same time. Better larp design generally takes strong advantage of this element of the medium. Your GMs aren't doing so.<br/><br/>So I'll throw out a term for you. Shoehorning. Trying to run a larp like a tabletop. It is often the source of poor larp design and less fun had by the players.<br/><br/>Primary indicators of shoehorning:<br/>The GMs say something is interesting. But you have to talk to one to find out more about it, rather than having a non-GM NPC with plenty of information and decision-making power available to talk to players about it.<br/>GMs who play major NPCs themselves while trying to do heavy system adjudication at the same time.<br/>GMs who structure information so that they have to trickle it out themselves during the event, rather than giving interesting bits to various players, along with giving them reasons for sharing those bits.<br/><br/>A lot of that is restating the same things in different ways, but there are multiple, related parts to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>what's the thing called (not the uvula)..... ? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="what's the thing called (not the uvula)..... ? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I do not feel this is a good or bad thing.

But I do find it a fascinating phenomenon. Fascinating enough that I need a term for it... for a project I am working on. So for those who keep asking WHY I'm doing it, I'm purposely being vague about why. My intention was not to begin a debate about it's relative value (although I did make the mistake of saying I don't prefer this game style, which lead someone to believe I was trolling). But the fact of the matter is, I don't like simulationism either, but I still have to sit down and design and develop TALISMAN-derivative games... which are just dreadful. Or games like Thunderstone, which are hardly games at all, but exercises in shuffling skills.<br/><br/>And I agree that Black Box isn't perfect, because it describes the process of play and not the phenomenon that Jenskot described... "players waiting for be fed a story." And because that has negative connotations as a result of the phraseology, a term that describes this phenomenon in a neutral, scholarly manner is more appropriate. As I said in an earlier post, stimulus-response-interactivity-dependence is really what I'm describing here, but it's such a convoluted term that it's useless.<br/><br/>I can appreciate that hobbyists have no interest in such methodology. I get that. And as I said earlier, it is likely that 99% of you will never use this term. I am developing this language for my needs and if it becomes habit forming, great. But, that's not my mission-statement.<br/><br/>[If it "reaches just one kid" it was all worth it.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318872/#Comment_318872" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-05T11:28:58+00:00" title="April  5, 2011 11:28AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob.

The same go for GMs moving between play styles and mediums (table-top, larp, freeform, etc.). Wow.

Here's how I've experienced it:<br/><br/>There are a great variety of ways to play roleplaying games, different distributions of authority, different techniques, etc. But there has been, for a long time, a school of thought that was very dominant, and that describes a very specific kind of distribution of authority and style of play. Have you all never seen this? People who play as follows:<br/><br/>* The GM provides all descriptions, players never do. Players have to ask, "What does it look like?", or even, "Is there a bottle on the shelf behind the bar?" They ask for permission before providing any description or doing anything other than stating in-character actions.<br/><br/>* Similarly, players never introduce any game-world facts without asking the GM for permission to do so first.<br/><br/>This is a certain play-style that, while functional and fun, is seen by many gamers as the Only Way to Play. Players new to RPGs, in particular, are often subjected to angry glares or worse if they tread on these "rules".<br/><br/>Consider that, when the Forge was starting up, people laughed at the idea that a player could describe the way their attacks harmed an enemy, or made up any features of the setting: "Give any control to the players, and the game will be destroyed!" This was (and still is for many) a very common fear among RPG gamers.<br/><br/>Playing in a group of people that glares at you anytime you tread on these boundaries creates a certain pattern of behaviour.<br/><br/>I've seen people who have intense difficulties playing another type of game if this is the only kind of gaming they've been exposed to. In particular, I remember a game of In a Wicked Age... which would not go anywhere because every time a player narrated something into play (as you must in that game, when you make Challenges and Answers), they would trip over their own feet trying desperately NOT to narrate anything that would actually influence play in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>In this style of play, players learn to add details to play, but only when those details do not impact anything meaningful (anything that could change the flow of the plot, for example).<br/><br/>I've seen a number of game texts that include rules such as the following, to support this style of play:<br/><br/>* A player may spend a Kool Point at any time to narrate some prop or detail into existence. However, any such player narration that might affect the outcome of the scene or derail the plot can and should be vetoed by the GM.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure where to go with this, but to say it's not a thing at all... that doesn't jive with my experiences. Just wanted to add in my two cents here. I hope I'm on topic.<br/><br/>Looking forward to hearing more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318893/#Comment_318893" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-05T12:54:05+00:00" title="April  5, 2011 12:54PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2011 12:55PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>Rob. No. I'm familiar with shoehorning. I made a thread post earlier about how Medium informs design.

The same go for GMs moving between play styles and mediums (table-top, larp, freeform, etc.). Wow. Way off topic.</blockquote>Not so much. It was a response to the most detailed example you've given so far. I just want to be clear that shoehorning tabletop design into larp design is not the same thing as what you are talking about, even though the symptoms are similar because they involve awkward interactions with a GM.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm probably a good example of the passive play you're talking about. When we were playing tabletop at your place many years ago. My play was not active and aggressive enough. It was my first time playing with such a small group, and I was having a hard time developing my own agendas and such.<br/><br/>Part of it was that I was playing reactively instead of proactively. That's at least one angle of what you are trying to get at.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>I didn't know that canadian larpers had placed such huge demands on the nomenclature of gaming.

Blackbox is already being otherwise used to mean something very different.

There a literally hundreds of games I could pick from to describe this "dependency."</blockquote>\nI think "reactive play" is a little less perjorative than "passive play".<br/><br/>Sometimes I want to play within a more structured environment. I want someone else to make the playset and make something that's likely to be fun to interact with. I want them to come up with people for me to talk to and puzzles for me to solve and things for me to strategize against and maybe kill.<br/><br/>Other times I want to build castles in the sand. Heck, I want to decide what color the sand is and what it's silicone content is and other granular stuff (see what I did there?). I want to let my imagination run wild and be proactive and create characters and conflicts and stories from whole cloth.<br/><br/>Sometimes I want a little something in between.

It allows for the existance of folks like the Old School Renaissance crowd, who know that other play styles have been developed and either consciously refuse to engage in them because they don't sound fun, or have tried them and discarded them.<br/><br/>So if you want a phrase that assumes a lack of knowledge of other styles of play, then you may want to call it "ignorance-based trad-style play". It's a bit long, but it clearly states what it means, if that's the particular phenomenon you need a term for.<br/><br/>Coining a new term for "ignorance-based trad-style play" would probably just add confusion and force you to gloss the term anyway.<br/><br/>But if you wanted to call it hobo play, that would be cool. Cause hobos are awesome. Especially since it fits in nicely with the "band of murderous hobos" style of adventure structure that is often mentioned at rpg.net and is a common part of many trad style games. Not to mention the connection with railroading - hobos aren't hobos anymore when they get too far from the railroad - they're drifters. Makes for a nice extended metaphor.

To me, it also reads exactly the same way as "How has chocolate ice cream thrived this long?" I'm probably reading you wrong and perhaps that's why the topic seems to be spinning wheels at times.<br/><br/>My guess is that the term most of the folks use to describe what your talking about is "roleplaying game". Again, I'm probably reading you wrong but you seem to be describing the way most folks play RPGs. Certainly not the folks at this site of course but walk into most gaming shops or conventions, select a random table to listen to I think youll see what you're describing. Right?<br/><br/>And furthermore, I have to assume that the reason it has thrived is because thats what most folks want. The innovations that I've discovered in various indie games are fascinating and exciting but for the most part they don't do what those folks want. So the main branch, or the trunk I suppose, continues to thrive.<br/><br/>Have I completely missed you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li

With that as context I'll go on to say that the hobo tag would be considered inaccurate by my group. We've always considered a railroad game one in which the plot proceeds in a canned fashion regardless of your actions. We never liked that very much. The players want freedom to act as they wish (explore), but they want the GM to provide the feedback on that exploration.<br/><br/>Anyway, that didn't add much but I did want to say that my players would probably disagree with the Hobo tag.

Dependency may seem like a strong choice of words but it may be pretty accurate. In the same way that I have a dependency upon Phillips head screwdrivers when I want to twist a Phillips head screw.<br/><br/>When my players want to "explore" there has to be a source of feedback for their actions. They can't provide that feedback themselves (via shared narration or whatever else) and still get discovery. That's why I think a lot of people "depend" on that model of play.

They just know their OD&amp;D, and they have played in the same world for 20+ years. They rarely play, but when they do, they are absolutely living their characters and imagining that they are in the world. We all are. It's exciting, we care what happens, and they simply aren't aware that their are other systems and are mainly not interested in how and why the game plays as it does. In this game, I am a black box GM. Of course it's an illusion, like a film or especially a play is an illusion. So, by immersion, in this specific game mean you can almost see and taste the shared world, you care about your characters and cooperate to have fun in a non-meta-game way. It's visceral It's a pop-corn-munching roller coaster ride rather than a private viewing of abstract photography.<br/><br/>I'm not claiming that any particular system brings you that experience, it's probably just historical circumstance, and a ridiculously long campaign stretching from those formative years when we had the time and drive to get so deeply involved. It's certainly not the only kind of enjoyment I get out of roleplaying.

At least, I'm pretty sure I've seen "trad gaming" with very high "spoon feeding" as well as "trad gaming" with very little "spoon feeding".<br/><br/>You can have passive players, active players, etc, in all different types. In particular, many OSR games rely very heavily on player authorship, just through different channels than "GMless story games".<br/><br/>So those things are not necessarily linked: you can have very proactive players in an OSR game or passive boring players playing PTA. Sure, definitely.<br/><br/>So,<i>is</i>there a "syndrome" or a "problem"? Well, yes, sure. We can't conclude there isn't one just because all these different things work. What is it? Where is it?<br/><br/>It's when someone WANTS TO play a game with high player authorship, and TRIES to do so. But ingrained habits keep them from enjoying themselves; they can't bring themselves to do it.<br/><br/>That's a problem, then, at that point. How common is this? I don't know. But I've seen it at least a couple of times. It's not hard to create a pattern of behaviour, especially if there's a whole group of your friends (or strangers!) glaring at you when you "do it wrong". After that happens a few times, you'll be afraid to do it again, you'll probably even be afraid if someone else tries to do it, and do your best to stop them. ("No! Not that. You're doing it wrong!")<br/><br/>So, you try to play a game that says, "Hey, something cool happens now. What is it?" ...and you can't, it's painful. Not that you do it and you find you don't like: rather that you WANT to do it, and you just can't override those negative experience.<br/><br/>That seems like a good analogy for dependency/addiction, if you want to go that way: "addiction" is often defined as "when it begins to interfere with whatever else you're trying to do" (like, say, your work). Not that I recommend this kind of terminology, though: I probably wouldn't recommend using any more language that sounds this... dangerous.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is, "This is when it might be useful to realize it happens so you can fix it in your group (if that's your desire, of course)."<br/><br/>The solution, I think, is simply spreading the word, letting people know, everywhere, that, hey, there are lots of different ways to play, and why don't you try some different ones rather than assuming that the way you play is the only way?<br/><br/><br/>(Another time this sort of thing becomes a problem is when people new to roleplaying try to play a certain way, and are told by others that, no, you can't do that. You inventing stuff would ruin the game. And with the implication that this is true for all roleplaying, in any form.<br/><br/>Basically any time people think it's the Only True Way is when it's a problem, in my eyes. Otherwise, hey, carry on: do whatever you find fun, right? I like both games with tons of player authorship and games with Strong GM Authority: they can both be a heck of a good time.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14072%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14072%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>what's the thing called (not the uvula)..... ? - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="what's the thing called (not the uvula)..... ? - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Syndrome can also just be a metaphor for a condition that exists.

I actually used it once in quotes to illustrate that it's "like this," but not really. You can assume all you want that the one word was a pejorative decrying behavior. OR you can read the entire thread and see that to be not the case at all, that I'm curious about this phenomenon, because it relates to other things.<br/><br/>In all fairness, I just wanted to know if there was a word for it. That's it. Should I choose to post my theory about it's relevance, you can then tear that apart and tell me what a horrible person I am. But right now, the only sin I've committed is to post this on a forum that's riddled with guilt about the so-called gaming schism.<br/><br/>This thread is about 80 posts too long with me re-iterating that point.<br/><br/>And I appreciate Paul's post. But I'm not trying to fix or change anything. I'm trying to identify a term because I have a very selfish need to define things like this. And if it's my dysfunction to have a box full of definitions because definitions make me feel good, then let me have my box. All these attacks have done is make me less likely to explain what I needed the damn term for in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319146/#Comment_319146" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T13:05:45+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  1:05PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            on a side note, i want to thank the people who contributed, wrote to me privately, and saw the value of this examination without any implied hate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319159/#Comment_319159" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T14:00:54+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  2:00PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recommend Susan Sontag's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness_as_Metaphor" rel="nofollow">Illness as a Metaphor</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319160/#Comment_319160" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T14:14:16+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  2:14PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2011 2:15PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for fun:<br/><br/>Jim, is this along the lines of what you're talking about, or something unrelated?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite>I wanted to bring in this point<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13332" rel="nofollow">from another thread</a>.<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: DanielZKlein</cite>There's a few things you need to explain that you wouldn't even think of--stuff like, "no, you should probably not describe what MY character looks like and does; you can throw out ideas, but I should control my character"</blockquote>\nThis is really common for people who have never played before. Once they've played a little, I let them know that character monogamy is sort of standard (so they don't get slammed by the weirdness of it when they play again with another crew) but I don't discourage their way.<br/><br/>There's something interesting going on with this - as a community we actively reject the most intuitive approach to the activity. Hmm.<br/>This is really common! I've gamed with many people new to RPGs and one of the first bumps is limiting narration. It's common for new players to describe beyond the scope of their character. It's completely understandable. Which Is another reason I've been surprised by so many long term gaming groups aggressively prohibiting even describing the results of your own character's actions.<br/>Over the past few years, I\u2019ve gamed with a few people new to roleplaying, and I\u2019ve seen this happen over and over.  New players get excited about narrating the actions of their characters and, every time they get to roll dice, tend to give these inspired, embellished accounts of what happens, only to have their contributions quashed by the person running the game.  Blowing the roll doesn\u2019t help\u2014this was discussed upthread\u2014but I\u2019ve seen game masters specify to a new player that it\u2019s not his or her place to describe the character\u2019s action as such.  Their responsibility is simply to announce an action and roll a die\u2014the GM is in charge of the rest.  The resulting loss of enthusiasm is tangible and unnecessary, given how needless the dichotomy the GM chooses to enforce is to the success of the game.<br/><br/>[Edit: from the great <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13314" rel="nofollow">Player rolls, GM describes...</a> thread.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319161/#Comment_319161" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T14:15:08+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  2:15PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim,<br/><br/>I don't think people are getting hot under the collar because you want to define a thing and give it a name. It's because you seem determined to pass up any name for the thing that isn't pejorative. Which is your prerogative, but obviously you're going to catch some flack for doing so. Todd's scale of "player authorship" seems pretty accurate to me.

But the "symptom" is the opposite. In this case, the player wants to play another way. In my observation, people are surprised to learn (or choose to ignore) that there is another way.<br/><br/>Imagine you are running Vampire  \u2014 can we agree it's a bridge game between simulationism and story-games? \u2014 and you have this player-centric model of play, some people call it a sandbox. And everyone else is off running around the city, doing stuff, and I am quietly waiting my turn. But there are no turns. Nothing. You try to engage me with things to do and I do them and then go back to "hibernating" at the table, waiting for my turn. I have come from a background of Voiced Authority gaming and my dependence on that model is ingrained in me, now. Even when you told me 20 times before the campaign started, I would have goals, agendas, and active things to do. I still sat there and waited for my turn.<br/><br/>That's learned behavior. That learned behavior can stem from school yard activities, which teach people to "share and take turns." But if we take it one step further and the results of my actions can only be interpreted by you in addition to waiting for the die to come around for my turn to "claw his face." We have an additional kink in the model of behavior.<br/><br/>That summation, whether you like that style of play or not, is systemic of a business model that never saw any other way of doing things. Which leads to TONS of conversations that would bore the piss out of most everyone here. But are certainly valuable for me in exploring how certain games could have been designed in the post Vampire age. Or in the post-Sorcerer age. Or whatever. It might tell me where MUDS came from, where FPS came from, and so on. I have no idea if any of that is exciting to anyone that isn't taking a class on the history of games, but it excites me. It makes me re-evaluate minor steps like a game called, Psychosis... which if you've never played, should have been the predecessor to this entire story-games movement. It was released in 1993 (i think) and completely shattered my world-view of what RPGs could be.<br/><br/>How designers missed this is anyone's guess. But design models like VAD might attribute.<br/><br/>Whispering Vault, another predecessor to the story-games movement, that less than 1% of people I talk to have ever heard of. And certainly few (industry) designers draw from for inspiration.<br/><br/>None of this is something I want to debate or discuss right now, however, because it's historical rhetoric and I'm not sure if the two are connected yet.

And everyone else is off running around the city, doing stuff, and I am quietly waiting my turn. But there are no turns. Nothing. You try to engage me with things to do and I do them and then go back to "hibernating" at the table, waiting for my turn. I have come from a background of Voiced Authority gaming and my dependence on that model is ingrained in me, now. Even when you told me 20 times before the campaign started, I would have goals, agendas, and active things to do. I still sat there and waited for my turn.</blockquote>\nThanks for the example. This is clear. Voiced Authority Dependency isn't the best description of what you're talking about here. For me, VAD doesn't mean anything inherently. When you used it in this paragraph, it felt poorly integrated (an indication that it's not the best possible term for the job). If pressed, I would guess that VAD meant "depending on a system to lend authority to things which have been spoken aloud rather than merely thought about or recorded on the page," which isn't what you want to use it for.<br/><br/>Better terms that don't sound like superfluous jargon might be: reactive gameplay, reactionary gameplay, passive gameplay, turn-based gameplay, turn-based thinking.<br/><br/>You can obviously take any one of those terms (like: reactive gameplay) and change the wording (to perhaps: reactive thinking, reactive play, reactive players, etc).<br/><br/>If you want different terms, there has been lots of talk about this sort of stuff already. Searching The Forge for discussions about RPG stances (actor stance, author stance, director stance) will connect you with existing conversations about who initiates what and how they do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319176/#Comment_319176" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T14:54:02+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  2:54PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Better terms that don't sound like superfluous jargon might be: reactive gameplay, reactionary gameplay, passive gameplay, turn-based gameplay, turn-based thinking.</blockquote>\nSo very close.

"I don't play in another style of game (for whatever reason)."<br/><br/>And you missed the next paragraph where I continue to explain that not only am I dependent upon the passive model, but I'm dependent upon the GM's interpretation of the passive model, where ever actions is interpreted for me.<br/><br/>For the record, this is why I've continued to pass over this "passive" suggestion, because it fails to address the entire gestalt of the concept I am alluding to.

Okay, whew.<br/><br/>A new thought, which may not be relevant:<br/><br/>The behavior of the players expecting the GM to interpret the results of any given resolution, right? So you've got description description description, fine, whatever, but there comes a moment where the description isn't set in stone yet. The moment gets fuzzy. There is uncertainty. I want something and you want something. We roll dice, say, and what the GM says is what clarifies that moment. Suddenly things pull into focus and we continue along with our descriptions and whatnot. <br/><br/>I think there are two things going on here. This may be retreading Forge territory but let's just pretend it's not.<br/><br/>First, someone has to decide that the moment has gotten fuzzy. Who is that? Is that the GM, always? Do players traditionally have the opportunity to identify those unresolved moments? IME at least, it's gone both ways. GMs identify unresolved moments I think mostly as a means of establishing pacing. An unresolved moment is a beat. It's tension awaiting release. <br/><br/>There are, I think, some play groups that treat literally <i>anything</i> addressed by the rules as "unresolved moments": if you've got rules for digging a ditch, we don't really know if that ditch got dug 'til someone goes to the ditch digging rules and carries out the procedure. <br/><br/>There are, I think, some play groups that are more discriminating in deciding what moments are best treated as unresolved. Someone feels that that tension is valuable or fun or whatever. That "someone" is typically the GM, right? But I'll bet individual players also advocate for that as well. Might come via social pressure ("come on, let's just roll it and see what happens") or smart tactical play ("my character has a lot of advantages in a social setting, so rather than just handwaving it I would really like to roll some dice here and see if I've got a shot") or, probably, some desire for genre/realism fidelity ("there's no script immunity for major characters in this sort of fiction we're playing toward, so we're going to let the dice fall where they may"). Whatever.<br/><br/>I guess this is a long way toward my actual point here, in which it's a question of where authority lies.<br/><br/>So when you're talking about "the dependency that prohibits participation because players expect the GM to interpret the results", I guess I'd suggest a reframe of this: some players prefer that the GM have final authority.<br/><br/>I don't love that "authority" gets so quickly conflated with "power", or that either/both those words come so freighted. In a perfect world you could call this "dictator play" and not have advocates up in arms with the word "dictator," because I do think that's awfully darned accurate. A benevolent dictatorship in almost all cases to be sure, but it's got a lot of baggage.<br/><br/>I've very lightly, weakly advocated a "lines of authority" theory of RPG play and design for a very long time now and I find it's a useful way to think about why some rules work well or poorly with some groups. I think this also gets to your OP, Jim, and I think I agree with it: Most traditional RPGs have, from the beginning, been designed around the implicit assumption that all authority rests with a dictator, <i>and that players like it that way.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319456/#Comment_319456" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T15:46:59+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  3:46PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I've very lightly, weakly advocated a "lines of authority" theory of RPG play and design for a very long time now and I find it's a useful way to think about why some rules work well or poorly with some groups.

Which leads to many other issues of relevancy in publishing and design.<br/><br/>I think it's time to start a thread about this, now that we have better language to work from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319459/#Comment_319459" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T16:30:05+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  4:30PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>I find that looking at things in terms of responsibility as well as, or instead of, authority can be enlightening. You can say that in conflict resolution by GM fiat, that the GM has full authority to determine outcomes - but more relevantly you can also say that the non-GM players have no <i>responsibility</i> to determine outcomes. <br/><br/>And when you consider that it is the bulk of the players (GM potentially included) that determine which social method for conflict resolution is in use, the difference between conflict resolution by GM-led consensus or even open consensus is as much a matter of non-GM players minimizing their responsibilities as it is them automatically ceding their potential authority.<br/><br/>Which can be especially frustrating for a GM, who may not want to saddled with so much responsibility.<br/><br/>In cases like that, you either have a fundamental disagreement or a failure to communicate your preferences. Considering how hard communication is, I'd strongly favor the later. <br/><br/>Jim, so armchair diagnosis I'd say you are dealing with a failure in communicating your desire to not have conflict resolution by GM fiat to the other players. Of course there is a small chance that 1) it is impossible for these players to comprehend or enact that change or 2) these players don't care enough about your enjoyment of the game to take on some responsibility. In either case, the solution is to find other players. But really, communication is most likely the real issue, which suggests remedies such as teaching by example and action, rather than high concept.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319477/#Comment_319477" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T19:17:48+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  7:17PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>Jim, so armchair diagnosis I'd say you are dealing with a failure in communicating your desire to not have conflict resolution by GM fiat to the other players.

Scotty often stands on stage berating the audience.  He says "Wake up! You're HERE now. You aren't home watching your TV!  We've got dancing girls Right Here In Front Of You, so put away your cameraphone."  Singling one guy out: "What's the matter, pal? Can't get an erection unless you're looking at a computer screen?!!"<br/><br/>Unlike mass media, Scotty breaks the rules of the-customer-is-always-right by saying 'no' to audience behaviors. Treating the audience as individuals also violates the assumed anonymity of mass entertainment.<br/><br/>It is very tempting to say that one-way-only media-- where the movie/tv/internet-porn is broadcast only from the provider to the recipients-- has conditioned the audience members into Reliant Entertainment Focus.<br/><br/>But then again, aren't the audience members stepping-up and deciding how they each want to experience the show?... when they choose whether to use a cameraphone?<br/><br/>Isn't Scotty shouting them down, using the bully pulpit of centerstage and microphone?     When he pulls audience members onstage-- to play some silly gameshow game, he wants them to stick to an (un)Voiced Authority Dependency: "What's your name? Where are you from? Is this your first time here?  OK-- here's what I want you to do..."    The audience isn't supposed to go off-script and take-over the show.<br/><br/>x<br/><br/>So.  Why do audience members behave passively?  Have they been conditioned by a lifetime of passive entertainment?<br/><br/>In the 1950's, US Congressional hearings blamed juvenile delinquency on comic books. <br/><br/>A few years ago, Ron Edwards accused the game Vampire of causing literal brain damage.<br/><br/>In this discussion, Jim has made a very similar case.   Saying that certain game designs and play modes condition players into certain undesirable expectations and behaviors.<br/><br/>But are the games really to blame?  I see other plausible explanations.  I think it might be ingrained deeply into human culture, maybe even hardwired into human nature.   Two examples:<br/><br/>An new playground was unveiled in NYC a few years ago. An expensive architect was hired.  Some citizens protested, saying "Who needs an architect?! Why don't you just Ask The Kids What They Want?"   The designers responded: because kids just say they want a slide, swings, and a sandbox.  It turns out-- that little kids are poor playground designers.  They just parrot what they've seen before.<br/><br/>Is this the fault of existing playgrounds?  Have the kids been conditioned by a Matrix of cookie-cutter playgrounds?   Or is it a result of their level of development: that's just how kids think.<br/><br/>It's not just kids.  Vietnam War veterans were in an uproar when (asian, woman, non-veteran, designer) Maya Lin's war memorial was announced.   Had vets been 'conditioned' by previous statues and D.C. landmarks?     <br/><br/>And now-- 'list of names on a wall' designs have become a cliche-- but is that because Maya Lin conditioned anyone?<br/><br/>x<br/><br/>Psychiatrist Murray Bowen would assert that the game-table behaviors Jim notes are rooted in one's personal history and the state of one's relationship with parents:<br/><br/><i>"Differentiation of self refers to one's ability to separate one's own intellectual and emotional functioning from that of the family. Bowen spoke of people functioning on a single continuum or scale. Individuals with "low differentiation" are more likely to become fused with predominant family emotions. (A related concept is that of an undifferentiated ego mass, which is a term used to describe a family unit whose members possess low differentiation and therefore are emotionally fused.) Those with "low differentiation" depend on others' approval and acceptance. They either conform themselves to others in order to please them, or they attempt to force others to conform to themselves. They are thus more vulnerable to stress and they struggle more to adjust to life changes.<br/>To have a well-differentiated "self" is an ideal that no one realizes perfectly. They recognize that they need others, but they depend less on other's acceptance and approval. They do not merely adopt the attitude of those around them but acquire their principles thoughtfully. These help them decide important family and social issues, and resist the feelings of the moment. Thus, despite conflict, criticism, and rejection they can stay calm and clear headed enough to distinguish thinking rooted in a careful assessment of the facts from thinking clouded by emotion. What they decide and say matches what they do. When they act in the best interests of the group, they choose thoughtfully, not because they are caving in to relationship pressures. Confident in their own thinking, they can either support another's view without becoming wishy-washy or reject another's view without becoming hostile."</i><br/><br/>I find it very plausible that such forces are far more influential at the game table, than whether a player has played too many GM-authority-driven games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14072/whats-the-thing-called-not-the-uvula/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14072%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14072%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
