I'm looking for your inspiration and ideas.  <br/>Short, sweat and simple but COOL ideas.<br/><br/>Here's my one "need" ... my PCs are all playing the monsterous races in D&amp;D fantasy... a "reverse dungeon" type setting.  We have a: <br/>-  Goblin Paladin/Thief<br/>-  Gnoll Ranger<br/>-  Hobgoblin Wizard<br/>-  Bugbear Cleric<br/>-  Minotaur Warlock<br/><br/>I'm NOT looking for stat blocks or D&amp;D specific ideas.  Just cool medieval fantasy encounters.<br/>The group plans to go "out into the country" ... OUT of the dungeons, so it'd be great to have ideas on how/what they'd encounter for little outposts, towns, villages, farms, and other normal human type locations, stuff with farmers, homesteaders and such  (think of how adventurers go into dungeons, the HOMES of these monster... I want to do that in reverse!).  But I also want to make them challenging and fun.  <br/>For Example:<br/>The PCs stumble onto the small shack of Grizzly Adams - who happens to have a big bear pet!!  etc...<br/><br/>I'm also looking for other neat wilderness and other encounters.<br/><br/><br/>Any help?<br/><br/>thanks<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152948/#Comment_152948" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T12:18:37+00:00" title="June 25, 2008 12:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The PC's find a small caravan of clerics, nuns and peasants making a pilgrimage to a nearby holy shrine/place/McGuffin.<br/><br/>The group stumbles into a mid-summer solstice festival of the local elves.<br/><br/>They find another band of humanoids who are planning a raid on a small village.

After all, most monsters that are more or less stuck in this plane as second class citizens, living on the outskirts of society, only gaining employment when a wizard stops by wanting to populate his dungeon or a warlord wants to sack a city.  It's very much like being an illegal immigrant trying to make it as a day laborer.  It's really tough.  But it's nice to be able to send treasure back home to support your family struggling under the oppression of some demon lord or another, right?  Or just to head home every once in a while to see how everyone's doing.  And, to do that, somebody has to keep this portal open.<br/><br/>However, recently, the passage home has come under repeated attacks from wandering mercenary bands of mortals.  So you're being called back because, if the Keep falls, how the hell are you gonna get back to the Shadowfell for the holidays?  Irontooth says they seem to be coming up from Winterhaven, so you're gonna start with hiding by the side of the road and jumping anyone who gets close.  Maybe, after a few encounters, you'll try storming the town itself, going alley by alley and putting a stop to this nonsense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155302/#Comment_155302" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T21:38:31+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  9:38PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The party climbs out of the underworld somewhere near (or in) a town that has just seen a terrible crime committed.

Or will they try to confront the humans and see if they will listen to reason; try to expose the real criminals?<br/><br/>Possible twist: The PCs have somehow lost the entrance to the underworld that they climbed out of. They need to get back there... to safety. But only the humans in the village know where it is.
