It'll be a monthly type thing, when my fiance's in town, and he's just getting back on the GMing horse after a couple years hiatus, and this will be his first stab at the kind of game where the players have a lot of narrative control.  It's a tough row to how for him in that sense, because he's definitely from the GM-Meta-Plot school of gaming, and likes what he's been seeing out of the indie-games I've been running (PTA, Dogs, HQ, etc), but still getting his head around it.  I applaud his bravery in taking this particular game on, and I'm also trying to help him out as much as possible in the PTA game I'm in turn running for him and his wife and a friend, which I'm doing at least in part to explore the "new stuff" in PTA in an environment in which he is not in the GM-hot-seat.<br/><br/>So. Right. Here's what we're doing.  This stuff all 'matters' to the question I ask below:\n<blockquote>The BBC presents: "Ill Met By Gaslight" -- Intrigue and Mystery in a Fae-awakened Victorian England<br/><br/>PREMISE: "Department M", ostensibly of the Special Branch deals with problems arising from the arrival of the Fae in Victorian England.<br/>TONE: Serious, dark-edged, but not brutal or nihilistic. Some horror elements. Designed for broadcast after the 9pm watershed. </blockquote>\nAnd my guy in this show is:\n<blockquote><br/>Quince Dunboyne, Ex-Scotland Yard inspector who lost his wife and his way.<br/><br/>Issue: <i>Hates/distrusts all Fae.</i> Spiraling downward after the suicide of his wife, Dunboyne became convinced there was evidence in the Whitechapel murders that pointed to Fae involvement. He pressed the matter too hard, despite warnings of the political volatility, leading to his dismissal in disgrace.<br/><br/>Screen Presence (2) - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 3 (Slow start, until breaking out as a key issue in the series finale.)<br/><br/>Personal Set: Opium use (still not happy with this)<br/><br/>Nemesis: Plumfarthing - One of the few Fae in the world with no known title, Plumfarthing's role appears that of an enforcer for the Fae nobility. He was involved in the Dunboyne's dismissal from the Yard.<br/><br/>Edges<br/>    * Former Scotland Yard inspector.<br/>    * "Intuitions" - Is it just that gut hunch that cops get ... or actual visions? <br/></blockquote>\nNow, this is the situation. I'm not happy with Intuitions as an edge -- it's (a) a bit redundant to the magical ability another character has (divination, etc) and also to a Clairvoyance ability that a character has in "Weird War Two" PTA game that I'm producing.<br/><br/>So I pitched the Producer a new Edge:\n<blockquote><br/>* "The Sight" - Put simply, Dunboyne does not (or cannot) see fae glamours.  He's only encountered two royal fae whose glamoured appearance was so strong as to seem 'real' to him.  This particular 'gift' (quite rare, but not unique, among both mortals and fae) has caused him no end of grief. <br/></blockquote>\nI likened it, from a 'safety' point of view, to drawing the Seer card in a game of Are You a Werewolf.<br/><br/>GM replies, in essence: "That's... wow... that's a hell of a powerful edge."<br/><br/>To which I reply that it really does the same thing as always: gives me one more card when I use it in a conflict.<br/><br/>However, I *do* see his point and why it presents potential challenges -- it's an always-on thing that changes what I see versus what other people see.<br/><br/>Now, I can point out something like "Scotland Yard Inspector" does the same thing, but that is (a) an ability whose resultant input upon Invoking is open to narrator-interpretation and (b) conceptually the kind of thing can be resisted, perhaps even passively by the environment (the room is dark, so you don't notice the odd striations on the floor...).  It is, in short, something that generally only 'works' when I win a conflict.<br/><br/>This "Sight" thing "works", conceptually, all the time, and only MATTERS when I win (or, just as often, I'd think, depending on the conflict, lose) a conflict.  In that sense, it's always on, and always 'working,' it's just that mechanically, it doesn't always have the right to 'matter.'<br/><br/>I see the point he's wrestling with here, and I want to see if the collective smarts of the forum here can help either him get comfortable with it, or me see that it's a bad Edge.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71374/#Comment_71374" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T08:47:53+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  8:47AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys?

I.e. are robust fey glamours crucial to the credibility of the setting?<br/><br/>4) Will this edge undercut the narrative threat of the fey, i.e. are the fey as potential antagonists rendered powerless by this edge?<br/><br/>I think it would be reasonable to reduce this edge from always on, to occasionally in-play. I think occasional use could actually be a more powerful and elegant narrative device.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71834/#Comment_71834" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T11:04:27+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 11:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as 1, I feel that it's reasonable that this should only happen in proportion to Dunboyne's stage presence.

If glamours are a critical part of the genre, then it would be contradictory to allow an edge that negated a necessary element of the genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
