                    Just so we're on the same page, in this thread I'm talking about how traditionally, RPGs have had the main player section, and then had a block of additional content for the GM's eyes only, expounded things like advice on how to hose the players, monster stats, suggested metaplot crap. You know the drill. Then these newfangled indie designs come along, wisely realize that keeping players in the dark about this stuff just encourages all sorts of bad behaviors, and assume that the whole game text is to be consumed by all participants.<br/><br/>So anyway, there's this game design I'm thinking up. There's a big horror/exploration of the unknown element to it. By force of habit, my thoughts started conceiving of material that would go into a "player section" and sooper-secret setting advice that would go into the "GM section." But wait a minute, that's so not vogue! I was sort of thinking that the prohibition against player reading would be explicitly tongue-in-cheek, but that might end up endorsing an illusionist style of play where players feign ignorance of having read the material.<br/><br/>So my question is, does the notion of a "secret GM section" have any milage left in it? What is it really good for? Or is it a sacred cow that deserves to stay dead? More importantly, what might an "enlightened" GM section look like?                </div>

                            Paranoia XP has a GM section-- but that's a dog of a different breed.<br/>D&amp;D has the whole f---in' Dungeon Master's Guide, complete with the rules for what the conscequences for PC actions should be (drowning, catching on fire, turned to stone.)  Of course, players and therefore characters should proceed in any course of action heedless of consequence; this is d&amp;D after all!<br/><br/>I know I have read every GM section in every RPG I ever bought.  I think the demise of the "GM only" material is an acknowledgement of this reality.  If you wanted to include it, I think the effect would be more nostalgic "Auld Skewl" than deep mystery.  <br/><br/>Also, if your game relies on/is enhanced by the mysteries in the GM section, what is the replayability?  Would I plunk down Mr. Jackson* on a game that I will be able to play through once before the fun starts falling out?<br/><br/>Of course GM advice in the context of your game is always welcome.  Strapping this into a chapter of it's own shouldn't be a problem.  <br/><br/>* Andrew Jackson is on the US $20 for those not native to the land of greenbacks.                        </div>

                            It's useful to delineate for your audience what parts of the text are crucial for different player roles.  If a player at the table only needs to know X to play the game, and and the one player who takes the role of the GM needs to know X and Y, letting the reader know that is valuable.  The reason is, many players (e.g. many of my players) don't enjoy reading rules or text as much as I do.  If there is a subset of knowledge that is applicable to them they only want to have to read that.  I wouldn't make my players read the Town creation rules in DITV to play.  They might find it informs their play and makes the game more interesting / cohesive.  But it's not crucial for their play so they can't be bothered.  It's a simple but unfortunate fact in my opinion.  And one that a good gaming text can recognize usefully in its structure (especially when the full text startes getting over the length that can be read in the course of a few hours).<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, this delineation lowers the barrier for entry of new player.  That's a good thing.                        </div>

                            Hmm, time to grab the reigns. If it wasn't clear from the original post, I think these sorts of sections are bollocks. Same for the notion of one person doing all the work of reading the book and everyone else showing up and expecting to be entertained. I already know why these suck, and have plenty of examples on hand.<br/><br/>I'm more or less looking for "Sell me on: The GM Section." How can it usefully not suck?<br/><br/>I had totally forgotten about Dogs. That's a great example. It's more of a "How to create the GM-stuff in a way that applies to this particular game." I think Conspiracy of Shadows does similarly well in this regard.                        </div>

                            If you have a game in which there's a special role, it doesn't make any sense for you not to tell people how to best fulfill that special role?

                            I have been thinking about this a lot lately. I want to put the "how to set up the adventure" stuff at the front of the book. Mostly to get everybody on the same page about what the adventure is, what everyone's part is and how you can make it awsome for each other. Then when they get that, I will tell them how to get the characters that will play in the adventure.                        </div>

                            I think sections that contain "advice for the GM" can be invaluable. FLFS has a great one (see my upcoming review). However, such advice is not "secret GM info."<br/><br/>A game based on horror or exploration (or other elements of the unknown) will either need to preload secret info into the GM, or give really solid advice on how to create their own secrets. You could also give a half-thousand "secrets" in the style of Unknown Armies and let GMs decide which ones to use on their own.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that a secret GM section can be done, and makes sense for some kinds of games, but does not *need* to be done if you don't mind people creating their own answers to your setting's big questions.                        </div>

<p>Any time you lay out responsibilities, it is good to advise people on how to fulfil them properly. The same goes for specific game tools.</p>
<p>If you're dividing them unevenly, then I think it makes good sense to say, "Here is a chapter of advice for Player Type A and here is Chapter B and here is Chapter C" and so on until you run out of player profiles.</p>
<p>So, yeah, y'know... provide a "how to GM good" chapter, right after "how to play a character good", or however you are cutting up your stuff. Look at how Polaris breaks down the moon phases and how to ach when you're in each one.</p>

                            Carrying on from Shreyas' point, My Life With Master has a GM section that does almost exactly that. It's the Brain In A Jar section. It takes you through the GM skills you need - framing skills aggressively, how the opening events should play out - before giving an extended play example. <br/><br/>If we're after a section of secret GM info, then I think we ought to do something like what Curly said, and do it electronically. Why would you put a GM section in a book these days, where the players are bound to read it? <br/><br/>So put it on the Internet. Give the GM a choice between different scenarios which he can run with the players: even better, randomly generate them. Randomly generate secrets, puzzles, mysteries: even dungeon maps. Have a PHP page which gives you a randomly selected adventure of the evening. <br/><br/>(Then use that page to advertise our next game).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Would the electronic GM's guide really prevent leakage to players? The way I see it, if players own the product, they get access to same content as well. And if they don't own it, is the situtation different from having a GM-only published book? GM information and aids in the web is otherwise a very good idea; another one could be putting quick play rules and stuff that player needs to web, behind protected access, so GM can print them an distribute to players, if needed.<br/><br/>Someone mentioned Unknown Armies and I really like the way the book is split into different sections depending on the campaign "level". Sure, there's the traditional GM section at the back of the book, but if you're going to do PDF publishing, one idea might be just releasing several different versions of the book.<br/><br/>Is the unknown element static in the setting or do you have tools for creating those elements in the Super Secret GM Section? If the latter, there's little harm done if players browse it through, but consider putting examples and ready-made settings in web.                        </div>

                            Hmmm ... <br/><br/>Our latest project has a section on scenario design that's intended for the GM (but not the GM <i>only</i>--there's no prohibitions or anything). Our previous project had two books and the 'super-secret mysteries.' <br/><br/>It contained a <i>note</i> that "if you are a player and wish to discover this stuff in-game you may want to stop reading here to preserve the sense of mystery." Two actually: there were two different layers of secrets (one in the first book and the entire second).<br/><br/>But I guess I just don't have the right vibe for telling the GM to hose the players over or something. Maybe I'm losing my touch.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

I've found that the kind of player who doesn't want to read rules... <i>doesn't want to read rules</i>. Ergo, separating out a "player section" is pretty pointless IMO, at least in this regard.

I'm thinking the newfangled way is less "player" vs. "GM", but "The section on how you resolve things at the table" and "The section on how you create opposition/situation."

So a question regarding adventures:  Do you think that there shouldn't be sample adventures like the sample towns in DitV or the Training Run in Sorcerer?  Or should they be there, but the players should read them first before playing them?  <br/><br/>I admit I'm intrigued by the idea of open-note adventures.  This was one of the tenets of the Turku Manifesto (a set of principles for Finnish larps).  However, I stop short of thinking that all role-playing should be that way.

I think I lean towards Curly's perspective on this.  There's an old essay by Steve Jackson about how, no matter how many times they revised the rules to <cite>Illuminati</cite> they were always a little difficult to follow, but people could teach the game to one another in about five minutes.  By extension, there's something to be said for the position that only one player <em>needs</em> to read the rules, and can explain the game to the others.                        </div>

The tricky bit to this question is that, in DitV (and probably Sorcerer, too), reading the town isn't going to "spoil" anything for the players, as the GM is ideally "spilling their guts" at the outset, anyway.

I might try it out for an upcoming game at a mini-con.  Do you have experience with playing "known" towns in DitV or similar games?  Did it change things at all?  <br/><br/>I tend to disagree about D&amp;D.  The challenge is spoiled for many tricks/traps, but most D&amp;D combat encounters work fine even if the players know they're up against.  At least, I've played in games where I or at least one player knew the published module that was being run, using D&amp;D and Gamma World.  It was still engaging for the player who knew.  Though, the understanding there was that the player who knew the modules shouldn't tell other players.  The other times when I've done this were for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dead of Night</span> and to some degree in our Buffy game, where I was switching off GMing with Bill, so we had a bunch of shared information.  Most of the time we only gave a brief "pitch" to the other GM, but there were one or two times when we planned things more closely together.  <br/><br/>The main problem would be in games where the challenge is more in mystery-solving rather than tactical -- like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Call of Cthulhu</span> or such.  Also, comedy often loses its punch if known in advance, so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paranoia</span> adventures might lose something, say.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>Anyway, for games like that, I'd say just put samples and demos up on the company website.</blockquote>
I guess that fits as a practical matter.  Put the GM-only material as downloads separate from the book.   Just so long as the book makes it clear that the material is available, rather than customers having to hear about the stuff through online forums or browsing the company site.  Ideally, I would prefer to have a separate printed book or booklet of GM material since I prefer having nicely printed and bound material rather than a PDF.                        </div>

                            Spirit of the Century definitely has what I'd call "GM's Section" type stuff (How to Run The Game / Tips &amp; Tricks in particular), and I think it's doing the right job being split out like it is.  The split, however, is solely organizational: it's not for secrecy.  It's there with its own sectional identity to say "hey dude -- this is if you want to know it, but you don't need to ingest it as a player".                        </div>

                            If you're using a traditional GM/player split, i.e. GM makes decisions about the setting, players make decisions about the characters, then the GM advice chapter should show the GM how to make those decisions. <br/><br/>Players rarely need this type of coaching, because their decisions are usually quite easy to make. Many simply do "what I would do in that situation". Some put together a kind of psychology for their character, a framework so to speak, and base their decisions on "what the character would do in that situation". Only the really passionate go beyond that and try to meticulously fit their character's personality and actions into the game's setting. <br/><br/>GMs on the other hand, sometimes have a more difficult task. I know many GMs who "make the setting their own", that is they do what ever they want or what they think the players enjoy whenever they make a decision. I don't think that those GMs ever read the GM-only section, or care much for it. But there are also GMs who, like their player-counterparts, want to have some kind of framework (a number of axioms that tells them how the setting works), they want to use when making decisions. One of the most prominent axioms is "realism", where the GM tries to base his decisions on what is most realistic, plausible or likely in this setting. Others prefer "coolness" or "humour". But these are most often GM-specific, as opposed to game-specific.<br/><br/>A good GM section would help the GM understand what kind of axioms the setting is build on, or at the very least advice on how to get the "style" of the game right. How to make "unique fantasy game" feel like "unique fantasy game", instead of Bob's Homebrew <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2323&amp;Mode=like">#23</a> or "same old fantasy game but with silly rules". In my experience it is rarely helpful to spell such things out. Instead adventures (introductory or otherwise) and fluff texts help the GM get a handle on a game's/setting's style. <br/><br/>One thing that I've always found incredibly helpful, were hearing different GMs talk about what made the setting unique. I've always wondered why GM sections never had more than one take on how to run the game printed .                        </div>

Larry, I think there is still a lot of mileage left in the Secret GM Section, it's just that we've realized that the Secret GM Section is not applicable to all games.  Books like <em>Dogs</em> or <em>FLFS</em> (with its sidebar "This is not the GM Section") don't require sections describing secrets, since whatever secrets are used in play are created for the individual play experience.  If you look at, say, <em>Thirty</em>, the whole game is hinged on a powerful, informed GM and protagonized, uninformed players.  The set up of the game requires a Secret GM Section.<br/><br/>So I think the question you need to ask is not, "Are GM Sections out of date?" so much as "Would my design benefit from a secret GM section?"                        </div>
