From my reading, it makes the most sense that everybody has to play a card and that every character can potentially die, but the outline of a standard scene ambiguously states that "Once <b>one</b> character is dead, wrap up the scene" (emphasis added). What's the correct interpretation?</li><li>Assuming that "targeting everybody" does indeed make it possible to kill all characters in a scene, why would the Killer ever choose to target a specific character? Is it simply for the player to avoid killing a favorite character, or some other reason?</li><li>In the First Blood scene, all of the characters die. In a game with five players, this means that four characters will die "right away". This seems a bit excessive given the source material. Did I see the wrong movies, or do we simply suspend our disbelief here to make for a more fun game?</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439746/#Comment_439746" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-28T16:52:40+00:00" title="October 28, 2014  4:52PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2014 4:52PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the first question: the rules later talk about the scene going on until <b>at least</b> one character is dead, and I think that's the most straightforward way to understand it. When blood is shed, the scene ends. If everyone would die, one of them survives. That last bit's called out explicitly on the bottom of page 16: "One character must live!" They have specific rules to determine that.<br/><br/>On to the second question: it seems to me that the default state is probably to threaten everyone...unless you want to single someone in particular out! Maybe because you dislike them, or some other reason. (And yes, trying to save a favorite character could also be a motive! :-) ) It seems to me that a straightforward tactic to kill one particular character would be to target them initially, then throw down a "target everyone". Remember that when characters die, they get "scored" by the players who control them. The player with the most dead characters (i.e. the player who's had the most characters die under their control) gets to narrate the ending. So...<br/><br/>And for the final question: with that many players...yeah, it's gonna be a mighty bloody game in general. I haven't seen enough slasher flicks to know, but dramatically, it seems correct that you'd have a four-character death to set the stage  for the coming drama. Think of it as the remarkably memorable opening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439754/#Comment_439754" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-28T22:42:38+00:00" title="October 28, 2014 10:42PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have the rules on hand so I can't answer your first question clearly.<br/><br/>I don't think the default is to threaten everyone.  The fiction matters.  How is the killer attacking everyone?  I read the "everyone" option for mass threats like zombie hordes, or a disease or where the killer is filling the room with flames.  But if the killer is a clown with a knife he can't threaten everyone.<br/><br/>Remember, that you play out three scenes before First Blood.  In each scene you pick new characters which may not be the same subset from scene to scene.  You have a chance to establish relationships in each of these three scenes.  In First Blood you only kill off characters who don't have relationships.  So it won't always be 4 in a 5 player game if everyone mixes it up from scene to scene in those first three scenes.<br/><br/>That said it can be more than just one or two.  If it is, just be creative.  Do they all go in one big disaster?  Are they small "first wave" of explorers encountering a threat?  It's pretty easy to justify in play.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439757/#Comment_439757" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-29T00:53:59+00:00" title="October 29, 2014 12:53AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First Blood kills off all the characters in that scene.

I don't think it's restricted by fictional positioning. I'm thinking of the one bit where they discuss "the ping-ponging killer", and ways to avert that. You could easily apply the same techniques to "targeting everyone". For instance, maybe a "target everyone" means that nobody knows where the killer is, but they're all wandering through the house, freaked out and wondering who's next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
