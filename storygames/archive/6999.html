I think sometimes this could be elitism, but other times simply it's a kind of social "quality control" that I suggest isn't all bad!<b></b></i><br/><br/>So....Shop Talk in RPGs.  In other hobbies shop talk might be discussing the Xs and Os of formations (football), all sorts of technical jargon and slang (cars, computers, you name it), to insider or created terms (poetry/creative writing).<br/><br/>So what are the equivalents in gaming?  Do you think shop talk is "quality control", an attempt to ease communication, an effort to belong a group, or, as I think, perhaps a bit of each depending on the situation.  What are some ways in which can ease communication?  In what ways do you feel, as Matt states, it can or is used as a "social quality control?"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155962/#Comment_155962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T18:03:49+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  6:03PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just call it jargon, not shop talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, sites like this one and the forge are guilty of perpetrating far more jargon than normal gaming (which just produced off acronyms every now and then.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean "narrativist?"

Experts enhance their vocabulary with new, useful terms and give existing words subtle and nuanced, contextual meanings. <br/><br/>Why? For many of the reasons you list, but not to exclude people. We're geeks. We want to breed more geeks. We're not going to exclude people interested in our ideas intentionally. Might we toss terminology around needlessly to bolster our geek cred and to establish ourselves as alpha geeks? Yeah, probably. "If you were half as smart as me, you'd realize that you've failed to take the implications of IIEE into account in your design." Might we use jargon in an attempt to impress the "uninitiated" and establish the pecking order with new gaming enthusiasts? Yeah, possibly. "Come into the circle and I shall tell you of the Threefold, young padawan." <i>Should we cut that shit out?</i> Yeah, definitely.<br/><br/>But let's not throw out the baby with the bath water. The jargon itself isn't evil. It's extremely useful when used among people with a shared context. No, we can't always agree on what things mean, but that doesn't mean the things have no value. Jargon serves as a starting point for expert discussion and a shared context for nuanced thought. Just know your audience when you use it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156081/#Comment_156081" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T09:54:32+00:00" title="July 11, 2008  9:54AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if other people jargon seems to suffer as much as our jargon. <br/>\n<br/>\nthat whole "we can't always agree on what things mean" is more or less the only criteria I can think of for jargon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly think that jargon in gaming and indie gaming is about as useful as the colour of plummage on a bird.

Nobody can force you to do so. So, if every time someone ask something about theory, he/she get only answers full of jargon, there are only a few explanations:<br/><br/>1) It's impossible to explain these things without using jargon.<br/>2) It's possible, but it's so difficult that people who hate jargon can't (or won't) do it. People who use jargon do it easily. Or care enough to do it.<br/>3) It wouldn't be much more difficult, but only people who use jargon without worrying too much about it want to answer. The others don't care enough (or simply don't know the answer)<br/><br/>So, from experience, it would seems that jargon is very useful, and so there is a very good reason to use it. and/or people who say that they don't use jargon, do so because they really don't explain anything to people (or when they do, they use jargon themselves).  (it's a generalization. There are some exceptions, but they are very few)<br/><br/>I think that some thread full of good jargon-free explanations would be much more useful in removing the widespread use of jargon than an hundred posts full of jargon-hate in these threads. until then, it's not like experience is supporting very much the opinion that jargon isn't necessary...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156131/#Comment_156131" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T14:54:19+00:00" title="July 11, 2008  2:54PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Where specialized terminology can make expert conversation easier, let's use it.

By that point all of the jargon and theory had been hashed out years ago and was being used regularly.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm different from most newbies, but I was not intimidated by the jargon.  I am very familiar with jargon from my job as a computer programmer, so I thought of it like approaching a forum for a computer language or programming environment or something.  I lurked for a long time before I posted anything; most of my questions had already been asked and answered, so I followed links, read glossaries, and figured stuff out from context.  I found "anyway" and some other blogs around the same time and did the same thing there: lurk, read, think, digest.<br/><br/>I didn't think jargon was being used in an exclusionary way at all.  I was like, "Thank goodness!  Finally!  Somebody has come up with a vocabulary for precisely describing all this stuff so we can talk about it without going around in circles!  Now I just have to learn it."<br/><br/>Computer programming, although not quite as jargon-infested as law, medicine, or the sciences, depends on a ton of jargon.  file, function, argument, expression, string, block, class, method, array, variable, index, tag, object, pointer...  I could list these all day.  When we use these words we mean something very precise and specific that is not at all what a normal English-speaking human being would mean by them.<br/><br/>We don't use jargon to show off our smarts.  We use them because without them, software that takes more than one person to write would not exist, because communication would be <b>impossible</b>.  We would have to talk like this all day:  "You know those things that are like chunks of program code where you put some data in and it spits out some other data?  Is there a way that I can make two of those and then give one of them as input to the other one and then the other one takes the first one and uses it on some of the other stuff that I gave it?"<br/><br/>Back in grad school sometimes I would tutor students, and if I was using a jargon word but they thought it was the English word, hilarious misunderstandings would ensue.  As soon as I figured this out I would always teach them the jargon, because that was better for our long-term communication than trying to re-describe the concept using imprecise English words every time it came up.<br/><br/>There's another kind of programmer jargon, too: words that aren't precisely defined, but we use them to express our feelings about code and our intuition about bugs.  If somebody hands me some code and says "Look out, it's pretty klugy" vs. "it's pretty crufty" vs. "it's pretty brittle", then in all three cases I know I'm going to have some work to do improving it, but in each case the nature of the work will be different.  By pointing me in the right direction with the word "klugy" my coworker probably saved me hours.<br/><br/>RPG theory and jargon for their own sake are useless, but they can be applied in two useful ways:  for designing new games, and for diagnosing problems in existing role-playing groups.  I can't count how many games I've had fall apart or end in arguments or just peter out due to lack of fun.  In just about every case I can remember, I can trace the problem back to the people involved in the game having invisible disagreements that they did not have the language to communicate about effectively.  Disagreements about what the goal of play was, how we expected each other to play, what was acceptable behavior, what we were trying to do, who was expected or allowed to make what decisions, what should be rolled for vs. what should be negotiated vs. what the GM would fiat, and so on ad nauseum.  Without the language to describe what they were unhappy with, everything turns into name-calling and frustration and "You guys just don't know how to roleplay right!" and "You just won't let us have any fun!".  It's ugly.<br/><br/>By all means, let's not lord jargon over people or use it to show off!  But look, gamerdom at large has no trouble coining phrases like 'min-maxing', 'railroad', and 'NPC', and none of those are words that first-timers just magically know; they all have to be taught.  What's the difference between that and Forge jargon?  Only that the latter has gone a lot farther in coming up ways to describe the many subtle and abstract things that can screw up your roleplaying experience if you don't understand them.  These things need to be talked about, one way or another.  Having a common vocabulary doesn't guarantee that the problems will be solved, but at least it's a starting point.<br/><br/>I think we should use jargon whenever it's appropriate, after (of course!) first giving a definition, so that we can spread useful vocabularly words to a wider audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156150/#Comment_156150" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T18:49:37+00:00" title="July 11, 2008  6:49PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2008 6:53PM by Andy.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I submit, however, that some jargon is difficult to understand because the concepts it represents are hard to understand or, more importantly, not well understood by<i>anyone</i>.

Now I agree with the Dray/Tevis thing, nice and succinct.<br/><br/>But my aside was that I would also, in those conversations, bring up the fact that all sorts of fields had specialized jargon, like science and engineering (because I like science and engineering, and so it was the easiest term pool/reference area within reach), to which the retort was a meteor cry of:<br/><br/>"So you're saying that RPG Theory is as IMPORTANT as SCIENCE or ENGINEERING!?!", which is kinda both a strawman wrapped up like bacon around an excluded middle.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1924/images/1924_MEDIUM.jpg"/><br/>MMMmm, Delicious Strawman-wrapped Excluded Middle<br/><br/>But on later thinking about it (again, this was long after I gave up on speaking my mind on the subject, back in 2004/5 or so), I think that a better example that I *wish* I used was something like Photoshop or Needlepoint.<br/><br/>Like, if I went to a needlepoint forum and start waving my hands and screaming: "Take your <i>blocking</i> and your <i>pattern darning</i> and your <i>notions</i> and your <i>tension </i>and fuck off, elitist swine!", or went to a web graphic design seminar and stood up saying, "<i>Gradient? Path? Flare? Layers?</i> Why are you using these terms that I don't understand?? Why are you perpetuating your <i>exclusionary jargon</i>???", then I would pretty much be a fucking twit.<br/><br/>There's a balance in there somewhere.

But I like to hear Matthew Gandy's stories about cool stuff that happened, when he dumbs the terms down and just treats me as an outsider.<br/><br/>But then when Matthew talks to Quintin or others who play MMOs, they can converse using terms like Buffs, DPS, "Eeeps", Aggro, Mobs, etc. To which I *sorta* can figure out given enough context, but sometimes get lost with. <br/><br/>So if I want to begin to play WoW (I went through the 10-day demo, it was cute), I don't need to know all that shit. I can just get into it over time, or just dick around and play. But if I want to level to 70th and join a raiding guild to hit all the high-level group dungeons ('raids'), I can't be in a chat with my 70th level guildmates while planning the raid strategy going "What the fuck is aggro? What do you mean by buffs? Where is "WF"? Why are you deliberately excluding me from your conversation!" <br/><br/>(or alternately, in reality (where I see the argument made on various RPG sites) it would be like me, a die hard FPS and console RPG guy with little MMO experience, wandering somehow into a forum dedicated to a raiding clan and taking them to task for using all this exclusionary jargon which I don't understand."<br/><br/>+-+-+-+-+-<br/><br/>Ack, I thought of a good counterpoint: Having said the above, there are a lot of Forge-Design terms that are still largely undefined or mean something different to every person using it, or that employ words that sound like one thing but mean another. Yeah, on that level the analogy totally falls apart, I guess. In WoW, no one argues about what DPS really means, or if WF means Westfall. Hmmm, yeah it makes the waters murkier, I admit. <br/><br/>My personal conclusion is that I use RPG Playing Jargon ("crits", "PHB", "PTA", "Say Yes or Roll the Dice", "Munchkin"), and some "Hard" design terms ("conflict resolution", "task resolution", "resolution mechanic"), but pretty much none of what I say above, to me anyway, applies to how I view stuff like "GNS", etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156160/#Comment_156160" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T20:11:28+00:00" title="July 11, 2008  8:11PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In case I'm the only one who's seeing this, the original intent (as I grasp it) of this thread was not to address the indie/story/theory jargon as jargon in the hobby at large.<br/><br/>So the idea is to think more about common jargon such as d6 (instead of what anyone who's never seen any other type of die would just call dice), GM and HP than IWNAY, GNS and IIEE. <br/><br/>I mean sure.. the generic ideas about jargon apply to both sorts, but the thread from which this one spawns was about "gamer culture" rather than "indie/story gamer culture". Unless I'm wrong about Zach's original post, it's counter-productive to attack or defend our specific corner of the hobby's jargon.<br/><br/>For the rest, I think jargon in our hobby springs primarily from ease of use. It's easier to say hit points than "number used to track how much damage your character has taken", and easier still to say/write HP. First comes the concept, then the label, then the abbreviation for the label until we're flinging around abbreviations, letters, made-up terms that stuck, and new meanings for old terms enough to rival doctors and engineers. And that's before you even consider the new concepts pioneered in our off-the-main-drag little section of the culture. <br/><br/>Is there any exclusionary intent in the birth of our jargon? I would say absolutely not. Is there any exclusionary intent in the individual usage? Well, the answer to that can be found in the word "individual". <br/><br/>All we can really do about the jargon is make sure we're not among those individuals using it for the wrong purposes. <br/><br/>Andy,<br/><br/>What IS that wrapped inside the bacon? egg-whites?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156164/#Comment_156164" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T21:08:25+00:00" title="July 11, 2008  9:08PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait...Who wants to play with people who won't or can't learn new words?

I doubt this applies to anyone here on S-G.  It may not even apply to most gamers or even most geeks.  But there are definitely people out there that enjoy feeling "superior" to others.  One easy way to do this is, when discussing a topic the other person isn't familiar with or, perhaps, teaching someone how to play a role-playing game, use a lot of terms they won't understand.  When they ask about, them don't explain.  Say something like, "Oh, it'll make sense later."  or "I'll come back to that."  Then move on and flood them with more jargon.  When you try to explain what to do to make, say, a to-hit roll in combat, do so very quickly and when they don't understand, sigh and then just say, "I'll do it for you."  Or shove some dice at them and say, "Just roll these."<br/>Ta-da!  You've confused the heck of someone with your superior knowledge of an obscure and arcane hobby.  They feel dumb, lost, or annoyed.  They probably never want to play one of these games again.  But that's cool, right?  You didn't newbies in your game that would slow things down with the need for explanations and hand-holding.<br/><br/>Of course, in reality, if you're this kind of person, a lack of jargon probably isn't going to stop you from being an asshole.  And there isn't a lot anyone else can do to stop you from being an asshole except possibly try to reach these people before you do.<br/><br/>On a slightly more relevant note, like everyone else in the world, I get pretty excited when I'm talking about things that I'm enthusiastic about.  When I'm excited, it's easy to start talking quickly, pouring the thoughts that are already inside my head out into the air.  It's pretty easy, when doing that, to use the terms you use in your own head.  Even if you aren't INTENDING to exclude people or scare them away, if you're going fast and using a lot of weird/unusual terms, it could be problematic.  Especially if you're trying to talk to someone who might be shy and think they will sound "stupid" if they interrupt to ask for clarification.<br/><br/>So in the end, I'm not necessarily all for destroying jargon.  But I think it's good to remember that it can and is used in a destructive fashion, sometimes intentionally and sometimes accidentally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156223/#Comment_156223" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T12:47:37+00:00" title="July 12, 2008 12:47PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, I get the sense you're working through your thoughts there.

I don't understand why anyone would rather talk about the latter, except as a component of the former? I'm not trying to poop on everybody's cornflakes, but I was kind of interested in the thread after reading the initial post, but all anybody seems to be talking about is whether using specialized language is good or bad? This is the equivalent of asking whether speaking English is good or bad.<br/><br/>The answer, for me, is as obvious as anything: it depends. It depends on what kind of use you are putting your language to, what your goals are, and what the larger social context is. That's where shop talk comes in, presumably -- what is its social context, what purposes does it serve, and <i>are those</i> purposes good or bad?<br/><br/>To me shop talk is different than, say, serious debate about a topic (another place where you see a lot of jargon) -- it's a bonding experience, and it is absolutely about using language to both include and exclude people socially.<br/><br/>Shop talk is inclusive because, by its nature, it invites any qualified speaker to join the conversation. If I hear two football fans going over the details of some formation or set of plays on the bus, and I know what they're talking about? I have absolutely no qualms about jumping into the conversation -- and in most cases I would guess they'd be overjoyed. The same goes for a bunch of geeks randomly gabbing about Star Trek episodes, or gamers discussing the optimal build for a 3e fighter. 'Shop Talk' is open to anyone who is part of the larger social circle it invokes: not the circle of friends having the conversation, but the circle of aficianados who know something about the topic that's being shop-talked. The language used serves as a solid indicator of what kind of conversation is going on, though it's not a guarantee -- it might turn out the football fans are actually settling some personal argument, or having a weight philosophical discussion that has other prerequisites for joining.<br/><br/>Shop talk is exclusive because, hey, some people have no idea who Janeway is or what a feat tree looks like or where to find the best purple drops. But it's not just as simple as they don't recognize the words: they don't have the knowledge. The words are just a stand-in. We can imagine a situation where somebody learned to play WoW in a bubble, using their own specialized language for 'drop' and 'aggro' and whatever -- they would hear this conversation and be unable to join in, and that would be bad. That would be a failure of the system, where language becomes an accidental barrier instead of a purposeful one.<br/><br/>But that situation is pretty rare, I think, even though it is what everybody in these threads seems to like to fixate on -- this hypothetical situation where in fact the third party does know what 'simulationism' means, they just don't know the word, and so they are going to accidentally be excluded from the conversation.<br/><br/>I guess my thought is that the ways in which shop talk works, above, seem extremely socially functional to me. I like the fact that if I'm on the bus and I hear some dudes saying 'd20' and 'level 4 spell' that this is a strong indicator that maybe I could join the conversation. I also like the fact that if I'm on the bus talking with my friend about 'scene framing' and 'the fruitful void' then the random D&amp;D guy with no background in indie games <i>does not</i> join the conversation. I don't want him to join the conversation, because he's not going to be able to contribute anything.<br/><br/>Now I think some people have this idea in the back of their mind that the goal of conversation about gaming should be to recruit more and more people into gaming. So they imagine this bus scenario and they think 'but I do want to talk to that D&amp;D guy, I want to educate him and explain all this new stuff'. Fine -- that's not shop talk, that's a completely different conversation. If a bunch of dudes are talking about cars in technical language, and I have this vague idea that I like cars, it's my job to ask them if maybe they're willing to change conversations for me -- change to the 'teach this guy who likes cars how a carburator works and how you can tell what the hottest car on the market is' conversation. But there's no reasonable way for these guys to have the conversation they want to have -- shop talk -- while simultaneously allowing someone else with no clue to join in. There has to be a shift.<br/><br/>Insofar as shop talk is about two people geeking out and enthusiastically celebrating their interest in a topic, it is going to automatically advertise that topic: people find enthusiasm and celebration interesting. This is true even if they don't know what the people are saying. I mean, haven't you ever watched some people conversing in a foreign language, all excited, and wished you spoke Tagalog or ASL or whatever, so that you could be 'in on' whatever it was they were saying? That seems pretty natural, and there are lots of social avenues or ways to try and join in. But none of them involve complaining that these damn Filipinos refuse to speak English and who do they think they are, anyways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156270/#Comment_156270" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T22:23:11+00:00" title="July 12, 2008 10:23PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, since I'm the one who misinterpreted the meaning, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I'd like to point out that the original post discussed exlusive terms, which IS jargon, more than the commeraderie of gamers hanging around a shop shooting the bull. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, if you're not a regular at the shop, it'll be a little intimidating.

My hypothesis is that, in any community where there is a focus on making new things, there is also a focus on finding new ways to talk about them.  For comparison, see skateboarding.<br/><br/>That, in turn, has some effects on shop talk.  The innovators in design and/or theory have a larger pool of terms available than others in the community, since they're the ones inventing the jargon.  Everyone else can talk shop, but they're behind the curve a little bit.  Whether you're struggling up that curve, or driving it forward from the edge seems like it has some connection to self-perceived status in the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
