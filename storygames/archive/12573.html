Nice, metal pieces in many different colours (with soldier, cavalry, and cannon), cards (each with a type of unit and a specific territory), and a few six-sided dice.<br/><br/>It's a little too long and slow (and complicated) for her to enjoy, though (she's quite young, you know). Plus it's not terribly fun for two players. On top of that, I don't really like how the game works (gameplay is kind of predictable, too many choke points, little tactics involved). And it takes way too long to play out to completion.<br/><br/>I told her: "Pick any two continents, we'll use only those to play." And then changed the rules a bit to make it simpler and more fast-paced.<br/><br/>Then we played again yesterday. This time I added some rules to differentiate cavalry and cannon units (normally used to indicate number of armies) from regular soldier units. (Cavalry and cannon killed more enemies when attacking, but didn't defend as well as soldiers. This alone made things way more interesting.)<br/><br/>I also considered, a while ago, adding a rule where you can use cards you win to "sail" across an ocean, delivering units onto another continent. Heck, maybe then you wouldn't need to fill up the whole map to start...<br/><br/>How would you make Risk more fun?<br/><br/>Ideally, it would be a) simple, b) quick to play (within an hour or hour-and-a-half), and maybe, for bonus points, interesting in some kind of social interaction (a la Diplomacy) or in some kind of simple story gamey way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282344/#Comment_282344" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T07:43:00+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  7:43AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always wanted to be able to use the countries on the cards for more, especially if you don't currently occupy that country.

I have no idea where the rules came from, but none of us made them up.  Possibly they came via the MITSGS.  The virtue of Plague Risk was that you couldn't possibly take it seriously -- heck, sometimes the plagues won and everyone lost.  This was fine, as the get together was as much about hanging out and talking as it was about playing.<br/><br/>Anyway, any time in combat a double six was rolled, a plague was created, and when triple sixes were rolled, two plagues were created.  You immediately stopped play, and resolved the plague.  If a plague led to another plague, then you pushed the current plague on the stack, and resolved the new plague.  When you finished, you fell back to the previous plague.<br/><br/>To determine where a plague occurred, you drew a card and the plague attacked that country.  Then you rolled a die to determine the type of plague:<ol><li>Wipeout Plague</li>\n<li>Wipeout Plague</li>\n<li>Wipeout Plague</li>\n<li>Andromeda Plague</li>\n<li>Robot Plague</li>\n<li>Jack the Ripper Plague</li></ol>\n<ul><li>A Wipeout Plague simply destroyed all units on the country, leaving it empty.</li>\n<li>An Andromeda Plague got the current amount of forces you would get from the next card match, and attacked that country from space.  If any units survived, it would move all of its units into that country, then immediately detect the largest number of units (including those belonging to another Andromeda Plague) within three moves, and start attacking its way to that (roll dice to break ties), leaving only a single unit behind per country.  Once that group was destroyed, it would find the largest collection of units within three moves from its current position, and repeat the process.  If necessary, it would attack other Andromeda Plague units in order to get to other enemies.  If there were no groups of pieces larger than any other within three moves, the Plague would instead attack a randomly selected neighboring country. Once the Andromeda Plague could no longer attack, all of its units would vanish, leaving empty countries.</li>\n<li>A Robot Plague was just like an Andromeda Plague, the remaining pieces did not vanish when the plague ended.</li>\n<li>A Jack the Ripper Plague was sort of like a Robot Plague, except instead of attacking from space, the owner got the number of pieces from the next card match, and then they would go berserk, following the rules for a Robot Plague, except friendly units were not counted when looking for the largest group of pieces within three moves.  A Jack the Ripper Plague would attack friendly units if they were in the shortest path to enemy units.  When a random determination would be called for a Robot or Andromeda Plague, the Jack the Ripper Plague units owner would decide instead.</li></ul>\nEmpty countries could be moved in from any adjacent country on a player's turn.  Units moving into an empty country could not move any further that turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282505/#Comment_282505" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T14:40:27+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  2:40PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Peter!

However, they cannot "operate" by themselves--they are effectively neutral units, controlled by whoever owns the territory they're in. So, if you capture a territory with a cannon in it, it becomes yours.<br/><br/>A defender who thinks they're about to lose a fight can forfeit one round of rolling to destroy all of their remaining cannons (leaving none for the enemy).<br/><br/>(You'd need slightly different dice rules to make this work--which is fine, I'm planning to change them somehow anyway.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282536/#Comment_282536" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T17:48:46+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  5:48PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so Risk 2210 has lots of cards you can buy if you have the right commanders, and spend energy on them. There's Land cards, which give you extra troops, do bad things to people who attack your land territories, etc. There's Water cards, which do the same for your water territories. There's Lunar Cards, which do the same up there, and also let you do things like invade earth (pick a random land territory, any of your lunar spots can attack that territory this turn) etc. There's Diplomacy cards, which do fiddly things like cancel attacks (I think?) and steal other people's Energy. I haven't played in years, so I'm probably forgetting some of the cool things those cards do.<br/><br/>Then there's the nuke cards. Full of energy-expensive wonders like "draw three land territories and rain death down upon enemies in them" and things like that. But the kingpin? Armageddon. You play it, and then everyone gets to play as many nuke cards as they want (from their hand) for free.<br/><br/>And the mere existence of Armageddon means that, as soon as one person starts buying lots of nukes, there's a large incentive to start trying to get a decent stockpile of your own.

Mind you, sick armies could be easier to overcome than healthy ones, but holding vast swathes of land might not help you much if humanity gets wiped out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282743/#Comment_282743" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-24T11:08:52+00:00" title="July 24, 2010 11:08AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Cool, Peter! Sounds very wacky.<br><br>One thing I've been considering:<br/><br/>Cannons are powerful units of some sort. However, they cannot "operate" by themselves--they are effectively neutral units, controlled by whoever owns the territory they're in. So, if you capture a territory with a cannon in it, it becomes yours.<br/><br/>A defender who thinks they're about to lose a fight can forfeit one round of rolling to destroy all of their remaining cannons (leaving none for the enemy).<br/><br/>(You'd need slightly different dice rules to make this work--which is fine, I'm planning to change them somehow anyway.)</br></br></blockquote>\nSilly side note: this sounds rather a lot like H.G. Wells' "Little Wars" (Which used little toothpick shooting cannon to literally knock down opposing tin soldiers from afar, and the cannon could be captured).<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Little Wars and Floor Games both suggest some delightful ways to play with your young relatives using toys and principally your imagination. Some of the suggestions are like proto-story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283572/#Comment_283572" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T15:32:06+00:00" title="July 29, 2010  3:32PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2010 3:32PM by John_Powell.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>How would you make Risk more fun?<br/></blockquote>\nUse the dice for a roleplaying game. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Seriously, I received Risk 2210 for my birthday this year.
