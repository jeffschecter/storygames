What's out there that costs between $5 and $1? I think I'm primarily interested in stand-alone games, as opposed to supplement-type stuff.

Those two scenarios are often Pelgrane's second- and third- best selling products of the month (after whichever big thing has just been released).<br/><br/>The lesson there, I think, is that dropping the price needn't reduce your profit, because your sales increase.<br/><br/>You also needn't write something as <i>long</i> for that price, so the word count pressure is off. However, the quality must still be there. You've still got to playtest, revise, edit properly and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277887/#Comment_277887" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T12:55:48+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 12:55PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://memento-mori.com/online-store/action-castle/" rel="nofollow">Action Castle</a> &amp;

Honestly, I can think of a lot of indie games that I would like more if they were 50-90% shorter, so this is pretty exciting.  I really want to see the "RPGs as tiny booklets" meme keep spreading, partially because it makes publishing even more accessible, as long as we simultaneously keep raising the bar for quality and accessibility of game texts.  Sure, you can have relatively quick turnaround with micropublishing (as with Gun Thief or XXXtream Street Luge) and spin out a cool idea into a clever little game, but there's also room for some breakout successes in this category, which we could see if Lady Blackbird ever comes out in this format, for example.

It's crazy, but I've been sitting here toiling on this book for the entire day without realizing that I'm actually publishing a super-cheap game myself while telling everybody how low prices tend to be a downer for me. How hypocritical of me - must be something in SS that makes me not equate its low price with a lack of quality. Probably something to do with the sheer amount of text in the thing, it doesn't seem like "micro" anything.

A full book with explanation on how to roleplay, inspirational art, sample scenarios, sample characters, and examples at full price. <br/><br/>Then a second version at a fraction of the size for experienced roleplayers. A very low production version that assumes you've played many games and probably won't play by the book anyway so it focuses on what's different about this game.  <br/><br/>Both still need to be extensively playtested. <br/><br/>There are many problems with the above. Is there such thing as a general audience? Is this games similar enough to other games that roleplaying experience can fill in gaps properly to make play functional? But food for thought! I suspect this approach would garner a lot of sales at Gencon, especially with both versions for sale next to each other. <br/><br/>You could also include an option to upgrade versions! Or make the 2nd version PDF only. You can have a printed copy available for browsing and when people want to buy, just email it them right then and there!

I mean, can you imagine if we tried to talk about whether a games content makes it micro?* Jeez.<br/><br/><i>*Please please please don't go down that road.</i><br/><br/>I think it's been pretty well established at this point that there is a strong PDF market, and that PDF's can be a solid part of a games release (whether as a preview, a parallel product or an always-included bonus). The cool thing about PDF's from the publishing standpoint is that they're essentially free money. It's actually pretty hard to make a print product that's only $5 with general print-on-demand technology, unless the page count is super low - especially once you include shipping. So how is a print micro-published product achieved?<br/><br/>- Be like Joe and have a low page count + a printer that specializes in the kind of printing he needs.<br/>- Be like Ben and DIY<br/>- Do an offset run to get unit costs super low (which is what I think Kevin did with Sweet Agatha, tho it's not micro)<br/>- Use the print product as a loss leader and compensate with PDF sales. Is anyone doing this? it's counterintuitive, but here's some numbers out of my butt:<br/><br/>Say I have a 20p game, and I want to print it through, oh, MagCloud. As far as I can tell from not actually having signed up with MagCloud yet, it would be $4.00 to print and $1.40 to ship. Let's assume that for whatever reason I'm fulfilling them myself, and it's important to me to keep to the $5 price point including shipping. <br/><br/>There's also a PDF version, with additional or exclusive content. It is also $5, and the print version has a clear "buy the PDF and get these extras" sell line. Hypothetical customer goes "Hey, that's cool", clicks to it and spends another $5 for the PDF.<br/><br/>So:<br/>$4 (print) + 1.40 (shipping to me) + 1.40 (shipping to customer) = $6.80 - $5 (cover) = -1.80<br/>$5 (PDF) - ~.50 (paypal fees or whatever - some fraction will go somewhere) = +4.50<br/>Total profit: $2.70<br/><br/>So to break even you would need roughly 2 PDF sales for every three print sales.<br/><br/>Is this worth it? Who knows, but it's an idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278050/#Comment_278050" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T12:00:48+00:00" title="June 26, 2010 12:00PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>It also makes a game more appealing for people like me who decide to buy a book, but also want it NOWNOWNOW!!!! while waiting for the postman to show up with the hardcopy.</blockquote>\nHeh.

(Both form a math perspective and from an empirical one. I would have given Joe $10 for that.[1]) But then he also had fewer costs, so he could reduce his margin and lower the price.<br/><br/>- Ryan<br/><br/>[1] And for all I know I did.

And I did give it back to you afterwards, so you could have checked.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>So, If Joe's Gun Thief was at $2/unit, selling it for $8-$10 would not be unreasonable. (Both form a math perspective and from an empirical one. I would have given Joe $10 for that.[1]) But then he also had fewer costs, so he could reduce his margin and lower the price.</blockquote>\nThe $5 price point on Gun Thief also reflects how much work I put into finishing it. If I'd started charging $10 for it, I feel like that would have communicated a longer production schedule, more playtesting, a profesh editor, and more.<br/><br/>$3 profit (on both the PDF and the print version) was the amount I felt like I'd earned: I'd playtested it a number of times, including once externally. I'd re-written the text and self-edited it. I'd layed it out pretty, but the only art included was free vector stuff that found its way into the grungy border splashes.<br/><br/>So, for me, that price point was about: <i>feeling like my effort was worth it, feeling rewarded on each individual sale, communicating something about the level of polish I put in, giving people something they would value.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
