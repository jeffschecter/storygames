It's the facination we have with the fantasy genre and roleplaying design.  I mean, how many FRPGs have come out?  Hundreds?  Yet, we still create, buy, and play new ones.  At the moment, I have a friend Brian working on one.  Judd is working on one, I think.  Ron wrote Sorcerer and the Sword.  Vincent has his Ars Magica knockoff and Dragon Killer.  I am fighting the temptation to do one all the time.<br/><br/>It's not a bad thing at all.  I think it's great, personally.  But the question I'm interested in is "Why?"  Like, why are we so attracted to and re-attracted to the fantasy genre?  (No genre arguments, please).  It's just spectacular to me that after 30+ years of RPGs, we still want new ones.  Why is it that?  Why do we (or you) like it so much?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58118/#Comment_58118" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T15:28:20+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  3:28PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I feel like the games that exist are focused on colour rather than structure, so we leave them dissatisfied when we go looking for <em>fantasy stories</em> rather than just <em>whatever stories in fancy dress-up clothes.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58124/#Comment_58124" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T15:53:09+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  3:53PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hard to tell how much is historical contingency with <i>Dungeons and Dragons </i>, but it's probably worth noting that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord of the Rings </span> is consistently one of the most popular works of the 20th century.

It's probably the most widely read piece of genre fiction in the English language.

There was a Sell Me On: Fantasy thread a while ago -- I think I started it -- that talked about similar issues.<br/><br/>My sixty-second considered opinion is that fantasy is actually incredibly <em>easy</em> -- of all the genres out there, fantasy is the least tied to the real world and has the lowest barrier to entry.  Science fiction seems to require some rudimentary science (so you can technobabble about orbits and energy conduits and whatever).  Westerns seem to require some rough historical understanding, or at least geography (We're where, again?  And that's how far from civilization?  How rough is the frontier here?).  Noir requires... hell, that sort of genre gestalt thinking about how "things are supposed to work" much more than fantasy, as well as the ability to make appropriate period references.  Superspy stuff makes you feel inferior if you don't know about the present global geopolitical situation.  And so on.<br/><br/>Anyway, Fantasy's easy: I have a sword, that's a monster.  I stick the sword in the monster.

This is all very abstract and debatable.<br/>But in the Zotesian Kingdom, there is a possessed scepter. Anyone who takes it will be powerful beyond belief, but will lose their soul (your soul being a concrete currency here) and will slowly transform into a snake.<br/><br/>So much of the grey area is removed. And when something turns out to be different than you expected, this is often significant - a betrayal, mind control, a corrupting spell, etc - rather than being commonplace and all-too-familiar.<br/><br/>To echo Joshua's comment, it is easy... because it is concrete.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58150/#Comment_58150" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T17:48:13+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  5:48PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go beyond what Joe says, and say that fantasy implies a <b>rule</b> that the abstract is concrete.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelling a fantasy story, you're not merely using the structures of story to encapsulate a tale.  The structures are <b>part of the tale</b>.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the difference, really, between saying "This character is the protagonist" and "This boy has a great destiny before him"?  To my mind, the one is the in-fiction version of the other.  On many important levels, the people in a fantasy story <i>know they're in a story</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what makes it such a draw for RPGs:  You get a softer barrier between the author and the character, the <i>player</i> and his role.  Many of the thoughts are shared.  Both of you, for instance, think that the young man has a great destiny before him.  And, honestly, you think it in very much the same way.

It's fantastic. It's creative, and we love to be creative. Creativity is childrens play for us, and we need it. :-)<br><br>In my view, as a storyteller and gamesmith, fantasy is the genre which take up the mantle of old time stories and myths, and as such it has inherited a whole bunch of powerful symbols (good and evil, the beast within, etc.). These symbols may seem outdated and dull to modern man, but they are still very much alive. They are full of the power thousands of years of storytelling has given them. Read Stephen Donaldson; The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, and you get an intelligent discussion of the paradox of an atheist man and the powerful symbolic power of God/Devil (and a great fantasytale).<br><br>Or, as Joepub and TonyLB says: in fantasy everything is concrete. It describes the world in exactly the same way that our forefathers did; with <b>Thor the thunder god</b> being the "real" thunder.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58192/#Comment_58192" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T02:29:51+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  2:29AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 2:31AM by Alex.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In addition to abstract concepts becoming concrete (as in the cursed artifact of greed example), I think fantasy is fascinating because we can express abstract actions very concretely, too: characters can make big sweeping moral statements while swinging their swords and whatnot. Fantasy weds the two very nicely, which makes a powerful way to deliver both intellectual and visceral fulfillment at the same time. Also, there are very few stories that actually get worse if you add some blood and death to the mix.<br/><br/>Also, as mentioned, it's narratively convenient: you don't have to worry about a lot of verisimilitude, typical fantasy societies are pretty loose, which gives the protagonists a lot of room to flex their muscles and do impressive things without bumping into social constraints (this is a big draw of Westerns, too, I think), the characters' day to day lives are naturally simpler, and it's pretty easy for someone who's read a book or two to grasp the basic structure of quest fiction. You've got a pretty easy-to-learn structure for what the characters should be doing and tons of motivation for them to go out and do it. Nice and accessible.<br/><br/><br/>Overall, I think the biggest thing that keeps me coming back is that the fantasy genre is so good for myth-making: even if the story we're creating in play ends up rather lumpy and poorly-worded and I end up throwing in some awkward scenes along the way, the final thing we've created still has the kernel of something really potent in it (myth). And that myth is really cool by itself, but it's also a big relief to have it there, since I feel more secure knowing that I probably won't sink the whole session if I occasionally drop the ball. I think that's a big draw, subconsciously for a lot of players I've personally encountered: the sense that you won't break anything if you screw up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58200/#Comment_58200" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T03:25:03+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  3:25AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In addition to everything said here, I think fantasy is the mainstay for RPGs for the same reason the Superheroes are for American comics. It's what we're used to. This is very true in comics. Kids grow up reading superheroes, love superheroes, and when they get a chance to do a comic naturally do superheroes. This was super true for a long time, but it's beginning to change. More and more people are entering the American comics field that never read superheroes but were instead inspired by European, Japanese, South American or American Small press comics.These people don't see superheroes as the norm. They didn't grow up loving these characters. They never read these books.  So they see no reason (or little reason) to do them. Instead they make comics about whatevr the hell they want. I think the same thing is true of RPGs. Most of us are influenced heavily by the games we played early on. Even if they arn't all fantasy most of our games have character sheets, use dice and come in manual form. Not all certainly, but most.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who are starting to get into games that have no experience with D&amp;D; or any other "classic" system. There are people whose first game experience is Breaking the Ice or Contenders or whatever. When they think of what RPGs are these will be the games they think of.

Familiarity also shouldn't be underrated as a factor.<br/><br/>The thing is, most fantasy gaming like most fantasy fiction isn't terribly fantastic.  It's a conservative genre by and large, and most games are not concretising myths or anything like that, they're simply being unchallenging.<br/><br/>Oh, one last thing, if the setting is bland and formulaic that can help with character focussed play, rather bizarrely.  As since the setting is dull and like every other fantasy setting, the only thing that is really different is the characters, so those are what people care about.  Too interesting a setting may draw attention away from the characters, which in most games are the primary vehicle for the players' creative input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58218/#Comment_58218" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T05:44:26+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  5:44AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 5:45AM by jake richmond.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">In an sf game the characters have access to police, internet, high tech solutions, in the modern day much the same applies.

Fantasy, in the sense of swords-and-sorcery or traditional heroic fantasy, is a conservative, concrete milieu that ties into some very old motifs we in the west all learn from fairy tales. And not just the motifs, but the transformation of abstract into concrete as well; concrete thinking was the first kind of thinking, historically, and the first kind we learn as children. We learned to abstract later, first through metaphor, then through less concrete concepts. Immersing ourselves in pseudomedieval European fantasies returns us to our childhood and puts us in touch with a golden age. Westerns and Superheros do, too, but they are much newer and thus not as strong or deep as heroes with swords. Fantasy was old when Robert E. Howard and Tolkien were creating their stories. It was old when Thomas Mallory wrote about a king who had been dead for several centuries. And before fantasy became <em>medieval</em>, it was still an ancient core of our being. The Greek writer Hesiod was the first (that I know of) to talk about a lost age of heroes.</p>\n<p>we all occasionally want to get back to simpler times, and medieval European fantasy, while not universal, has the broadest appeal in western society.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58305/#Comment_58305" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:56:45+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:56AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to agree with the "it's easy" comments.  Part of this is because of fantasy's connection to myth, and how a lot of mythical archetypes cross cultural barriers and resonate strongly with people.  Also, nearly all roleplaying games made to date have emulated some form of media or genre whether it's the fantasy novel, or television shows, or whatever.  Fantasy novels specifically are pretty simple, even more so than fantasy in the broader sense.

Is this going to be a game about day-to-day happenings in London, or a system for setting up allegories to Homeric poems, or a Modernist day-dream-like lark?  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake" rel="nofollow">Finnegan's Wake</a> would be even worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58391/#Comment_58391" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T15:12:03+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  3:12PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, we've mostly been talking about this side of "abstract becomes concrete": it's easier to deal with abstract stuff.<br/>But there's another side: whenever you do something concrete, it's got this rich abstract stuff behind it.

Salvatore)<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>b) You didn't have a role in creating it. You were "just" a consumer of it.

Most people I've known who play D&amp;D; play it becasue thats what they have. or because thats what their group has decided to play. They arn't really aware that theres a choice. That there are other games out there. For them it's a choice between 4-5 fantasy games like D&amp;D; which are all pretty much the same, Vampire, Exalted or maybea sci-fi game like Star Wars. It's not that D&amp;D; is the game they want it to be, it's just that they don't have anyting to replace it with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe flip side of that is people are hesitant to try new things, even if the old thing is not really working for them. Again, most people I've known who play D&amp;D; do so grudgingly. Every week they go to a game that they don't really want to go to. often you have to force a new game into their hands before they can see that they have a choice and that there is different and better stuf available that actually gives them what they want. Thats how it was for me, and thats how it's been for many people I know. I'm sure for a great many people D&amp;D; is the perfect game, but I'm certain that's not the case for most people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\njake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59023/#Comment_59023" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T10:56:17+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 10:56AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>....LotR is one heck of a precedent too.

And I've definitely had at least two players specifically tell me they had never read Lord of the Rings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think it's something deeper. Of course probably most players have been exposed to a lot of the children's fantasy. And plenty of movies are grounded in fantasy tropes (including may so-called science fiction movies - Star Wars being a great example). I don't think I've ever gamed with someone who hadn't seen Star Wars.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think it goes back to the core of the fantasy tropes, especially the clear "good vs. evil." But I think it's also layered with more complex bits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for me, the fact that fantasy allows me a greater range of things I can do with the game and not break suspension of disbelief is important. Magic just winds up being lots of fun to use (from spell casters affecting combat, to magical explanations for geography, architecture, and situation). In fact, Star Wars is useful to consider in this light. We don't question what the force can do (because the fantasy tropes make us accept the force as "magic"). We don't question the space ships maneuvering in space like they were in atmosphere. And episodes I-III showed us that delving into the logic behind a fantasy element often breaks suspension of disbelief (mitocholorians? What BS!). Those explanations often killed the appeal of SF games (consider all the complaints about the size of computers in Traveller).<br/>\n<br/>\nSF of course has a particular problem that often a few years of technological advance and scientific discovery blows a big hole in some very visible part of the game setting (oops, computers can be worn on the wrist, oops, cloning isn't quite so simple as we thought, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
