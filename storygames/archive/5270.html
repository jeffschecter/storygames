But each move also <i>destroys</i>, by breaking up the empty space that the board started with into arrangements and patterns.  The entire journey of the game is from open (fascinating!) empty space into increasingly immobile positions.  The game, itself, tells you when the game is over.  You literally run out of possible and interesting moves.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow ... Ticket To Ride:  Same thing happens, as the map of (in my case) Europe fills with railway lines.  You start to lose the ability to do things that, earlier, would have been easy.  Players are dependent upon each others actions, because of these side-effects.  But part of what makes TTR an easy, challenging (but not brain-wracking) game is that the positions are not symmetrical.  Players don't interfere with each other because they're pursuing the SAME goal ... but rather, because they're pursuing different goals in a cramped space.  They most often screw each other over as a side-effect of something completely unrelated ... like, "I have to get from Pamplona to Moskva, so I've -GOT- to build the long ferry to Smyrna ... oh, that totally bolloxed your plans to get from Edinburgh to Athina?  Well ... uh ... tough cookies!"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's got me taking a good long look at how (and why) players positions are so often either independent or dependent in symmetrical ways:  Like, "Ah, you got the fan-mail that Linus can give out this scene ... I wanted that fanmail!" is symmetric, whereas "Ah, Linus gave you a benny point of which he can give an unlimited amount, so it impacts my chances for a benny point not at all" is independent.  And both, I think, are for some purposes inferior to "Linus laid down the five of hearts in support of your hearts, but that blocks my ability to play the five of spades and complete my strait ... dammit!" which is dependent but asymmetric.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118843/#Comment_118843" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T13:23:17+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  1:23PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>And both, I think, are for some purposes inferior to "Linus laid down the five of hearts in support of your hearts, but that blocks my ability to play the five of spades and complete my strait ... dammit!" which is dependent but asymmetric.</blockquote>\nInteresting.  Another idea of this "dependent but asymmetric" would be a game (or a rules hack) which says, in games where you write down relationships with NPCs, that once you take an NPC to have a relationship, no one else may choose that NPC as a relationship. Doesn't sound very risky, but imagine a game where everyone decides on a limited cast as the focus of the campaign: "The Justice League of Malta has a number of members equal to the number of PCs, plus three".<br><br>Or if one player takes a Feat (or special ability, etc) then it is disallowed by other PCs. Or not to that level. I've got something like that in this Ghost Killers claptrap, but an actual example would be like, "Once your Solar Exalted takes a "level 4" or higher ability in one charm path, no other PC can rise past level 3 in that path".<br><br>I dig that kind of thing, as it promotes... what... diversity and all that.  I can see where you're looking at applying it to story elements somehow as well, and I can kinda grasp at that but would love to see some more imaginary examples of this dependent but asymmetric style.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118860/#Comment_118860" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T15:00:52+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  3:00PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hmph.</p>\n<p>This sounds decidedly like something that I'm wrestling with for <em>Fracked</em>, my immensely-overdue gift for GBSteve over on Knife Fight.</p>\n<p>I'm basing Fracked on a stops card game, and I think there are similarities, procedurally.</p>\n<p>I wonder what happens if (for instance) individual cards become tied to individual <em>things</em>, such as situation elements, or character effectiveness...</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118861/#Comment_118861" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T15:07:47+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  3:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a horribly watered-down and mangled version of applying the TTR method to RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a map of situations a character can be in:  Happy, sad, hunted, betrayed, betraying, glorified, etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are quirky and often nonsensical links from one state to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach person, in turn, puts a token on a link (whether from their ending state in their prior scene, or from a state that they were in (flashback) or will be in (flashforward)).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?  Because each person has a randomly selected journey that they're trying to make a continous line of tokens for:  From riches to contentment ... doesn't matter if you go by way of sadness, poverty, resentment, bitterness, love, loss and redemption on the way ... in fact, please do!<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT!  Once a player puts a token on a link, no other player may put a token on that link.  So if you wanted to go from resentment to bitterness, and Jessie beats you to it, then you need to find another path for your character to get from (say) simple virtue to extravagant glory.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, a brain-hurtingly wrong and oversimplified description of some of the stuff TTR does so well, but I didn't want a post a mile long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118982/#Comment_118982" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T11:36:27+00:00" title="January 10, 2008 11:36AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2008 11:38AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the denial of resources impact somehow organic to the concept of inter-dependence that you're looking at here, or does that just happen that the examples are all coming out that way. <br>\n<br>\nAs a counter-example, in some games, when Player A makes a move good for him, this opens up new opportunities for Player B.

That is, as in the quintessential example you give of GO, every move is made to a player's relative advantage. Key to note the "relative" there, because it's actually the best play in certain cases to hurt yourself in order to disadvantage your opponent more. But when these plays are made, they create a situation that now varies in terms of the now present optimum moves for the next player. <br>\n<br>\nSpatial games lend themselves to this, because there are usually multiple dimensions which are affected by each move (usually two, but sometimes three or more). And with multiple pieces, this means that there are more interactions to consider in coming up with the optimal next move. Hence why Go and Chess are so good in this regard. <br>\n<br>\nEver play "Feudal" (an old bookcase game)? In that game you move all of your pieces each turn. This makes each turn very complex in terms of number of potential moves possible. What's fun is that the movements of the individual pieces are not quite so complex one by one. It's only the combination of individual moves that causes the complexity to arise in terms of the overall choice of "move" for the turn. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess what I'm saying is that to create better complexity in terms of "board position" you need to have multiple dimensions of choices for each choice, and you want to have multiple choices made in conjunction with each other. This creates a complexity in the resulting board position that cannot help but create the inter-player dynamic that I think you're looking for. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese "dimensions" don't have to be actual spatial dimensions, of course. They could be two or more ratings, for instance, that interact with each other (and with those of other players, of course). Multiple "pieces" could be having several sets of these ratings that are all in play simultaneously. That's a vague example, I know, but I think it gets the idea across? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal bias is that I find that most RPGs tend to have far too little complexity in regards to some of these things. In many cases the optimum strategies stare you straight in the face. It's known that chess and go both have optimum solutions - if these solutions were known, you could play according to the perfect plan, and win every time. But they are so complex that, in fact, the best computers in the world have not to date been able to calculate what those solutions are. Much less would a human be able to memorize every permutation of move and countermove. So even if you create an interaction with an optimum strategy, if you make the play complex enough, it may never become known.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Having the optimum strategy known is a problem, of course, because then every player simply uses that, and there are no choices for the player to make. I strongly suspect that the rules for The Riddle of Steel combat system have an optimum strategy, and one that shouldn't be too hard to discern, but I don't know that anyone - even Jake Norwood - has discerned it yet. The Riddle, in that aspect, has yet to be solved.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, in most RPGs, the solutions are blazingly obvious. For instance, with any ablative HP combat system the general winning strategy (all else being equal), is to gang up on individual opponents. This is how in World of Warcraft, for instance, a group of five players can have their characters take out five opposing characters of superior firepower and hits. The artificial intelligence has a method for somewhat simulating this strategy - called colloquially "Aggro" for how much an individual character aggravates the opponents and causes himself to be attacked - but it's generally inferior to human co-operation. So before any such attack, you see every group do the same planning (kill the guy marked with the skull icon, then the guy with the X). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother optimum strategy is to keep the opponents who you are not beating on out of the fight as long as possible. Foremost you don't alert them to your presence in the first place, if you can, so you can fight them one at a time (or as few as possible). Where that's not possible, you use spells or other abilities that put those characters out of commission temporarily. These are acknowledged to be so powerful as abilities, in fact, that the game system had to be altered so that in PVP combat that they had lesser durations. They still dominate however (my mage can freeze characters in place and blast them from range... warriors have no defense agains this, generally - rogues can stun opponents with surprise attacks, and then attack them unhindered, etc). <br/>\n<br/>\nEven more simply, always try to outnumber your foes. <br/>\n<br/>\nCould these strategies be any more obvious? This is hardly chess, it's not even as complex as the strategy for a good wargame. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the argument that I've heard in opposition to this is that the situations of RPG play vary enough that these bring in subtle alterations of the odds such that the "real" challenge is in dealing with each unique situation. And, while I agree that this is possible, in many cases there's no mechanical handling of these situational effects. Or, if there are, it's a simple matter of determining what the situational effect is (often by trial and error), and adjusting. When the PCs discern that there is ice on the floor in the cave, they attempt to eliminate the slipperyness with a fireball or by fashioning cleats or something. At best this becomes a test of player ingenuity, and often how well they can chide the GM into accepting that they can make cleats out of their boots and the cutlery they have in their pack. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is another general problem that I have with the nature of these things... often they are left subjective, and the "winning move" is not a matter of adjusting an objective board position or such, but instead of social manipulation of the GM. So, sans mechanical description, I don't find the ice example to be particularly a good test of player acumen. <br/>\n<br/>\nWorse, it rarely ever does anything in terms of the sort of interactivity that you're looking for. It's completely like your bennie example in that as a move it doesn't alter my subsequent choices at all if you come into battle on cleats, having eliminated the ice penalty. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, the ice gets some rating with multiple dimensions, and the question of how the character deals with it is one of how he decides to adjust one of his multiple ratings - those ratings mechanically being interdependent with those of the oppositions - now we potentially have something tactically interesting and where player decisions will mechanically affect the "board position" and thus the participant interactions. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust one lame example, there are probably myriad ways to accomplish this, including many that do not require a map to accomplish. That said, I recall a couple of designs out there have mechanics dealing with relationship maps or other such more abstract structures, which might work well for this sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
