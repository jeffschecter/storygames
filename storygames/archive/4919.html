Only trufans are reading now, right?<br/><br/>So my Wednesday group is trying Spirit of the Century for the first time.  Last night was devoted to character generation.  I've read SOTC, and played a convention one-shot, but in the back of my mind I've been a little hesitant.  It's everybody's darling so it can't <i>really </i>be great, can it?  Can it?<br/><br/>Character creation:<br/><br/>... is a group affair, and a sort of game in itself<br/>... involves the creation of explicit flags<br/>... guides characters into fun niches and protects them there<br/>... involves characters in each other's back stories (and encourages character-to-character flags)<br/>... has a satisfying degree of crunchy decision-making<br/><br/>So as a preparatory activity with an eye toward play, it's the bee's knees.  How am I going to intertwine "Digger" Watkins, the Pennsylvania Mole Man, with Princess Anastasia Romanova, on the run across Europe with a Gypsy caravan, hunted by Soviet assassins?  How will I tune my stunts so that I can trick out the Electrical Mole Car?  Why are we not playing yet?<br/><br/>Which leads to the only potential hitch in the whole process - it takes a lot of time.  But it's fun, social time, and by the end of it we had a really crazy cast of pulp ne'er-do-wells and were itching to play.  It's noteworthy that my brother stumbled in an hour and a half late and we got him up to speed and into the mix with no trouble.  <br/><br/>I know all this is not news to you trufans, but I was really impressed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110246/#Comment_110246" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T07:05:18+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  7:05AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found the character creation/story creation process in SotC really is a game session unto itself. You can do it more quickly by starting your characters off with fewer Aspects and then developing new ones in-game. Instead of saying you are guest-starring in another PCs novel, this is the novel you all are co-starring in. This gives more chances to create intertwined Aspects between characters, I feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had a few players who really prefer to take the books home, pour over them and create their character/s in solitude. The more social aspect of SotC seems kinda daunting to them. I think it has more to do with the min/max aspect of a lot of other RPG character creation; they don't want to make a decision at the table that doesn't give them the maximum advantage, at least in their mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110252/#Comment_110252" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T07:24:33+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  7:24AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've also done a couple of things with SotC "shared novels".

We also made the setting, a noir-ish city, a major character in the last novel of a recent small cast.<br/><br/>And then for my Eberron/SotC mish-mash...we called them "Modules" just to have fun, and patterned those adventures around  old skool d&amp;d monochromatic products...although, inserting some Eberron color into it.<br/><br/>I love the novel process of the Chargen of SotC.

I was just wondering last night how I would convert some of my old D&amp;D characters using SotC, and one idea was to do them as staring in their own fantasy novels, like the Fritz Lieber books or Forgotten Realm novels.

There's a reason we don't say you must select your skills and stunts during the background creation part -- it's meant to be friendly to the choose-my-skills-and-stunts-at-home set, if they want it.<br/><br/>That said, if that's truly their concern, make certain it's clearly said to everyone at the table that in the first few sessions of play, folks can change their skill and stunt picks at any time, and it's *always* allowed between sessions.  SOTC doesn't demand that you get it right the first time.  It *does* demand that you seek out your most fun character implementation and change to *be* that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110380/#Comment_110380" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:04:23+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:04PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: oliof</cite>I like to demo SotC by doing a fully fledged group character generation and then showing people what kind of adventures I'd develop from that.</blockquote>\nHonestly, I think that'd be a great 2 or 3 or 4-hour convention slot sort of thing.

It turns out SOTC character creation makes for an interesting sort of party game -- a social "scavenging hunt".  One of the players decided to create a villain to intertwine with everyone else's backstories.  It was pretty hot, all told, and it meant that everyone was entertained for hours on end while we signed and signed and signed.<br/><br/>I still have the character list up on my whiteboard.

You don't need all of the PC's aspects at your fingertips -- just a small subsection (say, 2, maybe 3) for each one that you think will warrant strong/frequent compels.  <br/><br/>Stunts' effects should definitely be written on character sheets if you can manage it when prepping -- avoid the need to go heads-down and reference the book.  Heads-up gaming is where it's at.<br/><br/>NPCs should only be detailed inasmuch as you need them to be -- think 'characters on the fly', here.  A few peak skills, one or two aspects, a few stunt effects if warranted, that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111218/#Comment_111218" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T23:58:27+00:00" title="December  2, 2007 11:58PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2007 11:59PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>I should take this opportunity to say thanks again to Ryan Macklin for running a short-form game of SotC at Gen Con for me and a few other folks- that was my first experience with it, and as I prepare to run it I regularly think back to how well Ryan wrangled (or ignored) rules in order to make sure we kept moving and having fun.

Steve set up a pair of broad conflicts - one was a big-ass fight in a Washington, DC speakeasy, and the other was a hostage-taking at a fancy dress ball at the British Museum.  We were feeling our way with an unfamiliar system and we were just trying to showcase the system and get our bearings. These are my initial impressions.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the sheer number of moving parts - my head was spinning.  I offer a compel, I block, I maneuver, that gets me a +2 or some other thing, I re-roll, how does that stunt work, I create an aspect but it is only temporary, now it's gone, that's an assessment, consult book, no you can't use that skill to assess, it was a lot to take in.  <br/><br/>We were all shocked at how hard it is to <i>impact</i>another character.  Like, we worked our <i>asses </i>off to create a minor consequence for this KKK goon.  And it was a minor consequence!  Three more to go before he's down for good unless we accept his concessions.  It took three of us all focusing on this one guy to bring him down, and even then I think Steve just gave up.  <br/><br/>I had a huge hippie disconnect with the fact that I'm not able to author anything.  Or rather, I can author steel beams falling from the ceiling but I can't author the contents of a dude's pocket, or his motivation. <br/><br/>We had many situations where contestants tied rolls, and nothing about the situation changed.  One time I climbed across some girders and dropped on a guy like a spider monkey!  Tied roll after I used all applicable aspects, nothing changed.  <br/><br/>Maybe we were using compels wrong, but they didn't seem particularly engaging.  Under what circumstances would I <i>not </i>want to make things more, rather than less, interesting?  Nobody refused a compel, and we all offered up a bunch ourselves.  I wanted a way to compel other player characters, which mechanically makes no sense.  <br/><br/>My guy has "Afraid of the Dark" as an aspect.  Steve compelled it in the speakeasy fight, and bang!  The lights went out!  Awesome!  And I didn't really know what to do.  I couldn't connect that to the game in any meaningful way - so was I supposed to have him quake in fear?  There was no interface with the system other than me getting a reward for agreeing that the lights should go off.  I decided a mechanic who was scared of the dark probably carried a light source out of habit, and he turned on a carbon arc lamp, so we were back where we started before the compel.<br/><br/>So it went a little rough for me.  I did get to drive the Mole Car through a wall as my impromptu sonic weapon gadget screeched "Rule Brittania", though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112273/#Comment_112273" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T06:32:48+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  6:32AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, we were doing some things wrong, not the least of which was trying to pay too much attention to the more detailed rules.

But games since then get better each time, so I think it's just a matter of getting more familiar with the rules.

This helps alleviate the whiff factor.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite> <br/>My guy has "Afraid of the Dark" as an aspect. Steve compelled it in the speakeasy fight, and bang!

There was no interface with the system other than me getting a reward for agreeing that the lights should go off.

Until the lights came back on, the bad guys would be tagging the 'darkness' scene aspect to gain a +2 in rolls against your character.

The ones provided are examples of what you can do with the system, not a list of restricted actions.<br/><br/>EDIT: And I have it slightly wrong. The bit about tagging an aspect to do a skill sub is on page 81 (Using the Environment). The example is using Athletics to make an attack by tagging the "Traps" aspect in the tombs. So that's a "regular" rule.<br/><br/>The Might thing I was thinking of was doing a <i>maneuver</i> for a skill substitution. That's mentioned on page 103 (Fighting People) and nowhere else. But it's applicable to any skill. Do a successful maneuver action first, then use a skill for something else.<br/><br/>So, there are two ways to do a skill sub. You can do it immediately by tagging (and pay a Fate point) or you can set it up by first doing a maneuver.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112638/#Comment_112638" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T04:27:47+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  4:27AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Like, "Your ass is all beat up.

As a player I can compel the GM? Why would he care about getting a fate point?</blockquote>\nAs a player, you can spend a fate point to tag another character's aspect for effect - effectively, putting a compel on that character. It could be another PC or an NPC. If it's an NPC controlled by the GM, they can work the process just like you can - the GM can give you a fate point to say, "Nope, that NPC's not going to run away," or let you spend it and make it so. If it's a named NPC, and not just a mook, that NPC would get a fate point.<br/><br/>When I run it, I'm strict about the fate point totals of named NPCs - they participate in the invoke/compel economy just like PCs. When they're out, I don't give them any more. Minions never get any, unless they gain one from a tag in the middle of a conflict. Strictly speaking, then, I care about getting the fate point if that character needs fate points. Generally speaking, I care about the opportunity for structured Drama resolution that compels provide.<br/><br/>Also, you can use skills to make declarations as well, as per the "Assessments and Declarations" rules. You don't always have to spend a fate point for it. I don't see why that wouldn't extend to using something like Empathy to say, "I'm guessing this person is motivated by deep self-loathing." I'd take that offer, possibly even in contradiction to my notes.<br/><br/>Conflicts between named characters can take some time, and it's pretty much everybody's love/hate thing: I know folks who are totally about the hour-long setpiece, and I know folks who consider the system broken because of this. The trick is to focus on stacking free tags through maneuvers, so it's ultimately better to, say, set the room On Fire and get your opponent Cornered before you do an attack, because then you can rack up the +4 when you attack.

I (jokingly) consider it the defining criterion for a 'real' SotC session.<br/><br/>Jason, the example you gave for the way your "Afraid of the Dark" Aspect was compelled is very... interesting to me.  I confess it never would have occurred to me to use it that way, as the GM, and I'm not sure I would, even now that I've seen an example.<br/><br/>To test my understanding:<br/><br/><b>What you did:</b><br/>GM: Hey, you have "Afraid of the Dark" -- I'll give you a Fate point if I can have the power go out in this room and cast everything into Darkness.<br/>You: ... Okay.<br/><br/>Is that right? If it isn't, correct me, but if it is, just nod. I'll get it.<br/><br/><b>What I would have expected in my play group:</b><br/>GM: Okay, the thugs cut the power to the ballroom.  The environmental aspects on this conflict are "Crowded with Panicky Debutantes" and "Pitch Black."<br/>Player 1: Oy.<br/>GM: Player 2, you have "Afraid of the Dark" as an Aspect. *dangles Fate chip* I'll give you this shiny Fate point if you waste a couple rounds rummaging frantically through your stuff, trying to find a way to make some light.<br/>Player 2: A couple rounds? Umm... hmm.  Two rounds?<br/>GM: For one point, yeah.<br/>Player 2: One round rummaging and the next round I can kill that Darkness Aspect?<br/>GM: Yup.<br/>Player: Deal!<br/><br/>In short, I don't usually --<br/><br/>Hmm. I just thought, though, that if someone had "Damn those Mole Men!" as an Aspect, I would totally pay them a Fate Point if I brought them in.  Hmm.  So I guess it's not THAT weird...

I prefer the implementation we talk about on our wiki: a basis of 3 stress boxes instead of 5, and the "-2/-4/-6 consequences" rule.   <a href="http://evilhat.wikidot.com/faster-conflicts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://evilhat.wikidot.com/faster-conflicts</a> for more.<br/><br/>- We had a prohibition in the rules against stacking free tags.  That's dumb.  If you can set up a bunch of temporary aspects with free tags on 'em, hit it!  Use 'em all!<br/><br/>- Story-gamers take note: John's right that it's sort of a "hidden" feature in SOTC that every skill can be used to make Declarations.  Look to the Skills chapter for the section on Assessments and Declarations.  Here's behind the curtain: Assessments are for groups that are more comfortable with the GM coming up with stuff on the fly.  Declarations are for groups that want the players to come up with stuff on the fly.  So feel free to adapt the Declaration method to every skill you can figure something out for.  Say, you're playing a martial artist with a strong Fists skill.  Use the Fists skill to Declare that the other guy's Kung Fu has a weakness in its technique.  The other guy defends with his Fists; if you succeed, your fact is true, and manifests as an aspect on him!    Note that this is almost EXACTLY like a combat maneuver ("I sweep his legs out from under him, giving him an On His Back aspect!") only with the cognitive shift to creating new facts instead of taking actions.  Which is the *real* secret behind it all -- Assessment, Declaration, and Maneuver are all the same basic action in the system: use your skill to assert authority over the world, which will manifest as a temporary aspect; the only difference between them is how the scope of your authority is perceived.  With assessments, the GM retains authority to create new facts about the world; with declarations, the Player has authority to create new facts about the world; with maneuvers, the action takes place within the context of already-established facts.  <i>That's it.</i><br/><br/>As to the first two items, well, that's what happens when you don't have hundreds of people playtesting your game before you release it. <br/><br/>As to the last one -- we're trying to present rules in a way that doesn't threaten the "traditional gamer" too much right out of the box, so that stuff ended up a little more disguised than, perhaps, it should've been.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112825/#Comment_112825" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T12:58:39+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 12:58PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2007 12:33AM by nemomeme.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a similar reaction as Doyce when reading about the "Afriad of the Dark" Aspect Compel.  The rules are pretty clear that the character has to be inhibited or have their lives made more complicated by the Compel, so that would naturally include some description of how that was going to go down in the negotiation.  You wouldn't just Compel to have the lights go out, you'd Compel to have the lights go out with *these* effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I tend to have a default of having characters be delayed by 1 round by accepting a Compel like "Afraid of the Dark".  This gets them back into the conflict more quickly and fits the economy of the game well in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) A successful Maneuver (which took a character 1 "turn"/Exchange) = Fragile Aspect on opposition = +2 to future roll against that opponent by that character (or passed off to a buddy).<br/>\n2) An accepted Compel to delay or restrict a character 1 turn = a Fate Point = a future +2 however they want to use it, given an appropriate Aspect to tag, internal or external.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to get creative with this and have lots of different kinds of restrictions/complications/mandated actions with Compels, but that's the default economy I've internalized and put into play.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Compel in this scenario  becomes, "Hey, you know that cool quirk your character has?  I'll give you the equivalent of an automatically successful Maneuver that you can put into play more flexibly if you cool your heels for an exchange, and it will make the scene more colorful in a context that really fits with the character choices you've made."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112826/#Comment_112826" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T13:03:08+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  1:03PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Thanks, Lenny, that's helpful.</blockquote>\nLet me say something else that might be helpful, re: conflicts.<br/><br/>So, you know how you do combat in a lot of "trad" systems, and you have this chart in the combat section that's a bunch of positional modifiers? "Target is prone" or "target is moving faster than 1m a round" or "target is on high ground" or "target is under 1/2 cover". Right? And you try and rack up as many of those as you can so that you have a lot of bonuses to your attacks.<br/><br/>In SotC, that's what maneuvers are for, it's just that there's no chart - you make up the situational modifiers yourself as you go along. That's why it's not very Gamist-supporting: you don't strategize to put yourself in the best position, you roll to make it true that the position you're in is the best one. But the transcript often comes out the same - it's always, "I dove behind cover, I shot the gas tank to set the room on fire, and used the distraction and my good position to take the bad guy down." It's just that in SotC, the mechanical process of making that happen is precisely backwards from what it is in, say, GURPS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112836/#Comment_112836" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T13:36:55+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  1:36PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2007 1:37PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Which is the *real* secret behind it all -- Assessment, Declaration, and Maneuver are all the same basic action in the system: use your skill to assert authority over the world, which will manifest as a temporary aspect; the only difference between them is how the scope of your authority is perceived.

I think part of my confusion is the variety of "extra" rules in the book that at first glance seem like "drift".  This summary helps put those rules into context a bit.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite><br/>As a player, you can spend a fate point to tag another character's aspect for effect - effectively, putting a compel on that character. It could be another PC or an NPC. If it's an NPC controlled by the GM, they can work the process just like you can - the GM can give you a fate point to say, "Nope, that NPC's not going to run away," or let you spend it and make it so. If it's a named NPC, and not just a mook, that NPC would get a fate point.</blockquote>\nThis bit still seems like crazy-talk to me- why wouldn't players try this all the time?

Every time a player does this, they either get their way (the bad guy runs away) or they get a Fate point.</blockquote>\nCompels are subject to GM veto (or as I prefer to call it in my hippie ways, "group veto") before you start the process, so it doesn't work as a cheap out in conflicts. Justification is the important bit - if it's an entertaining, cool suggestion, I don't think handing a person a fate point when they do it is a bad thing. It says you recognize their contribution was cool, even if you don't go for it.<br/><br/>If it's a cheap way for you to shortcut conflicts, I will give you that look that says you are lame. But you will still get the free tag as per normal conflict rules.<br/><br/>Edit: Though, if you're really worried about it, you can also say that when you tag for effect, the fate point is just spent - your involvement ends when the GM takes it from there and runs the compel with the target. So you lose a fate point whenever you tag for effect, and hence, only want to do it when you're pretty damn sure the GM will run with it, or if you just want to cost your opponent some fate points. I don't run it this way, but I can see where that might be a preferred approach for some groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112847/#Comment_112847" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T14:01:11+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  2:01PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...compels are definitely a GM-only tool via the book.

That's dumb.  If you can set up a bunch of temporary aspects with free tags on 'em, hit it!  Use 'em all!<br/></blockquote>\nWe found some places in our hackery where stacking free tags actually doesn't work very well so now we're torn between prohibiting them or putting special restrictions in place.  I hate special restrictions but I love stacked free tags.  Such a conundrum!<br/><br/>The example that came up first was making a Credits check to buy something very expensive.  All the low Credits (Wealth, Resources, Whatever) can do a maneuver to try and put a free-taggable aspect on the purchase and then the high Credits character buys it with all the free tags.  So basically we have everyone chipping in a quarter so one guy can buy a yacht.  This problem arises because the whole wealth abstraction doesn't work at all on a linear scale and the free tags stacking don't work at all on a geometric scale (where the abstraction is of a concrete quantity that doubles or more per rank).  I still don't know if this is a highly specific problem, a general problem, or a non-problem, but I'm working on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Wealth abstraction is one of the inscrutable hells of TRPG design.<br/><br/>Though, I'd be curious to know what you set the maneuver difficulty at, for such an expensive object. If you're talking about a Superb difficulty or higher, say, and a bunch of PC's have Fair or lower Resources, you're probably going to be spending fate points just to pull that maneuver off - in which case, the endeavor might not even be worth it to the rest of the group. And even then, there's no guarantee they'll have enough relevant aspects to contribute for everyone to make it - a character who has a lot of money-related aspects probably already has a high Resources.<br/><br/>In my games where Resources use comes up, everything has usually come out in the wash via narration, and maybe I've been lucky in that regard. Say you have a character who wants to help contribute to the purchase of a Epic (+7)-difficulty yacht. He has a Resources of Average (+1) - no property owner, but he's not exactly stressing out about not having enough ramen in the cupboards, either. He tries the maneuver and rolls a +4, and invokes an aspect called [Maroni Bigbucks Owes Me] to make the +2, and lo, he gets the +7 and hands the tag over to the guy with Superb Resources.<br/><br/>What just happened there? Clearly, this Bigbucks guy contributed a significant of cash to the deal - the poor guy's significant contribution was in calling in the debt, not providing a large amount from his own funds. So, that shakes out in narration and makes sense.<br/><br/>So, suppose you have a dude with Good (+3) Resources, and he actually makes the roll naturally. What just happened there? Probably, that character just handed over a significant portion or all of his savings to help contribute to the deal, or at least to the down payment on the loan for the yacht. At Good level, a character can afford to buy something like a truck or a motorcycle according to the little chart, so it's not inconceivable that he could come up with enough cash to be helpful somehow.<br/><br/>So really, I think the assisting maneuvers for Resources use track pretty well - where *my* issue with the inscrutable hell comes in has to do with ablation. You've got an upper middle-class guy who just blew a ton of cash to help out with a purchase of a really expensive thing. But his skill level doesn't change any. He could, if he wanted to, continue trying to buy stuff for the rest of the session at Good, once per scene. <br/><br/>Aside from the fact that anyone who spends a whole gaming session trying to buy stuff should be slapped repeatedly across the face with a large mackerel, this doesn't really track very well.* There comes a point where you have to make pretty large leaps in order to justify that kind of thing, if the financial status of your characters is an important part of the game.<br/><br/>SotC has that problem precisely because that kind of thing isn't really an important part of the game, unless you have high Resources, in which case you've subverted the issue anyway. The Century Club lets everyone operate at around Fair Resources most of the time, and probably will go higher in times of dire need, and for them, money is no object.<br/><br/>If you're doing a hacked game where it is important, like something fantasy or cyberpunk or whatever, I'd seriously consider making Financial a stress track on the characters, so they can suffer consequences like [Really Nasty Debt] or [Owes a Crimeboss] or whatever.<br/><br/>[* - This sentence is mostly a joke.

Steve compelled it in the speakeasy fight, and bang!  The lights went out!  Awesome!  And I didn't really know what to do.  I couldn't connect that to the game in any meaningful way - so was I supposed to have him quake in fear?  There was no interface with the system other than me getting a reward for agreeing that the lights should go off.  I decided a mechanic who was scared of the dark probably carried a light source out of habit, and he turned on a carbon arc lamp, so we were back where we started before the compel.<br/></blockquote>\nJason, my understanding of the purpose of a compel is to add interesting complications to the story. I think the arc lamp effectively denied the compel. Like blocking in improv (or what I understand blocking to be). The lights went out, but they didn't really add an <i>interesting </i>complication.<br/><br/>I can see lots of interesting things that could have come from your fear. You might have a taggable "absolutely terrified" aspect. You might abandon your friends in search of an exit. You might get so freaked out that you light the place on fire trying to get more light. Now we have new scene aspects: "Fire!" and "Blinding smoke". I agree with Doyce and Matthew that the compel should have been more directed to the impact it had on your character and the narrative, rather than just the change in environment.  Of course, its hard sometimes to do that at the table. In your situation, I would have aked everyone if they had any ideas for a cool complication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112956/#Comment_112956" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T07:04:03+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  7:04AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I agree James, and I suspect we'll do it better in the future.

I'm still trying to explain to one of my guys that taking "interdimensional demon monkeys" is cooler by many orders of magnitude than "I can handle this!" Some of this is a trust/habit issue: "interdimensional demon monkeys" sounds so specific that it can't possibly be useful, while as a GM I'm desperate for story aspects to toss around, compel, etc. And there's selling them on the basic premise that authorial ownership = awesome. <br/><br/>* Naturally my mecha-fetishist wants to play a Tony Stark-like character. No idea how to spec out a personal gadget that's an armored suit. Actually...we have too many correct ways of getting there, and that was itself a problem (as it often is with these games -- "many correct mechanical answers to mechanical questions" is on my list of indie sacred cows worth poking at). It was, in fact, a three hour problem.<br/><br/>* We're still feeling our way through using aspects to temporarily/permanently change one's default attack/defense skill in a conflict. On a related note, I'm not totally clear on how many things an aspect can do for you. I'm assume one "thing" per invoke/tag -- produce an effect, make a declaration, get a +2 or a reroll, change a skill. Can you change a skill with a tag, or does it take a maneuver? Or do you use a maneuver to temporarily create the aspect that you can then tag to change your skill?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112982/#Comment_112982" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T11:05:57+00:00" title="December  8, 2007 11:05AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Fate-management, remind them that there are ways to get Fate points back so if they are a concern, go there.

The effects of a compel seem...looser...than this in the RAW (and in fact I see you address this looseness in the zero-sum rules). In actual play have you found that the loss of an exchange is suitable? I'd imagine you'd have to have a different baseline when you're outside "conflict time."<br/><br/>I'm strongly considering going over to the zero-sum model and allow characters to compel one another. The only weirdness I foresee if compelling someone's aspect in a way that isn't directly beneficial to anyone, and/or dealing with aspects that can't be compelled for anyone's benefit.

It's a negotiation anyway, so ask for whatever you want and the player can say yes, no, or bargain you up.<br/><br/>If a compel doesn't benefit anyone (including the story -- that's when the GM gets one) it's not worth paying for.  Zero sum is sharper in a wargaming context where story isn't really paid, per se, so the GM has fate points per entity in the fight and they get paid appropriately.  In the RPG the GM probably has his own stack to divvy up between NPCs and such, so he gets paid for anything ambiguous.  But keep it important -- if there's no clear benefit to pay for, don't bother.  If the PCs just need fate points without story reasons, consider just giving them some -- sometimes we all agree that we started with too few.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112999/#Comment_112999" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T11:58:07+00:00" title="December  8, 2007 11:58AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>* It's very easy to hook into the Fate-management game, to the detriment of hooking into the making-awesome-narrative game.

Technically speaking, if somebody spends a fate point on a tag, the character for whom that tag is a detriment gets a fate point next exchange. (Meaning, it doesn't happen when the tag is free.) You can use this to funnel FPs back to the players during a conflict. Often in my games, when players blow fate points on tagging early in a conflict, they end up receiving them back when the bad guys tag back, which gets them through the last part of the fight.<br/><br/>In case you're worried about this creating a zero-sum game in a bad way, I've also played it where the fate points come back at the end of the conflict. So, as the bad guys tag stuff, you tally it up on a piece of paper, and then at the end of the conflict, it's like getting a small recharge.<br/><br/>I've also played it where you hand characters fate points for losing a conflict - one for losing, plus one per consequence they took.\n<blockquote>* Situation-heavy aspects are a very easy trap to fall into, particularly with the old-skool tactical players who want a versatile toolbox at their fingertips. I'm still trying to explain to one of my guys that taking "interdimensional demon monkeys" is cooler by many orders of magnitude than "I can handle this!"</blockquote>\nBe firm about aspects having a double-edge nature to them; explain that aspects that are only broadly useful in one direction are not good as a source of fate points, and hence not tactically optimal.<br/><br/>For example, suggest rephrasing the above as  "I <i>think</i> I can handle this!" Small change and you still get all the benefits, but now there's a compel option for walking headlong into overwhelming odds with that overconfidence, or choosing to do stuff alone that the character really might need help on.\n<blockquote>* No idea how to spec out a personal gadget that's an armored suit.</blockquote>\nWell, if it's Tony Stark's suit, it grants extra strength, flight, and energy blasts, right? Peak the character out with Engineering, and give him a Great Guns skill. Starting with the basic three improvements, we give it the ability to do flight (like Jet Black's backpack) (Additional Capability), the ability to swap Engineering for Might while wearing the suit (Alternate Usage), and an energy cannon, so the character can use his Guns skill without needing an actual gun (Armed).<br/><br/>Take the Personal Gadget stunt a second time,  and add another Alternate Usage that while wearing the suit, the character can use Engineering like Endurance, and hence his stress track in the suit is 8. You spend the last two on the Unbelievable improvement (which I'd make a requirement, 'cause Good Lord) and on Craftsmanship for a +1 to either the Might effect or to flying.<br/><br/>And there you have it. You are now Iron Man. Here's the thing about gadgets: what they are to begin with is less important than what they do. The thing I didn't do was start by going, "How do I represent a baseline armored suit in the system?" That doesn't matter. All that matters is that you get the appropriate functions down.\n<blockquote>* Can you change a skill with a tag</blockquote>\nFor a single roll? Sure. Say you're Sally Slick at a construction site. "I grab the controls and swing the arm of the [Giant Crane] around into the Blitz-bot that's fighting Jet." That's an attack with Engineering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113024/#Comment_113024" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T13:48:38+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  1:48PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2007 1:53PM by noclue.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Yes, I agree James, and I suspect we'll do it better in the future.

It was just to point out that the compel is only useful if it adds interesting complications. If the GM brings up a compel and you can't see anything interesting coming out of it, you should feel free to say "How's that interesting?" and if he doesn't say something cool you can even buy off the compel. Then the GM can throw down another fate point and go "Well, how about if we add blah blah blah to it? Is that awesome enough?"<br/><br/>Oh, and about the being useful thing. Sometimes, its more fun to be the source of difficulties. There's this reaction that I had when I first saw a compel in a game, where I went no way! That would really fuck up the whole plan. And then I stopped and realized how cool a fucked up plan would be. Once I saw that, I started looking for ways I could invoke my own aspects in negative but interesting ways and I stopped fighting the GM as much when he compel'd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113041/#Comment_113041" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T15:31:26+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  3:31PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2007 3:31PM by PaulB.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>Are you handing back fate points to the PCs when the bad guys do a maneuver and tag?

This is the intended default. Tagging any of your aspects that have been assessed counts, tagging your consequences counts, and tagging any temporary aspect from a maneuver that's been made sticky counts. Tagging scene aspects is more like claiming a situational modifier, and so the fate point doesn't go to anyone.<br/><br/>However, I've seen people hand the fate points out to whoever gets a detriment regardless. It doesn't break anything, it just makes people use scene aspects more often than they try to do maneuvers.<br/><br/>This makes the stickiness of a temporary aspect a pretty big deal, and it's why we recommend that you might want to require the PC to generate spin on the maneuver roll to perform one. If you throw out a maneuver like "Off Balance", well, that's probably fragile, so you'll tag it once for free and then the opponent's centered again. If you throw out a maneuver like "Disarmed", that's not a condition that automatically resolves itself - the opponent might have to use an action to make an Athletics roll to recover their weapon, or whatever. That's where you get the currency flow going, with a maneuver that sticks and allows you to get multiple uses out of it.<br/><br/>So, if you get Disarmed, three goons might tag that and you might take some stress, but next exchange, you'll have two fate points and the ability to reclaim your weapon.

But my answer is, "Definitely not."<br/><br/>Here's the fundamental dirty secret about compels: they're a Drama resolution system hidden inside a Fortune resolution system. You never combine the use of compels and the use of dice. You never go, "Okay, your enemy spills a drink on you, and you're not going to take it lying down - here's a fate point, and roll your Resolve to see if you can keep from punching him in the face." That's why the buyout option is there on a compel, because it's your only way to go, "No, I *am* taking it lying down, because there are more important things I'm worrying about. So I clench my fists and am totally angry, but I don't embarrass myself at this party."<br/><br/>Tagging has no such component, unless it's tagging for effect, which causes a compel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113050/#Comment_113050" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T16:57:19+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  4:57PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have another one, but I must offer my sincerest apologies to Jason, for stomping all over your lovely thread with my stupid questions.

I couldn't connect that to the game in any meaningful way - so was I supposed to have him quake in fear?  There was no interface with the system other than me getting a reward for agreeing that the lights should go off.  I decided a mechanic who was scared of the dark probably carried a light source out of habit, and he turned on a carbon arc lamp, so we were back where we started before the compel.</blockquote>\nThis paragraph struck me apparently, because I'm re-reading this thread and a thought occurred:  I wouldn't have done a compel like that.<br/><br/>If I had GMed with a character having this Aspect, here's what would have gone down:  First, I would have set up a situation where the PC wanted to do something, like, say, chase a down a lit mine tunnel.  Then, as he enters, the lights would have gone out.  I don't hand a Fate point over for this -- I just get to do it as typical GM fiat, just like I have some guy running down a mine tunnel rather than giving up or trying to shoot it out.<br/><br/>Now, I know you have "Afraid of the Dark" as an Aspect, but that isn't the issue.  Sure, you should be role-playing it, and that's all gravy, but beyond that there's something else I have to do before I see it as compel-worthy: I have to come up with a conflicting choice of action.  In this case, I would hold out a Fate point and say "You know, you're 'Afraid of the Dark.'  I think it's time you ran back to the surface, don't you?"  Then you either take the Fate point and do the <em>action</em> I'm compelling you with, or give me a Fate point and continue do to what you will.  If you decide to buy out of the compel, you aren't suddenly unafraid of the dark -- but you're sucking it up to be heroic.<br/><br/>All that's to say that I compel actions and reactions, not scenery effects or character feelings -- thus, compels provide direct, if undesirable, actions.  I think this is partly because I played Truth &amp; Justice before SotC, and the "revoltin' development" rules in T&amp;J have influenced how I see compels in SotC.  I also play really, really loose with the rules.

Clearly other folks have equally-valid opinions on the subject.</blockquote>\nWell, let's look at the rules for a second, in the vein of providing more helpful material to Jason and to Steve. 'Cause I did sort of help turn his thread into a flaming tangential wreck, and now I kinda feel bad. Lemme deconstruct the thing a little bit.<br/><br/>The rules say that compels essentially do two things: <i>limit choices</i> and <i>complicate situations</i>. To be a compel, that limitation or complication has to be dramatic enough to impact things. It has to <i>matter</i> in some sense.<br/><br/>So, Mole Man is [Afraid of the Dark]. The group is in the middle of a crazy fight, and I hold up a fate point and look at Jason, and then say, "Bang! You hear gunshots and the lights go out! Holy shit, it's dark in here, and there's noise, and you can't tell where anyone is all of a sudden, and how can you fight in this?"<br/><br/>The reason why this matters is because Mole Man's in here with his friends, and his friends are in danger. If he succumbs to his fear, he can't help them anymore. Note I'm not telling him what to do - I'm telling him his next choices are limited by his inability to participate in the fight. He could run away, cower uselessly, go catatonic - or something more useful even, like create a quick escape route, by digging or busting out a window. What he can't do is <i>help his friends</i>. And later, there needs to be a scene where someone goes, "Cripes, Digger, we could have freakin' used your help in there. What's the matter with you?"<br/><br/>Now, keep in mind that you totally could narrate your way out of that limitation any number of different ways. It's totally reasonable that Mole Man would carry a light source to keep this kind of thing from happening. That isn't the point. The point is, you're choosing to create a dramatic moment. The light source could totally be how you pay out to avoid the compel - "Leon starts shaking, but then he remembers his lamp and quickly flicks it on!" Or it could be grounds for the group calling that compel lame, if there's too easy of an out. <br/><br/>And when you pay out to resist a compel, it's the limitation itself that you're saying no to. So, Ryan, suppose you've got Mole Man in the dark mine tunnel. You throw out the fate point and say, "It's pitch black suddenly, and you are scared shitless. Are you sure you want to be in here?" And Jason might run away, or he might go, "You know, maybe it'll be light somewhere up ahead! I totally charge forward headlong, scared out of my mind, <i>no matter what might happen to me</i>." That's not refusing the compel, that's the player walking right into the hands of the bad guys or monsters to get captured, half-eaten, or whatever. He's still accepting that he can't be in here <i>and keep his wits about him</i>.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that you shouldn't put out the obvious suggestion. Just remember that's all it is, a suggestion, and that there's a negotiation process there for a reason, because there's more than one way to make a situation complicated and to make that complication matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113076/#Comment_113076" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T21:57:46+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  9:57PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, Lenny, got it.

During one of the adventures in the latter half of the campaign, Doom managed to beat Awesome and company to an artifact that was part of a larger ancient device that would allow someone to, you guessed it, rule the world.<br/><br/>Now, just as Awesome was about to get to the artifact (which was under the capstone of the Washington Monument), the GM held out a different-colored Fate chip and said "This is a special chip, because I'm compelling 'Curse you Doom!'"  I look at the GM, knowing that he's already telling me the artifact was already stolen before I got to steal it to protect it.  I accepted the Fate point, feeling like I didn't have a say in the matter.  In hindsight, I realized that I wasn't accepting the bribe to allow the GM to screw me over -- that was going to happen regardless.  What I did was say "Yes, you're damned right I'm pissed off and won't be thinking clearly as I chase that bastard into hell itself."<br/><br/>Only, I did all that without thinking anyway.  As soon as my airship picked me up, I immediately stormed into my quarters, barking along the way that this airship needs to be fitted with machine guns and harpoons**, and all that be done in two hours before we set off for London.  During the entire next session, I was utterly focused on bringing Doom down, even if it meant a second airship of mine that would be destroyed in this game and my crew harmed or lost with it.<br/><br/>So, the compel wasn't about that action, but was about the character's mental state that would then affect subsequent actions to come.  So, to relate this back to your comment, perhaps the compel wasn't due to the brawl, but to maybe being very shaken and wanting to leave town after realizing what the brawl meant.  Sometimes there's a sort of mental dexterity that needs to be flexed when figuring out invokes and compels. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(*That is still fun to say.)<br/>(**Seriously, airship plus harpoons.

Granted you've played story games where complicating shit starts becoming second nature, but its pretty new to me. Where I come from when you are in a gun battle and there's perfectly good cover, you make with the ducking. You wouldn't want to just stand out in the open and trade shots even if your character sheet does say "Sometimes my emotions get the better of my judgement." You just wrote that shit; you didn't really mean it.

This is a great compel.<br/><br/>The ability to reject a compel exists because struggling to overcome your limitations is an important part of many narratives. Resisting makes a statement about your character, given concrete significance by the spending of game currency.<br/><br/>You have [Afraid of the Dark]. The lights go out in the speakeasy. Your friends are in danger. You can't help them if you accept the compel. If you reject the compel and pay out, you help your friends despite your fear. It says something about your character.<br/><br/>That's why it's important to establish what the limitation is. In Ryan's last example, the real limitation was in how he'd respond emotionally to Doom's nefarious act. Well, maybe that's exactly what Doom wants, and maybe accepting the compel means you play right into his hands. Rejecting the compel means that Dick Awesome realizes what's going on, and is able to counter-plan for it. That says something about Dick Awesome, and how he's developed as a person over time. Maybe eventually, he won't have ["Curse you, Doom!"] as an aspect anymore.<br/><br/>And honestly, sometimes folks just don't want to make with the complications for various reasons - they'd rather focus on something else, they can't buy into it, etc etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113082/#Comment_113082" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T23:57:21+00:00" title="December  8, 2007 11:57PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>That's why it's important to establish what the limitation is.

Now I have five" (of seven artifacts, the sixth we had and the seventh in London).  So, it was very much an emotional trigger limitation that came up to bite Awesome later.  Like I said, though, I didn't realize that's how I was accepting the compel until later, and I'm not sure that the GM realized that easier.  I think we just hit this "duh, of course" element that happened when the physical exchange of the Fate point occurred.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113107/#Comment_113107" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T09:13:51+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  9:13AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm still a little confused about compels.

These are sort of "plot driver" compels that are sourced out of PC aspects -- ones where the GM's sitting there thinking up the situation for the evening, looks over at Ian's character sheet, sees that aspect, and decides, yeah, I'm gonna have KKK goons crawling all over this adventure looking to kick his ass.<br/><br/>As a GM when I make a decision like this, sometimes I'll just hand Ian the fate point right up front, when we sit down to start play, and smile enigmatically.  "You'll understand what that's for later."<br/><br/>These sorts of compels and fate points are, in my mind, "Thank you for being interesting" compels.  They operate within the reward cycle of compels, technically, because the aspect information taken from the character sheet *is* being used to complicate the character's life.  But it has an element of fiat to it that pretty much entirely skips the "I reject that" element because -- as you rightly put it -- "Why would you ever not want to complicate the situation?"<br/><br/>Sometimes the option to object is <i>obviously of no value</i>.  So it doesn't have to be addressed, explicitly, in those situations.  Skip it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113132/#Comment_113132" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T12:52:02+00:00" title="December  9, 2007 12:52PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>This is useful, by the way.<br/><br/>I'm still a little confused about compels.

I'm incredibly jealous of what Jason's got in the Durham 3 group he's a part of.  I've had to go over and over how Compels are a communication tool between the GM and the players on what they prefer.  <b>Many</b> players will turn down Compels by default.  I'm careful to explicitly state, "Okay, I just learned there that that's not where you wanted to go with that Aspect.  Let's talk a little bit at the break about how you see that Aspect playing out and what you want it to add to play.  Maybe the Aspect needs to be reworded or maybe I just don't know what kind of Compels you were looking for."<br/><br/>One of the guys is totally comfortable with Compels.  I'm thinking of taking him aside between sessions and asking him to enthusiastically accept what appears to be a completely ludicrous Compel, so we can demonstrate really clearly that it's a safe and fun thing to do - that I'm not going use it as an opportunity to stick it to the character.  Like maybe he gets captured and tied up in the main antagonist's lair but he doesn't lose any stage time (gains it, if anything), and isn't behind the eightball for long.<br/><br/>When a group really cares about Story and really trusts one another, of course they're going to accept almost all the Compels, (or maybe suggest something even cooler!)
