They were like "let's meet at that big rock" and I was thinking "how would they ever find their way back to that rock?" etc etc.<br/><br/>I guess coming up with a ruling wouldn't be the hard part ("it takes twenty days. both of you roll survival checks to reduce that by the average of your two rolls." [so if they roll 15 and 6 they spend 10 days separated] or "dc 12 to find each other, dc 20 to not be lost when you do" or "ok, I'll just put you on the encounter table." \u2014 I came up with these today, the day after, in this order and I like the third one the best almost.)<br/><br/>The hard part would be having buy-in. If they're like "no come on, it's super easy to find a shared place in the jungle"... This is why I love rules.<br/><br/>We've taken to sometimes coming up with house rules together.<br/><br/>Like they wanted to be able to boil water to purify it and I was like "OK, so the book has rates for how much water you can purify iff you have proficiency with brewer's supplies. So we need the rate, or chance of success, to be no higher than that." That was sort of our guideline. (Usually I have a hard time with feats like that because they limit my ability to adjudicate that people can just do anything \u2014 if I have to know every spell, every manuever, every feat and every proficiency in the book in order to not "step on anyone's toes" \u2014 even though no-one's ever had proficiency with brewer's supplies \u2014 well then the game kind of sucks.) And I suggested some random chance of it working or some lower rate of purification. And then one of the players came up with the perfect rule \u2014 same rate of gallons per hour, but you still have to make the con saves when you drink the water \u2014 the amateur purification only gives you advantage. The water is still risky, only less risky. (For the purposes of logistics we call this "compromised water"). Perfect!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473405/#Comment_473405" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-06T06:18:26+00:00" title="May  6, 2018  6:18AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another house rule that originated from the players was the "can't we say that there is a 1/20 chance of no rain?" when they heard the new weather rules.

When they are in the same hex they have a small probability (depends on the hex scale and the terrain) of stumbling upon each other, higher if they follow roads or such. When they try to find their landmark, they need to be in the correct hex (not a given if the party gets badly lost; they might not even know that they're not in the right hex) and have to succeed in an orienteering check, or search for it tenaciously. If both sub-parties find the landmark in the same time-window (that is, one of them hasn't left before the other arrives), then they find each other automatically, of course - that's the point of having a designated meeting place.<br/><br/>The ideal meeting place would be one that is easy to find. This often means it being higher than the rest of the wilderness, so you can spot it directly from a long ways off. Being on a waterway works as well, as it's more difficult to walk past a lake or river than a big rock in the middle of a forest.<br/><br/>If the situation was particularly important, rather than the usual emergent routine, I would institute a communication block between the sub-parties. Makes it more difficult psychologically when you waste a day trying to find the meeting spot, and then there's nobody there when you arrive - did the others already give up on me, or are they still to come here later?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473409/#Comment_473409" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-06T11:58:41+00:00" title="May  6, 2018 11:58AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A comms block between the players too?

If it was a high-stakes situation, I would run it as a skill challenge if they were being pursued or if lingering in the wilderness was intrinsically dangerous. If nothing was particularly at stake, however, I would just tell them you meet up in X number of days.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473562/#Comment_473562" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T19:30:04+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  7:30PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the wilderness is very dangerous here.
