It's what I imprinted on, what I started to run (more or less -- I did some system mashup stuff). The best of the best are well researched, well written, often well set up mysteries or good at pinging a emotional note that works for me or both. More recently, I've been enjoying the freedom to have my characters fail. None of this is specific to CoC, but that's where I found it first. And it can get me reading history books. It also made me realize that it's not that I don't like the horror genre, but that I'm picky about the type of horror I like. The system gets out of my way, for the most part (just don't make me look for the grapple rules!). Some published campaigns are good introductions for beginning GMs.<br/><br/>A good Call of Cthulhu game can be as edgy as the edgiest indie game. There's flexibility of setting -- the mythos can be anywhen -- but also some stability -- the more-or-less real world + mythos setting. It's -- so, I read a piece on the television show Friday the 13th (about the cursed antiques shop), and it noted, accurately, that the show was never the best thing on tv, but it told stories about people -- what they wanted, what they feared, and what they'd do to get the first and avoid the second. There's a whole lot of room to suck, but also a whole lot of room to shine.<br/><br/>There's huge flexibility about subject matter. Human horror? Uncaring universe? Cruel gods playing with humans? Gorefest horror? Heck, ditch the mythos per se and do twisted dark fairy tales? I'm in. Stross's Laundry? Heck, yes -- Black Bag Jobs is amazing!<br/><br/>There's the community. At Origins, I played with some of the same people year after year, all of us self selecting to play Call of Cthulhu with others who take it seriously, and trust builds up over that time. There's the geek element -- again, hardly unique to CoC. But, I found myself delighted to learn that the Romans had a term for prostitutes who conduct their business in graveyards; that there was a man who called himself Black Herman and was known as the Black Houdini, whom I'd never heard of despite having an interest in stage magic; that hobos created their own union and their own annual convention -- you get the idea.<br/><br/>Over the Edge / WaRP. It's my go to system. Fate's edging it out, but if I need something simple and flexible, where a character sheet can fit on the back of a business card, where I can stat up NPCs and PCs on the fly, where I can color code six dice small enough to fit in a gumball machine bubble, it's perfect.<br/><br/>There might be more on the list ten years from now. I've been playing some flavor of Fate for the last few years, and running the Kerberos flavor for the last couple of years.<br/><br/>Everway and Pendragon would be on the list if I played them more often. Everway is something I can easily fall back into, so perhaps it should be. It's just that I've not played it in a while. I've got most, if not all, Pendragon books, but I've only played it three times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417404/#Comment_417404" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T05:48:05+00:00" title="June 28, 2013  5:48AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Lisa: BRP-based games, most often Call of Cthulhu (although, slowly that's being transitioned over to the newer GUMSHOE rules for games where we'd otherwise be using BRP).<br/><br/>D&amp;D: while these days we're playing an old-school rule set (ACKS), it seems churlish to not admit that this is the same game we started with so many years ago. (We've played D20-based things for some time, as well, in bits and pieces.)<br/><br/>For two decades, we played HERO, up through to the fifth edition. We have not played it recently (last couple years), but it's still something we might come back to -- it was our go-to rule system for a very long time. It's quite heavy-weight, and people are more happy to play it, than referee it, which probably explains why we haven't picked it up in a while: everyone in our group in the regular GM rotation has had a want to try out other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417407/#Comment_417407" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T06:20:44+00:00" title="June 28, 2013  6:20AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not been playing enough to have one of these...yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417408/#Comment_417408" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T06:30:37+00:00" title="June 28, 2013  6:30AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Same here.

Sadly, not everyone I play with shares my love of the system--I think my group mostly tolerates it in <i>Masks</i>, except possibly for OP, who is interested in a lot of indie systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421719/#Comment_421719" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-20T18:56:38+00:00" title="September 20, 2013  6:56PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Pathfinder this year once, as a friend of mine had only played Dungeon World and wanted to compare it to the normal thing people call D&amp;D.  Pathfinder was a lot easier and more entertaining to play after playing DW, too -- I'm definitely not one of those people who says "But I always ran games that way," so it was fun to go back to D&amp;D and see how much fun it could be with some new thoughts.  But, we went back to DW after that because it fit better.<br/><br/>When did Universalis come out?  I'd still play that, although once I finish reading Microscope and hopefully have someone facilitate it for me I might change my tune there.<br/><br/>tremulus ate CoC for me.<br/><br/>I played Vampire the Masquerade within the last couple years too, and it was fun enough -- but like Pathfinder, it was a game I gm'd and I didn't really explain how the system worked, and I just worked out the dice rolls on my own and told people what to roll.  (It worked for that group.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
