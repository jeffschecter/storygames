Has anyone tried it? Does it work? Do you have to rewind? How's the voice acting (because I'm an actor, you see, and like that sort of thing)?

Here's my take.  I like the game I want to play the game.  I don't think I would use the actual CD in play though.  This is because I think having listened and read the rules myself I could communicate the game to a bunch of new players faster than working through the audio.  Also while the audio does a fantastic job of walking you through the procedures of play it only tells you just enough to get you through the next bit of procedure.  However, there are things about LATER procedures I think the players should know about when their executing earlier procedures because they effect each other and the audio doesn't do that.<br/><br/>The biggest example is the stuff about organizing evidence into chains.  The audio tells you how to organize evidence to chains when you first need to do it but it doesn't tell you what effect that organization has until much much later.  I could easily someone thinking they would have made different decisions had they known what was coming procedurally.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186641/#Comment_186641" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T13:24:26+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  1:24PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I playtested the game (mp3 is <a href="http://www.darkomengames.com/files/ActualPlay/Serial/SerialProfileHomeless.mp3" rel="nofollow">here</a>(62 MBs)) but that was before the audio release format.

I was focusing in on the MP3 question.<br><br>The game is designed to create sympathy for the victims in the game. As I recall from Rob's interview, the game is actually based more on true crime than on serial killer stories. In any event, in these stories, usually the serial killer is the cool character. He gathers the most interest and attention.<br><br>Not so in <i>Serial Homicide Unit</i>.<br><br>Basically, here's how it works. Each player plays one citizen, who is a potential victim of the killer. He is defined by his Hope. So, for example: "I hope that I get my first novel published." Of course, during setup, every other player has stacked up some Obstacle against this Hope. Say, "Need to overcome procrastination" or "Too scared to submit manuscript" or the like.<br><br>The game is played in rounds. Each round has two phases. During the first phase, each player plays out a scene of his citizen trying to achieve his Hope by overcoming one of the Obstacles. So, what you get are vignettes of people trying to live their lives.<br/><br/>After this phase, there's an investigation phase, where the players play the different investigators trying to find the serial killer. During round one, a John Doe is discovered, which kicks off the investigation.<br/><br/>But, during setup, you've written down the names of each of the citizens on business cards, put them in envelopes, and handed a random envelope to each player. Then, after the second round of citizen scenes, the first player opens his envelope. That character? Dead.<br/><br/>So, that single mother who was trying to get her first novel published? Found in her apartment, naked and lying in a pool of her own blood from the multiple stab wounds that cover her torso.<br/><br/>All those hopes and dreams...gone.<br/><br/>Raymond Chandler wrote, "[M]urder is an act of infinite cruelty, even if the perpetrators sometimes look like playboys or college professors or nice motherly women with softly graying hair." <i>Serial Homicide Unit</i> makes you feel that.<br/><br/>And then, you're playing the investigators, trying to get together enough evidence to indict. This process is kinda like Otherkind dice. Each investigator gets to make up a random number of clues (up to 5, as I recall). Clues are put in chains of evidence. Each chain of evidence can potentially produce one success in an attempt to indict. If you attempt to indict, you roll dice equal to the number of chains of evidence. The number of clues in the chain is the target number. However, you need more successes than there are players in order to be able to indict. Otherwise, you taint your evidence. That's not a total loss, but it takes time to reapply the clues in those tainted chains of evidence.<br/><br/>So, there you are, staring at the available evidence. You <i>might</i> be able to indict, if you act now. But that case seems awfully flimsy. What if you roll badly? Maybe you should wait and gather more evidence.<br/><br/>But then you look at the next envelope. If you wait, then someone else will die. Will it be Bob, the car salesman who is trying to become manager? Or Julie, the older woman who is putting her life back together after a divorce? Who will be the next body to turn up, naked and violated?<br/><br/>Can you afford to wait? Can you afford not to?<br/><br/><i>That's</i> what happens in the game. It's really, really intense.<br/><br/>And, yeah, it's awesome. ;-)<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186766/#Comment_186766" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T04:55:46+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  4:55AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very interesting.
