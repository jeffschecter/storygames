You have to get into a collaborative dialog with the other player much more than in other styles of play.  If you don't establish that back-and-forth repertoire, then one player often ends up dominating play to the detriment of the other's experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298380/#Comment_298380" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-26T16:41:19+00:00" title="October 26, 2010  4:41PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two player games thrive on intensity and super focused play.<br/><br/>Sorcerer or Perfect as a two player game is all about power dynamics and hard choices.

The "difficulty" with two player games is that there is no one else to lean on.  Either both players come to the table ready to contribute, or you can expect a less than rewarding experience.  I think certain games draw people into the two player experience better than others.  In that way, to use a cliche, system matters.  Nonetheless, any two player game still requires a certain commitment to the collaborative process.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298455/#Comment_298455" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T10:38:54+00:00" title="October 27, 2010 10:38AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm hearing "yes, totally possible, but maybe your wife's just not into it, can't make the commitment."<br><br>I'm not quite ready to give up yet, though.  Maybe there's some system(s) / technique(s) / mechanic(s) that can make it happen.<br><br>And let me get more specific.  In some of my 2-player games, I think stigma was a factor.  Trad players are fond of saying that 2-player rpg's suck, and with trad games that can be very true, because a big part of the fun is the orthogonal characters switching off moments in the spotlight.  And I still hear people say that, even though things should be different now.  Plus you've got your law of social proof:  I'm playing a pickup game at an open game night or something, and only one other guy wants to play.  Ergo, we must be losers, right?  So I've really liked just reading about other people saying "yes, 2 player games can be awesome."  <br><br/>The stigma isn't so much a problem when playing with the wife though.<br/><br/>As for intimacy, I think we've totally got that.  Not a problem.  And we're both contributing.  With my wife, she's usually contributing more - because I'm bending over backwards to make sure it's a story she'll engage with, so I'm letting her do as much creation as she can stand.<br/><br/>If anything's missing, it's flow.  Momentum.  With a decent multi-player game, the system and the players start engaging and it feels like the story writes itself, you know?  But with our two-player games, whether it's BTI or S/lay or Universalis, we've got to work for it.  What happens next?  Back when I fancied myself a novelist I used to count the words I'd produced each day (a lot of writers do that, so I'm told) and it's that same feeling, "Man, we've still got 200 words to go, what are we going to write next?"<br/><br/>Ok, so what you guys got?

Are you trying too hard to make the story "good"?  When I play S/lay w/ Me I just say whatever pops into my head based solely on the imagery at hand.  The games are WEIRD but totally hypnotic.<br/><br/>For example, I played a game in which I decided I wanted to see what happened when the Monster and the Lover were the same entity.  The Hero was wandering around these vast underground caverns looking for a way out.  I introduced the Lover as this kind of mate-devouring tribal shaman woman.  And Sayler, playing the Hero, had his guy kill her current mate.<br/><br/>What I did from that point forward was begin almost all of my goes like this, "You wander around the caves for about a week."<br/><br/>After the first week he encountered the Lover among all her dead tribesmen.  Without a mate she had been unable to feed or breed and so everyone had died.  She had literally cried a river of tears and she tried to drown him in it.<br/><br/>After the second week he found the Lover had turned into this almost spider like creepy crawly thing that tried to claw and bite him.<br/><br/>After the third week he found the Lover a decayed corpse that collapsed as it crawled after him until finally her head popped off, rolled across the floor and landed at his feet where she spit acid on his face before finally dying.<br/><br/>BUT!  He used his Good Dice to "save the Lover from harm" and he incorporated into his go that he picked up the skull and brought it out into the sunlight of the exit he'd finally found.  He then raised the skull, kissed it, and as he did so the Lover reformed and two left together.<br/><br/>Afterwards, Sayler said, "That was disgusting.... in a totally sexy kind of way."  And I said, "I'm pretty sure S/lay w/ Me is the game where you're totally convinced the story is the other guy's fault."<br/><br/>Which brings me to my second point.  I think S/lay w/ Me works best when you're more or less completely unconcerned with what the other player might think of your contribution.  Just lose yourself in the fantasy and trust the other player will do the same.  If you're both trying to either make the story go some where specific or trying to please each other in some way or trying not to step on each other's toes too much, it won't work.<br/><br/>The sense of intimacy in these games comes from creative vulnerability.  To be kind of crude about it just put your kink on the table and let them deal with it.<br/><br/>That's my 2 cents.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafe" title="Rafe"><img alt="Rafe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/580/nVD52VTM5722R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafe">Rafe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298474/#Comment_298474" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T11:58:28+00:00" title="October 27, 2010 11:58AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, jdfristrom, I actually don't know if they are. I'm not as "well traveled" in terms of small-press RPGs as most folks here. I know of some games out there, but not many. I know about stuff by Luke Crane, Vincent Baker, John Harper and a few things by Jared Sorensen (and know of both Sorcerer and Riddle of Steel though I haven't played either one), but otherwise I'm kinda clueless. That's why I left the statement vague and didn't make any specific recommendations.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, though... the interest in the game and story has to be there. If the people you've made these attempts with are social players, one-on-ones might not do it for them, no matter what system you use; they just might want more people around to help build up the game. Some people also don't like to be the sole focus of a game's attentions. There's no downtime and often there's no sense of being able to pull back and gather your thoughts. I freakin' love it, personally, but that doesn't stand for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not make an attempt at a three-person game, with the two players' characters tightly linked a la Raistlin and Caramon or something similar? That might be enough to give you the kind of experience you're looking for (very personal) but also give the players opportunities to fall out of the spotlight and take a breath.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Bunyip" title="The Bunyip"><img alt="The Bunyip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/758/nIGUP7BK8UEFU.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Bunyip">The Bunyip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298475/#Comment_298475" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T12:10:01+00:00" title="October 27, 2010 12:10PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only played one 2-player RPG ever.  It was about 20 years ago now and it was awesome.  I ran the game, my mate Sid was the player.<br/><br/>I've often wondered what made that game so intense and great to play for both of us, and the answer, I think was that the plot was so strong.  The reason it was strong because it was lifted wholesale from a swords &amp; sorcery fantasy novel I had just finished reading.  I basically presented the plot of the novel, which involved a mystery to solve.  The story was pretty directed (the PC was a loner who came across a caravan when travelling across a harsh desert - he had no choice but to travel with them for his own survival).  <br/><br/>So my tip for <i>one way</i> to make a fun 2-player game: Pick a novel or short story that the player hasn't read and lift the plot from it.  Make sure it's a plot that has a mystery to solve and that the player is pretty much impelled to go along with it.<br/><br/>You might as well pick a really simple rule system too.  I'd favour The Pool.<br/><br/>(In case you're interested the novel was <a href="http://www.coverbrowser.com/image/vintage-books/1009-1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><i>Brak the Barbarian Versus the Mark of the Demons</i> by John Jakes</a>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnfiore" title="johnfiore"><img alt="johnfiore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnfiore">johnfiore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298508/#Comment_298508" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T14:44:20+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  2:44PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2010 2:47PM by johnfiore.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If anything's missing, it's flow.

I'm really honored!<br/><br/>The World Player's "chunks" can be any size you'd like. I keep them small and improvise if they pop up during the game. Since there's no guarantee that the conflicts will arise during play, don't spend too much time prepping them. <br/><br/>For example, my friend and I are playing an irreverent game tomorrow night spoofing those cheesy ghost hunter cable shows with all that night vision and eerie music and no actual ghosts. \n<blockquote><b>Halls of the Unhaunted</b><br/><br/><b>Genre:</b> Comic Tragedy<br/><b>Size:</b> One unhaunted location at a time<br/><br/>There are houses, castles, and factories in this world rumored to be haunted by angry spirits and vengeful ghosts\u2026places where the dead do not rest.<br/><br/>What lurks within the shadows of these infamous places?<br/><br/>Nothing.<br/><br/>What hides in the darkest corners of their most notorious rooms?<br/><br/>Dust. Maybe a spider.<br/><br/>There are no supernatural forces at work within any of these buildings, no poltergeists aching for justice, and no legitimate scientific evidence to suggest that creaking boards and poor insulation are phenomena requiring more than just a good contractor.<br/><br/>Yet, defying all common sense, rare individuals have arisen to brave the horrors of personal humiliation and professional ridicule in order to prove that which cannot be proven \u2013 that ghosts really do exist! Armed with state-of-the-art thingies, these champions of too much free time take rationalizing to the extreme and get all up in reality's grill, daring it to shake their unwavering belief in the Beyond!</blockquote>\nOne of my conflicts is <i>literally </i>"Bat on a string." That's it. Let's see the ghost hunters try to get past that to prove that the supernatural exists!<br/><br/>Of course, you can always make conflicts as super-detailed as you'd like.<br/><br/>Thanks for trying WvH!

I definitely had fun playing it with my daughter and don't know why we stopped.  That might give me what I need to regain momentum when we get stuck.  I never bought the GM emulator - does it have additional work on top of what went into Mythic?<br/><br/>Mythic's really interesting - it was my first improv, no-prep game (er, not counting Universalis) - in hindsight, it's more restrictive than the improv games I've played lately - most of the advice I've seen lately is "Go obvious" or "Say yes" - but with Mythic you have to roll, and my feeling was it made me stretch.  My first idea?  Nope.  Keep looking.  On the surface you'd think that would block momentum and flow, but maybe because it forces me to dig deeper it makes me surprise myself - and then because I'm surprised I'm more excited to go on?
