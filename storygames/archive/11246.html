Sure, there have been plenty of supplements for systems like d20, but it's always been about gear and stuff and not enough about the raw physicality, the bloodthirst and sacrifice, the raging class conflict and all the rest of what actually makes a gladiator story interesting.<br/><br/>A game like <i>Spartacus</i> would have violence, to be sure (how could it not?), but the point of it doesn't seem to be so much the combat but the intersection of all the above-mentioned elements.  There should be outsized personal conflicts that can't be resolved at the point of a gladius, and irresistible desires for things (sex, money, power) that can only be gotten through the skillful manipulation of social levers.  And then more ass-kicking.<br/><br/>I'm sure someone's going to tell me that <i>Primetime Adventures</i> can handle this.  Seems like every time I think, "Hey, X would be a good idea," someone's either done it with PTA or thought of a way to do it with the system.  I'd still like to see someone tackle this concept in a little boutique game with a hard focus on the elements above.  As I've said countless times before on various threads, I'm not a game designer or even an aspiring one, but I know a solid concept when I see one.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249805/#Comment_249805" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T05:28:01+00:00" title="January  6, 2010  5:28AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm...

They'd definitely have to be a slave, and probably a reluctant killer as well (but good at it nonetheless, of course).  Part of the initial game would, for me, need to \u201cseed\u201d reasons why I cared so much about their fate and what it would mean both for them and for my character if they could make their way through a gauntlet of fights.  And there would need to be some connection scenes with each of the PCs before any melee began.<br/><br/>Part of what I like about this community and many of the games that have come out of it  is how many of its players are willing to see their characters come to ruin, or to Pyrrhic victories in the cause of story.  But the flip side of that, in even some of my favorite games, like PTA, is you can find yourself almost hoping for the hammer to fall on your PC for the sake of the heightened drama that will come with it.  So you <i>may</i> find yourself less invested in the conflict  mechanics.  (<i>\u201cThat would SUCK!  I'm going to spend all my Fan Mail to prevent THAT!\u201d</i> but secretly...  <i>\u201cI kind of hope I fail this \u2013 that would be really interesting.\u201d</i>)<br/><br/>But threaten an NPC you care about, and make the stakes about them?  Yeah, that can be really powerful, so there is absolutely something there...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253043/#Comment_253043" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T04:35:02+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  4:35AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I think Daniel is really on to something.<br/><br/>It's a good thing I have a game tonight to distract me, or I would start writing it.</blockquote>\nJohn, I hope you do pick up the thread and design something because I'd be very interested to see what you come up with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253178/#Comment_253178" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T11:36:49+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 11:36AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I think Daniel is really on to something.<br/><br/>It's a good thing I have a game tonight to distract me, or I would start writing it.</blockquote>\nJohn, I hope you do pick up the thread and design something because I'd be very interested to see what you come up with.<br/><br/>Quit distracting him, heh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253183/#Comment_253183" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T11:48:30+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 11:48AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using Agon as a base would seem to fit perfectly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
