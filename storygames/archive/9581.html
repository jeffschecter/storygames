They are idiosyncratic: one likes a <i>tiny</i> amount of sugar, approximately a quarter of a teaspoon; one likes their tea black. I personally like herbal tea, for which I receive an appropriate amount of stick. I think it is because of my preference for herbal tea that I am not trusted to make real tea.<br/><br/>How do you arrange tea-making among your group?

However, it's fun to talk about. At our regular games, it works like this:<br/><br/>- As the guests arrive, I ask if anyone wants coffee. Regardless of the answer, I start brewing coffee, or ask my wife Monica to brew coffee. When it's done, we ask who wants coffee, because we forgot, and most of the guests didn't hear us the first time anyway.<br/>- During dinner, there are bottles of coke and sprite on the table, as well as water. People usually help themselves to this, and make sure all the children present get what they need. (The children are good at letting us know).<br/>- Sometimes we might have red wine and/or beer at dinner. I ask who wants some, and give it to them, trying to ignore the sullen silence of the poor souls who have to drive that night. <br/>- In general, I _think_ I'm in charge of making sure people get coffee and alcohol. Sometimes it happens without my initiative or intervention, because I'm busy acting like I'm a real GM and people think what I say is important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212635/#Comment_212635" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T10:37:41+00:00" title="June 16, 2009 10:37AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When someone goes to get a Dr. Pepper, anyone else may say "+1!" and rightly expect to be brought a Dr. Pepper, except for Mike.

The sweet tea I've had had a noticeable difference in viscosity.  You could feel the difference between unsweetened tea and sweet tea, even if you had no sense of taste.<br/><br/><br/>In the games that occur in my house, it goes like this: I typically make a pitcher of iced tea the afternoon before game, and offer it to people if I remember.  Sometimes they drink, sometimes they are disappointed in the lack of other options (water and milk and rarely Kool-Aid).  <br/><br/>In the games that occur in other people's houses what happens is I think halfway through the game that I would like a cup of tea, when my caffeine withdrawal causes a headache.  Then I go in their kitchen, look in their cabinet and curse the fact that they only own herbal "tea".  So I wind up taking some non-caffeinated soda or soda-like substance from their fridge and my PC becomes more antagonistic because of the headache.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212655/#Comment_212655" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T11:51:58+00:00" title="June 16, 2009 11:51AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my old gaming group we made of game of being the <i>"brew bitch"</i>.<br/><br/>Starting from the moment you set foot in the house, if you uttered the sound "tee" you were immediately hit by a chorus of <i>"milk and two sugars"</i>, <i>"really milky please"</i>, <i>"I'll have coffee"</i>, <i>"yes please, thanks for offering"</i>, etc.<br/><br/>IC or OOC, if you vocalised "tee" you were nailed.

I usually host our gaming, but I tend to only drink water while rolling dice (I find caffeine, sugar, and alcohol all muddle my brain enough to distract me from the game).<br/><br/>That said, I will sometimes pick up a bottle of Coke or Sprite before a game and leave it in the fridge for all to use. Mostly people bring all their own drinks, because they all have their own picky requirements. Thomas and Aaron drinks Coke Zero, but they each bring their own since they tend to have it in their own fridges, and don't share because everyone else thinks Zero tastes like drinking pond water. Aaron also often brings his "energy drink of the week" pick. John drinks Pepsi, or whatever they had at the store. Mike drinks beer, and always offers to share, but the rest of us almost never take him up on it, since we often play on weeknights and don't want to accidentally cross the gathering/party boundary which sometimes happens since we're all friendly and rowdy. Erin (when she plays, which is sadly rare) drinks water or juice. Amber usually brings her own club soda (and, yes, she drinks it straight. I can't figure it either).<br/><br/>On the rare occasion that I need the caffeine just to plough through, I will offer to make it for everyone, but I think Aaron is the only one who ever takes me up on it. We both take tea black, as far as I know, so that makes it easy.<br/><br/>Therefore we can conclude that my group is fractious, clannish, distrustful, and on the verge of a frenzy of violent betrayal. Kinda like a <i>Diplomacy</i> group, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212666/#Comment_212666" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T12:32:58+00:00" title="June 16, 2009 12:32PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Friday gaming nights:<br/>There is a variety of canned pop in the (attached) garage.

Aaron also often brings his "energy drink of the week" pick. John drinks Pepsi, or whatever they had at the store. Mike drinks beer, and always offers to share, but the rest of us almost never take him up on it, since we often play on weeknights and don't want to accidentally cross the gathering/party boundary which sometimes happens since we're all friendly and rowdy.

AUDACITY to make myself some instant black coffee. We always had a hot water jug (mostly) full, so what would have been a ten second process (pour, stir) got me press-ganged into a several-minute job of sorting three different types of tea into six mugs, each of which had different amounts of sugar or milk (or fucking LEMON!), and the damned preppy girl of the house (it's was like a John Hughes movie with accents) INSISTED that her milk be put in AFTER the tea steeped, and the Portuguese dude wanted his to steep longer and--*SCREAM*<br/><br/>A couple of seriously foul servings later, and I was forever off the hook.

He takes it straight, no sugar or milk. I boil water and put the tea bag in a teapot to steep for him. I also get people glasses of water.<br/><br/>Previously, the players would self serve water and one player would keep a 2 or 3 liter bottle of Coke in my fridge.<br/><br/>Sometimes in the past, players would bring snacks. The current group isn't that much into snack bringing. Occasionally I have a snack to offer.<br/><br/>Interesting about pop/soda/tonic/etc. My mom usually calls it tonic but I'm a soda man (or rarely soda pop). My mom grew up in Melrose MA, I grew up in Concord and Lexington MA. I used to be surprised/confused by pop etc, but not any more.<br/><br/>Back in North Carolina, I used to occasionally make a pot of "hot" tea (being as in NC, "tea" is that sickly sweet stuff others have already mentioned - even in a Japanese restaurant, my dad asked for tea and got sweet tea...).<br/><br/>When I drink tea, I take it with lots of sugar. I rarely go for herbal teas, many of them taste funky to me and leave me queasy (as opposed to black or green tea which just sometimes triggers my acid reflux).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213208/#Comment_213208" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T13:07:58+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  1:07PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my group, it depends on the game.<br/><br/>If we're high-trust game, then I'm happy to put the kettle on. I drink black tea -- some of my Vanilla Almond from Republic of Tea, or some Darjeeling 2nd flush that I keep getting at this one tea place -- so if that's what people like, awesome.  Otherwise, folks are cool to bring their own tea bags or balls, and we'll provide the water, mugs &amp; good times. It's a veritable tea party. (Though, not everyone digs on tea, and that's cool, too.)<br/><br/>If we're low-trust, like a competitive game, then we're in a "go fuck yourself" attitude. Bring your own kettle, your own mug, your own tea. Or hope you have allies and have something worth offering. And then there's the issue of getting up in the middle of your game to freshen your cup. In short: don't unless you're already losing and want to be a cock about holding up the game.<br/><br/>Which means that on Monday nights (my board game night), the thought of tea doesn't even come up. But it's cool on Fridays (my indie RPG night). Thursdays are weird -- depends on the mood, since we play 4/e.<br/><br/>On the other hand, even in the most competitive game, beer bonds us together. Or hard liquor. Last Monday, we all enjoyed Manhattans while playing Race for the Galaxy. Clearly in our group, tea is a more violent drink.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9581/who-makes-the-tea-and-how-do-you-take-it" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9581/who-makes-the-tea-and-how-do-you-take-it" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9581/who-makes-the-tea-and-how-do-you-take-it/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9581%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9581%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
