That's one of the reasons we created it.<br/><br/>So find the most-interested, most open-minded guy or girl among your gaming or even non-gaming friends and try a two-player game. Maybe The Pool, if you want an easy entry. Breaking the Ice, if your play partner likes romantic stories.

For one, there is not years upon years of "training" to undo. For two, maybe "your" gamers honestly do prefer games where you DO or DO NOT kill the Orcs and benefit accordingly.<br/><br/>They're two almost completely different things, which I think is the point Mike was going for.<br/><br/>I suggest you check out Meetup.com and similar sites for groups like fiction writers, improv theatre troupes, and the likes.

Enjoy gaming with them.  If you want to do something they don't, find new people to do it with.  If you don't have any local indie-friendly gamers, make some.  It's much easier than trying to convert people who've tried it and don't like it.<br/><br/>(That said, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> is a nice middle ground with real-live skills and attributes.

It took a few of us taking a chjance and reaching out to start something that has urned into a fantastic, large and active local community with plenty of enthusiastic players and designers. Rustin, I know it's easier to say then do, but I think if you can find just one or two otehr peole interested in giving this a try that it will snowball into a bigger community for you.

I just sort of felt bad after that and haven't pushed anything.</blockquote>\nSo what you need is "gateway games" -- games that dress up like traditionals, but have a few fun story-game concepts in them.    Games I can think of that have skill lists:<br/><br/>Spirit of the Century<br/>The Shadow of Yesterday<br/>Agon<br/><br/>... those are off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Once you've got them going on that, you can start to "subtract" the skills part.  Maybe introduce them to a PDQ game (Truth &amp; Justice, Zorcerer of Zo, etc) with the idea that Qualities are like Aspects, only merged with skills.  See where that goes.<br/><br/>Then get freaky on 'em.<br/><br/>But you can't throw some people (traditional gamers may be a part of this depending on their tastes) into deep water without teaching them how to swim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85253/#Comment_85253" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T06:44:25+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  6:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred, don't forget Burning Wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85260/#Comment_85260" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T07:03:27+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  7:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Fred, don't forget Burning Wheel.</blockquote>\nTrue enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85295/#Comment_85295" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T08:20:04+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  8:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Fred, don't forget Burning Wheel.</blockquote>\nI've had much better luck with SotC when it comes to players burdened with decades of trad RPG experience.

There are some threads on here and the Forge where I've lamented about my HERO group in particular.<br/><br/>It took a while to work up to it, but you know what I did? <b>I stopped playing with those people.</b> I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest. Spending sessions, week after week, bored out of my mind and hoping they would someday "get it" was just soul-crushing. Life is too damn short to spend your time waiting for other people to change.<br/><br/>The best gaming happens when everyone at the table is invested and enthusiastic about the game, regardless of what RPG is being played. Go and find people who <i>want</i> to play the games in which you're interested. It may take time, but that's okay. Better to wile away that time with some lonely fun (reading RPG books, making PCs, hanging out on gaming fora) than with group frustration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85341/#Comment_85341" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T10:27:52+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 10:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rust</cite>Play traditional d20 style RPG with friends, have some fun but mostly have dissatisfied play experiences,<br/>Reflect on dissatisfaction,<br/>Read web,<br/>Find links to games and actual play reports of cool games,<br/>Buy game(s), (binge shop at IPR)<br/>Read game(s),<br/>Get jazzed,<br/>Try to organize Indie game,<br/>Get poor, often vitriolic and response from group,</blockquote>\nOnce I:<br/>- Contacted my traditional D20 group's significant others.<br/>- Told them, do you want to know what all the excitement is about?

What you need is sex appeal. Drop your dorky friends and invite some ladies over for some provocative, sexy and adventurous gaming. Can I suggest Shooting the Moon, 1001 Nights, Perfect or my own Panty Explosion? Think about it, would you rather spend the evening with a bunch of geeky friends who would rather be playing warhammer or have a night with the girls who want to try something new and cool?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm serious by the way. I've had a lot of fun inviting my female non-gamer friends over to play games. As long as you stay away from geeky stuff you should be okay.
