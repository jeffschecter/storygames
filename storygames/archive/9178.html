The crux of the issue if I got it right was that I had made some unconscious assumptions about the experience of those readig the books. it wasn't that there was anything wrong with the rules, just that I hadn't been quite explicit enough so that a newbie could pick up exactly what I had intended to happen at the table, especially regarding setting difficulties for actions and conflicts. Valamir was making a general comment about a lot of games using mine as an example, and to be fair a lot of people didn't agree and this has never come up in other reviews, hence the rather sprawling thread that resulted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I'm always looking to improve my games. Since then I have contacted Valamir off list and had a brief discussion about this issue, and as a result penned an essay that I hoped explained the process of setting difficulties in greater detail. Valamir kindly gave a read through and made some very useful suggestions, and we ended up with a piece that I think we were both happy with. So, I've stuck it up on my Lulu store as a free download. Please note this doesn't change any of the rules in the game, it just re-emphasises the rules and clears-up any assumptions for the reader. If you're happy with the game as is then fine, but if you want a little more detail, please feel free to download the essay.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/setting-difficulties-in-summerland/6879474<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again to Valamir for all his help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also got my website up and running, www.fireruby.co.uk, some come on over and check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203109/#Comment_203109" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T09:11:48+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  9:11AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            as a person who hasn't yet played or read summerland,<br/>let me say that i think it's great that you're interested in communicating your idea fully <br/>and are glad to work with others to make those ideas more clear.<br/><br/>huzzah!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203119/#Comment_203119" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T10:02:24+00:00" title="April 22, 2009 10:02AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greg, this is a perfect reaction to that whole thing.
