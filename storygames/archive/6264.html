Here's a little teaser-AP from our Tuesday night group:<br/><br/>England of the Tudors:<br/><br/>A teenage Queen, full of resolve, readies herself for coronation.<br/><br/>The land of Faerie seeks to assert it claims over the mundane world.<br/><br/>A haunted well shouts blasphemies into the night against the ruling house.<br/><br/>Sir Francis Walsingham assembles a team of agents and experts to assess the threat posed by the haunted well and resolve it. They are:<br/><br/>\u2022\tEssex, a cold-blooded killer hunting for his lost memories and an opportunity for redemption<br/>\u2022\tKandigar, an exiled prince of Faerie, resolved to renew his claim on stolen lands<br/>\u2022\tBarnaby Blackfriars, a conniving professor coveting secrets that are not his own<br/><br/>Is there room in England for Faerie? Tonight we will find out!<br/><br/>The thing in the Well is a powerful creature of Faerie. Without the proper knowledge and tools, no one can confront it. Gathering these is the first goal of the characters. Do the ends justify the means?<br/><br/>The professor retires to his tower to consult by magic mirror with his Faerie master, Oberon. Essex, smelling a rat, makes his way there first, makes covert entry, and spies on Blackfriars. A complex game of spy and counter-spy ensues. Can Faeries lie? <br/><br/>Oberon orders Blackfrairs to kill Bloody Larkspur, the thing in the well, while simultaneously taunting Essex: capture Bloody Larkspur and I will give you back your memories.<br/><br/>The Professor departs to steal a cold iron cross-missile from the inquisition.<br/><br/>Essex meets with Kandigar to plan a murder.<br/><br/>Is there room in the kingdom for Faerie? In a closed meeting of the privy council, the Queen signs into law a secret decree denying all Faerie claims to English land and banishing all Faerie creatures from the land. Walsingham carefully conceals his agents under a veil of plausible deniability.<br/><br/>Thus ends session one.<br/><br/>We didn\u2019t get much play in, but the basic mechanics seem to work.<br/><br/>The questions included in the text are posed through play. We answer one at the end of the first session, but leave the others for later in the adventure. Players get varying degrees of control over how they\u2019re answered through conflicts in play.<br/><br/>Session two to follow\u2026                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138765/#Comment_138765" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T16:28:52+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  4:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2008 4:29PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm playing Essex (aka Jason Bourne, Tudor style). I won't spoil the outcome of session two, but I will say that someone still owes me some memories, by god. I'm having a lot of fun.<br/><br/>This game used to be good, now it's great. The system is much-streamlined and even more focused on character drives and the Questions that are the point of play. The game is firmly nar-supporting now -- having shed some layers, the true mechanisms of play are emerging and they are more closely aligned with the goals of the game now. Character super-charging has been replaced by character <i>enrichment</i>, similar in feel to the way the Muses of Nine Worlds feel like mini-Kickers instead of XP batteries.<br/><br/>Woo!

Thomas Essex wipes a spot of blood from his cheek and turns to Kentigern the faerie prince. "Look what you made me do." Do the ends justify the means? That is just one of the questions we will answer tonight.<br/><br/>Our story begin earlier that same evening in the Swan and Barrell tavern in Gravesly mews.<br/>Kentigern, exiled faerie prince watches as a drunken knight brags of his lordship over lands that properly belong to Fearie. In the kitchen, the doctored keg waits. All Kentigern needs to complete the plan is pass his alchemical magics over it without raising a ruckus. Can Faeries lie?<br/><br/>"A toast", Kentigern announces, "to the TRUE Lord of Gravesly mews!" Sir Reginald Wotten takes up the toast and the implied challenge. Can a sword-calloused brawler best the timeless cunning of faerie magic?<br/><br/>And so rather than one unconscious knight, the Fey prince leads also four singing drunken tavern rats to the knight's tower where Thomas Essex, the man without memories, the cold-blooded killer, waits.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Thomas Campion, confronts his prisoner, Dr. Barnaby Blackfriars in the Inquisitions stealth zeppelin. "Your own Queen has betrayed you Blackfriars. She has no intention of restoring the Faerie realms. Even now she signs a secret anti-Fey order into law. Join me, and with the secrets of the inquisition we will be strong."<br/><br/>In the Knight's tower, surrounded by corpses, Kentigern steals the memories of the less than noble knight. Does noble blood matter? He hands the cup of memory to Essex. "Take no more than three sips, for the rest belongs to me." With three long draughts, Essex drains the cup dry.<br/><br/>Later that night: a confrontation at the Well above Gravesly Mews. Essex, in the guise of the knight whose memories he has stolen commands Bloody Larkspur the haunt of the well to show itself. Essex captures the Farie, but Barnaby Blackfriars attacks from above with cruci-javelin. In the confusion, Kentigern captures both Faerie and memories, using both to enhance his Fey powers.<br/><br/>Does noble blood matter? No. Kentigern the Faerie usurps the lands of Reginald Wotten and serves as lord in his tower.<br/><br/>Can Faeries lie? No. Armed with Inquisition magic, Dr. Blackfriars binds Kentigern to his will as his Faerie servant.<br/><br/>Do the ends justify the means? No, and the grave deeds done on these grounds leave Gravesly Mews cursed and blighted.<br/><br/>Edit: name fixes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140541/#Comment_140541" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-20T08:07:17+00:00" title="April 20, 2008  8:07AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And just for fun, some pictures of the resolved questions:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/Random/Question1.JPG"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/Random/Question2.JPG"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/Random/Question3.JPG"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
