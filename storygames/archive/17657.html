So, if I'm gonna go down the road of trying to find event space and all that stuff, I wanna know how much demand/interest exists.<br/><br/>So, if you see this post, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEl0LTR5V0tHdDMycjVVNmVTN2VBQXc6MQ" rel="nofollow">take this survey</a>. It'll take you less than 5 minutes. Also, feel free to forward this along to anyone you know who might be even remotely interested.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
