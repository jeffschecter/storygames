I also make medicinal tinctures for friends and family which I don't sell. And best of all I make kombucha year round. I give away the <a href="http://users.sa.chariot.net.au/~dna/kombucha.htm#Kombucha-tea" rel="nofollow">SCOBYs</a> and charge a small fee (to cover shipping and the materials to ship them), and I occasionally give workshops on how to make kombucha. <br/><br/>Ben asked if I would like to advertise my hair oil in one of his books. I never got the ad together, and I didn't make enough hair oil to sustain any extra orders that might have come from the advertising. <br/><br/>I'm thinking about advertising the SCOBY's in one of my games, either Steal Away Jordan, or the one I'm working to have in ashcan form by GenCon.  <br/><br/>My question is, has anyone ever seen ads in game books that were not related to games? Would it look strange or suspicious? Specifically speaking of what I'd like to advertise, I should mention that SCOBY's are really creepy looking and while they have little to do with role playing, they make for good inspiration. In every batch of kombucha tea, the SCOBY spawns another one. (The first SCOBY is called a "Mother", and the new one is called a "baby") They look and feel like fleshy pancakes. Kombucha is an excellent healthy beverage to drink while playing. So I could give the ad an RPG/horror/fantasy feel. Still, would it be out of place?  I don't really care about making money off the SCOBY's, I charge for shipping and the cost of the plastic bags I send them in. Really I just like to share them, and I think other gamers might be interested in making kombucha.<br/><br/>After reading this, it sounds like I'm joking, but I'm not. Should my hobbies never cross paths commercially?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121024/#Comment_121024" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T13:59:41+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  1:59PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd feel odd seeing one.<br/><br/>I guess it'd be better if it were something that one would logically obtain at the same place as Indie RPGs, and if you can't see it, then I can't see it in the book either.<br/><br/>I do think you could place an ad for it on your game's site though, but do note it is not a widespread ad, and it was actually put there, knowingly, by the site (and game's) creator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121027/#Comment_121027" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T14:09:29+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:09PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't be annoyed, but...

I don't think I'll put an ad for SCOBY's in Steal Away Jordan, but I have an idea for a good ad for them in another game, about  scary children and dolls in horror movies and ghost stories.  Seth is right in his description that they look like shuggoths. They're creepy and would fit right into a 1970's horror flick. And kombucha is oddly addictive. <br/><br/>I name my bath salts (and once I get back into, my soaps) after rpg characters. I can't see advertising them though in a game book. But SCOBY's, that's another thing.  I'll probably incorporate an "about the author" thing into it.<br/><br/>Sophie, I hear you on the dislike for ads. I really like them. Then again, I ask for ads from people I know, because I'm happy to promote their work. <br/><br/>Stay tuned and drink Kombucha!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121212/#Comment_121212" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T08:45:18+00:00" title="January 22, 2008  8:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I say go for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have ads on our websites, including our main e-commerce domain, guildofblades.com.
