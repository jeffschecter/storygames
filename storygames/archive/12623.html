Anyone else remember this one?  Kremlin, Diplomacy, and Pax Brittanica were three of my most beloved games from my college days.<br/><br/>One of the cool things about Kremlin is that each of its players would secretly assign a number of Influence Points to the politicians at the beginning of the game.  You each played a different faction within the Communist party and your general goal was to have the politicians who represented your particular ideology rise through the ranks in the Politburo.  But while you knew how much you'd "invested" in influencing each politician you almost never knew for certain whether you had ultimate control of them.  You might work to get Sergei Eatsomuch promoted to KGB Chief and be licking your chops in anticipation of a great purge when one of your opponents reveals that, no, Sergei is actually a loathesome Trot in their camp.  Great fun!<br/><br/>Many games in this community have a certain malleability of character ownership.  There might be some fruitful design territory in a game, maybe political in nature, that used some form of Influence Points to take over control of relevant characters at critical turning points by revealing a player's latent influence.  Maybe a game with fae or demonic possession?  I'm thinking that not all of the Influence resources would necessarily be assigned to characters prior to the game, but added to characters throughout the game, perhaps as a part of scene stakes of some sort.<br/><br/>I'm going to think more about this but I thought I'd throw this out there in case anyone has some thoughts on it.  Or tell me about current designs I'm not aware of that do something similar!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283740/#Comment_283740" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T13:38:17+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  1:38PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds a lot like the seminal Reiner Knizia game, <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105/colossal-arena" rel="nofollow">Titan: the Arena</a>. In it the players bid wagers on fantasy beasts that fight an elimination free-for-all, trying to make it so that the beasts they bid on make it to the end. The exciting part are the special secret bids that ensure that you don't quite know who's horse it is that you're backing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283758/#Comment_283758" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T15:35:28+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  3:35PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great game, a favorite.  You <i>do</i> know who you're backing; you just don't always know who your opponents are backing. (most of their bids are visible, it's that one high-value bid that you don't)<br/><br/>I was thinking about this a bit more.  For a role-playing game design there might need to be some fixed critical decisions that fixed, known-in-advance characters would make as a part of a semi-scripted series of events.<br/><br/>Maybe not.  <i>Something</i> that makes the players want to have control of the NPCs at critical points and smack their foreheads when the tables are unexpectedly turned on them.  <br/><br/>I enjoy the exercise of thinking about it.  If I do develop it I will do it expecting to add it to my pile of  "impractical" designs; games that are cool for a selected audience if you're willing to do the prep but not something you'd likely ever attempt to give or sell to a wide audience.  I'm imagining monolithic NPCs represented by towers like the "Castillo" in El Grande, with the players adding their color "caballeros" to them periodically.  Or opaque cloth bags.<br/><br/>I need a theme.  Mafia?  Soldati maneuvering around one another facing periodic decisions by enigmatic caporegimes?  Something MLwM influenced?  Greek heroes petitioning gods and seeking to impress them with their feats of glory?  A bunch of Paranoia troubleshooters negotiating their way through a  bureaucratic nightmare?  Maybe it's some sort of Midsummer Night's Dream romantic farce...

In that game, you controlled a vampire with (in)human resources underneath of them - a gang of thugs, a police officer, a couple of Childe vampires, and so on. Blood was the currency of the game, and one of the things you could do with it was to feed your thralls. For those familiar with V:tM mythology, this increases their loyalty bonds to you, but costs you blood which could be used for other things (fueling powers, etc) and which must be gathered at expense of either time or stealth (potentially calling the Inquisition down on your territory, etc).<br/><br/>But the idea was that other vampires could feed your thralls as well, without your knowledge. When conflicting orders are given to one of your (essentially) playing pieces, their loyalty algorithm kicks in, and they might perform a totally different order from the one you gave them... either due to "free will" (your bond is not strong enough and your order conflicts with their nature) or due to other vampiric influence. You have no way to determine which other than through statistical analysis, so you cannot know which of your thralls are absolutely trustworthy and which are sleeper agents.<br/><br/>To this day this is a game mechanic I really want to bring into fruition. I think it's usable in many contexts of clandestine political maneuvering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283793/#Comment_283793" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-31T06:30:16+00:00" title="July 31, 2010  6:30AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite><br/>I need a theme.

Or the PCs are the angel and devil on the shoulders of the NPCs, and they can't directly take any actions.  So they're in conflict trying to control the NPCs, who take actual actions.<br/><br/><br/>I just playtested a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/34611997/Department-Nine-Revision-0-2" rel="nofollow">game</a> using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition" rel="nofollow">sortition</a> as a conflict system (stolen from Mist Robed Gate, I think), so that's on my mind.  But I think it would combine nicely here:  You get a specific color of stone.  Over the course of the game your influence abilities add stones to a bag that represents the NPC you're trying to control.  So do the other PCs.  Whenever the NPC has to make a decision, someone draws a stone from the bag, and the color of the stone identifies who controls the NPC for that decision.  As the game goes on, the number of stones in each bag increases, but how much is it worth to you to control the NPC?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
