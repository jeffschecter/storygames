                    I'm sitting here, working out an AP post at the Forge for last night's game, and considering the role of the Agenda cards in the game.  <br/><br/>Originally they were inspired by the Dark Fate cards of tMW, but they don't actually serve the purpose that I was trying to copy there.  See, the purpose that I wan't is two-fold.  First, the Agendas should inspire the players to author a bit of the story and backdrop of the movie.  That part is covered I think.  The second bit is the PC to PC or PC to NPC relationship mapping that should come about from them.  That part is completely missing in some of them!  Hell, the PC to PC part is completely missing.<br/><br/>So, what I'm thinking is that the Agendas should be polarized;  Each should either say something about an NPC that the player will be expected to author or it will say something about <i>another PC</i> that the player will be expected to author.<br/><br/>For example;  Justice (The Evidence) currently calls for a player to author finding the evidence required to bring a nebulous NPC to justice for their crimes.  What if it were amped up to say that your character is searching for the evidence to convict another PC for causing this whole mess with the monsters?  <br/><br/>Bang!  All of a sudden we've got a relationship between the two PCs and some root for conflict.  Stuff that'll inspire more Despair Actions!<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>-Eric                </div>

                            Hi Eric,<br/><br/>Would this presuppose a static web of agendas, and a set number of players?  (Would there be dependencies among all the agendas in cool ways?)<br/><br/>Or would you just be replacing nebulous NPCs with PCs by fiat?  Both would work.                        </div>

                            No, I don't think the set number of players or the static web would be necessary.  I think a tad more work on my part to infuse a little more flexibility in the design of the Agendas, as well as infusing the idea that you don't have 100% autonomy over your PC, will make for overall better design.<br/><br/>I don't think I can get away with overriding NPC with PC by flat fiat either.  <br/><br/>What I'm exploring right now, right this very minute, is what kind of relationship each Agenda could inspire a player to create between his PC and one or more of the other PCs.  <br/><br/>In the example of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justice (The Evidence)</span>, the player is authorized and obligated to author the fiction of one or more of the other protagonists being responsible for the catastrophy, and their PC obtaining the evidence to prove it.<br/><br/>That's a relationship between that player's character and the other PCs, right?  So, the idea is that, if all of the Agenda cards infuse some form of relationship PC-PC then we'll get a much meatier story from their use.<br/><br/>I just haven't quite figured out how to impliment more than the one Agenda in this way yet.<br/><br/>-Eric                        </div>
