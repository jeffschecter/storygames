One thing I love about my common gaming groupies is that we clash in the most unusual (yet non-combative) ways.  One buddy was mentioning how he was really impressed with the artistic content of, ahem, "Game X," and how the full-color pages are what sucked him into the game and made him buy it.  I, on the other hand, was turned off by the price of said game, and stated my preferences for games wherein I'm not paying for 300 pages of a 100-page game.<br/><br/>So how important is visual art to you in your gaming books?  Do you want a picture every page, every three or five or ten?  Do you prefer only a smattering of small and non-distracting B&amp;W images here and there, a la Burning Wheel?  Or do you prefer games with full-folor glossy pages, color bursting vibrantly from the seams?  Somewhere in-between<br/><br/>Or in other words, how does a game's proportion of Art vs Game content sway or stay your wallet?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166944/#Comment_166944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T07:52:48+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  7:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Art does not affect my game purchasing, because I am a soulless monster.<br/><br/>Also, when I want to look at art, I go and look at art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NPC" title="NPC"><img alt="NPC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://nathanaelcole.com/_pics/me/spider.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NPC">NPC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166946/#Comment_166946" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T07:56:35+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  7:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually agree, unless the game's concepts are so against the norm as to benefit from some kind of visual inspirations not easily found elsewhere.

One of my complaints about the new Burning Sands (AEG/basically "Arabia done L5R style") was that while L5R had lots of solid character concept art so I can see what I'm playing, Burning Sands did not, and that made it hard for me to imagine what the setting and characters are like. <br/>Al-Qadim, meanwhile, had all sorts of demihuman BS stapled to an otherwise cool fantasy middle east, and lots of evocative pics to help me understand what I'm going to play in a way that simply talking about the setting could not. I think of this as "The Planescape Effect".<br/><br/>Sometimes there are exceptions, or places where art backfires.<br/>Frex, at GenCon I bought "Anima: Beyond Fantasy" after hearing about it, wanting to try something cruelly unrepentently old-school and fiddly. The evocative art, especially for character types, gods, stuff like that really got me into the feel of the game (it's gorgeous!), and excited to make a character. Unfortunately, the game turned out to be total shit. 300 pages almost completely of character generation. The mechanics aren't that hard, but making a character for this game should be disallowed by the Geneva Convention.

Their layout is pedestrian, with the art getting in the way of the game - not enhancing it, and I don't want to wade through pages of fiction.<br/><br/>And I don't like small books for the same reason: too much text crammed onto small pages (which are awkward to bind if you have a pdf) - and when you add much art, you get a very unfriendly format. Even without art, however, some games should not be in the smaller format.

Honestly, it's one of the many reasons I love the game so much. The artifact itself evokes the nature of the game: a precisely crafted game of weighty stories.<br/><br/>Art, in general, is very important to me. Art (both illustration and layout) isn't just about <i>selling</i> a game. It's about <i>evoking</i> a game. Games like DitV and InSpectres would feel very different to me if they did not have the pitch-perfect layout they do; I bet I'd probably play them differently were that so.<br/><br/>I've been in many conversations with gamers who say they aren't interested in art and just want the content. "Black-and-white, softcover, and no art! Keeps costs down!" That base concern for just <i>data</i>, and nothing but the data, just never makes sense to me. I don't want to pay money for plain ol' data. If I'm paying, I want an <i>experience</i>.<br/><br/>RPG books are tools. They will see constant use. Their <i>artifact quality</i> matters. The art, layout, and information design all impact the reading <i>and</i> the play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167172/#Comment_167172" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T00:05:15+00:00" title="September  5, 2008 12:05AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Art is not the strongest factor for me when I buy a game, but it certainly has an effect. Games with bad art, especially cover art, put me off. Sometimes I'll read a description of a game and think of buying it and then when I see a picture of it I change my mind.<br/><br/>I do like interior character art that tells me, for example, what a Dragonrider, or a Tribsman, or whatever, looks like in the game, if that concept has something distinctive about it (and it should <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167479/#Comment_167479" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T02:57:45+00:00" title="September  7, 2008  2:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a game has a distinctive and unfamiliar setting, then yes, I want art. Jorune without Miles Teves' art would have been hopeless (OK, it can still be problematic even with the art, but hopefully you see my point).<br/><br/>If I already know the setting, art is superfluous and possibly annoying. When I first picked up CoC in the 1980s, the art was very helpful, as I hadn't even read any HPL at that point. Nowadays I just look at it and mainly think how it misses the mark, for me.<br/><br/>For something like Dogs, which is in between, my attitude to the art is pretty neutral too. The artwork in DitV certainly doesn't do it any harm: it looks good, and improves the layout too, but I would have been almost as happy with the game if it had been absent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167483/#Comment_167483" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T06:14:39+00:00" title="September  7, 2008  6:14AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good art isn't always well used art. there are a lot of games that don't make very good use of their excellent art. The art can be part of the game. If you believe that a game can be more then text (which I do), then you can treat the illustrations or other art as part of the game or part of the product that helps convey what the game is about. A picture is worth a lopt more then 1000 words if I can show you what the game is about instead of telling you. If I can show you the kind of emotional content that I'm trying to create. If I can show you the kind of excitement I want you to feel. We normally do this with words, but we can totally do this with pictures. I've had very mixed success with this with my own games. I feel like Panty Explosion, and to a lesser extent Classroom Deathmatch were a wasted opportunity in this regard. The current project I'm working on has a much more integrated visual component.<br/><br/>Not every game will/can/should benefit from good or well used art. But well used art can add a huge amount to an existing game text. breaking the Ice makes excellent use of it's art. So does Mortal Coil. Emily and Brendan where smart to invest in the art they did, and both games benefit from it.<br/><br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167539/#Comment_167539" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T11:52:28+00:00" title="September  7, 2008 11:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Art can tie in directly to the game.  When we started thinking about the art for Beast Hunters, I asked Story Games about putting in tattoo art for the beasts instead of depictions, and I'm glad that I did.  It turns out that that is directly relevant to the dynamic of the game.  Because it's a challenge-based game, where rewards matter, going for and winning actual cool-looking tattoos promotes the whole purpose of the game.  The art is more than window-dressing to sell it or even a medium to communicate: it is an integral and continuing pillar of the whole experience.<br/><br/>Many traditional games work art like that.  Just think of all the cool equipment splat books that sell because we get to salivate over the awesome-looking weapons and gadgets that we might gain for our characters in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
