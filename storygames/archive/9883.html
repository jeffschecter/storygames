Which means that the three sizable boxes of old-school gaming books and magazines have to go. <br/><br/>So these books are all lying in piles in my living room, awaiting triage, and I cannot help but pick them up. There's so much cool stuff in them! It makes me not want to get rid of anything.<br/><br/>For example, I am planning a Storming the Wizard's Tower game for next week, and I didn't have any real ideas, but now I have a super awesome Chinese adventure ready to go, complete with neat monsters, evocative gear lists and inspiring character types:<br/><br/>* From <b>GURPS China</b> I got a bunch of interesting NPC occupations for the "People" list (charcoal maker, Minister of Waterways, etc.) and all kinds of stuff for the "Gear" list that sets up the setting without needing descriptions (signal kites, firecrackers, yarrow sticks, eight diagram divining coins, etc).<br/><br/>* From Palladium's <b>Mystic China RPG</b>, I got character types (Geomancers and Demon Hunters), weapons (war fans! fire arrows! powdered jade! Lion Head swords!), cool Chinese names for existing spells, and so many martial arts ideas that I added a "Kung-Fu" section as a new list. Plus tons of great art and some cool Chinese monsters.<br/><br/>* From <b>Oriental Adventures </b>(1st edition and 3rd edition) I got more weapons and gear, Chinese names for standard adventuring tools and occupations, and a whole pile of magic items to use as minor treasures.<br/><br/>So, no real point to make here, I guess, other than how much weird, cool, interesting source material is there in all sorts of games one might not actually play anymore.<br/><br/>Although I still need to get rid of most of these books...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219601/#Comment_219601" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T10:51:29+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 10:51AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could be possible to donate to a local game club library, or maybe even a flgs that keeps a library of used games for folks to use in store...
