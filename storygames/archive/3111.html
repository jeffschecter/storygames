In fact I play Magic and spend more money on Magic than I play or spend on RPGs. That's not my preference, but it is what's readily available to me right now.<br/><br/>Anyway I read the MTG homepage most days and today found this <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/tf35" rel="nofollow">fascinating article</a> (control-f for the phrase Set Some Clear Social Mores and you'll be at the interesting part) which could be a thread from here about creative agendas and social contracts and stuff.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71236/#Comment_71236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T20:47:53+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  8:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems (and maybe no more than seems) that a limit of the collectible card game that implicit social contracts are required for friends to have fun playing.  That is, you need to release more cards every three months.  They need to be good, so people who have already bought cards in the past will buy more.  Eventually, you reach some critical mass of cards where people who are dedicated enough can find and 'collect' certain cards such that they win the game in unfun ways (like the guy says in the article, it's easy to win).  There's no provided rules for what 'casual' play means, or even for deciding what it means for a given group.<br/><br/>It used to be unthinkable to turn the implicit competition of a game like D&amp;D into explicit competition without ruining everyone's good time.  But <i>Agon</i>, to take a single example, does just that.  Are card games missing the analysis and re-analysis that for RPGs resulted in things like open, fair, fun competition?  Or am I just not aware that there's another forum in some far-flung corner of the intertubes that is us or the forge, but about card games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71244/#Comment_71244" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T22:23:57+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 10:23PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2007 10:32PM by Eric.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the linked article:<br/><i>"You can win, sure. But for most casual players, a game full of people who go all-out all the time means that it stagnates quickly. Mix it up a little."</i><br/><br/>This statement is utterly baffling to me. To me, Magic stagnates the moment people stop playing to win, so the opposite notion makes no sense to me.<br/> <br/>Also, this sounds like sheer madness to me:<br/><i>"But the best way that I've found is to tell people flat-out when things are a little cheesy. As an example, someone asked me the other day, "So you run Vintage-legal lists? That's a little worrying. What's stopping me from going nuts with my crazy combo?"<br/><br/>"You can do it," I said calmly. "And if you do it enough, we won't want to play with you. So that's up to you.""</i><br/><br/>Right, I mean, the best way to make a competitive game fun is to make it less competitive. Also, imposing such a vague restriction is a wonderful policy in a game where it's so easy to be specific with a ban list.<br/><br/>Honestly, the whole notion of "okay, you can win all the time, so long as you do it with shitty decks" or "you can dominate every 3rd match so long as you throw the other two" sounds a lot like "we should find a different game to play on Tuesdays, because this Magic thing isn't actually working out for us."<br/><br/>Edit: I just realized that the article is almost pure marketing. Specifically, the whole "money imbalances" section seems really sketchy coming from a guy who runs a singles site. Here's an idea: if one guy has, like, no cards, don't tell him which cards to buy; just let him make proxies. Easy. Now the playing field is level again, it took very little time, and nobody spent any money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71335/#Comment_71335" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T07:19:03+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  7:19AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ummm.... Eric, not to contradict your own preferences, but I know exactly the thing that's going on with not playing to win. Many casual groups have a variant winning condition. The winner is the person who comes up with the most "cool" (unexpected, funny, i-can't-believe-that-actually-works...) deck. In order for most "cool" decks to work, they need a less competitive environment - because a lot of the most <i>interesting</i> things you can do in the decision space of a CCG aren't the most <i>effective</i>.<br/><br/>For an RPG analog, consider the common knock on optimized characters in D&amp;D - that there is a degenerate strategy available, and therefore everybody should play a cleric or druid built according to a particular set of specs, because that's the most mechanically effective build. It's arguably true, yet this does not actually happen. Why? Because in most functional Gamist D&amp;D groups, the actual winning condition is not "My character pwnz yoo" but "<b>we</b>. together, win against the monsters, and each of us gets to contribute to winning in a unique and cool way."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71344/#Comment_71344" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T07:45:00+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  7:45AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for clarification's sake, the linked article isn't really talking about creative agenda.

That's cool."<br/><br/>When I play Magic I often have fun but sometimes things get very ugly and nasty and I don't like that. Many times, for example, people play decks that stop you from doing everything (removing all your land, going into a slow infinite combo that you have to wait an hour to lose to, etc.). The linked article, to me, is talking about a central piece of the Forge play aspect, which asks you to pay attention to what kind of fun people besides you are having, and to try to figure out ways that your fun and their fun can be mutually reinforced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71350/#Comment_71350" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T07:53:49+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  7:53AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand both sentiments.

Again, in <i>Agon</i>, people play to win, to the limits of their ability, against the Game master and each other, and fun results of both the competitive and cool-being sorts.

He just obliterated anything that wasn't specifically an anti-red deck. Any time he wanted to play with that deck, it was like, "Oh well. As long as we can play with something else next, because playing against that deck is a waste of my time."<br/><br/>There's another interesting discussion of <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20060519a" rel="nofollow">"D&amp;D rules as nuclear weapons"</a> that was a little bizarre, but helped me realize how I wanted <i>my</i> games to work.

But the local scene was resolutely social-play-dominant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71650/#Comment_71650" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T09:45:59+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  9:45AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As somebody who played Magic pretty much only as a beer n' pretzels game (I got out of playing before there really were tournaments and such, like less than a year after it came out), I can sympathize with the notion of not playing it as balls out competitive. I think there's a place for that, don't get me wrong. Might even be the best use for MTG overall. But it's just fine as a friendly game where we try to temper each other's decks so that it's fun to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's like... "Yeah, you beat me with that deck, and I don't have a counter for it. Now why don't you try some other deck so that we can actually compete again with some of the decks I have. I wonder if the decks I have made up are good against anything? Heck, I didn't really plan them out all that well, and just want to play with what I've got and not worry so much about construction, and just have fun playing."<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, that's actually what made me stop playing MTG, because game-play is pretty damn straightforward and it's all about deck construction. Often we'd just make random decks and see how well you could do with what you came up with. That was often far more fun than trying to see who could come up with the best deck.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that I think that with any game, there are those people who are into it to really see how well they can do, and others for whom it's no more competitive than, say, playing Parchesi. Each is valid. No, you don't have to "mix it up" as the guy suggests - he's basically just pushing his own agenda here. But for the right group, there's nothing wrong with "Play nice" as part of the contract.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71652/#Comment_71652" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T09:49:58+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  9:49AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,\n<blockquote>I mean, that's actually what made me stop playing MTG, because game-play is pretty damn straightforward and it's all about deck construction.

On the one hand you have casual players, no dictionary, and a general rule that you can only use words that everybody has heard of - sometimes enforced by raised eyebrows or subtle mutterings. On the other hand, you have memorization of the 2-letter word list, obscure vowel-less words that can be found only in the Official Scrabble Dictionary, and playing to block out sections of the board rather than open them up.<br>\n<br/>\nIf you have a game with people from both categories, it's not going to be fun for anyone.
