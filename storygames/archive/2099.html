                    OK, so this is following up from a separate topic raised in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2069&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>Are there really no RPGs for the Mainstream?</b></a>, a spin-off by Shreyas and Eric Provost.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>My hypothesis is that this is because authority in OUAT<em>matters.</em>You might need to plant a subplot way in the beginning of the game to get your endgame to come off right - it takes a bit of planning to finish a story off with "When father saw her babies he knew he hd to allow the marriage." Whereas, with a game like D&amp;D, your narration doesn't matter; it's not authoritative or even informational to the other players. Everything that matters is embedded in the miniatures game.Consequently, these games where narration is weak and insignificant actually cause narration atrophy, because one can be much more effective in the minis game if one's attention is not divided by this other thing that matters not at all.So, like, there need to be constraints, but they have to encompass some power, or the kids will just not play in that sandbox.</blockquote>
Well, I think that in a archetypical D&amp;D dungeon crawl, the players described actions are extremely important.  The players completely control the pacing, for example.  Further, their choices are critical to the outcome, and can mean doom or victory for the party.  <br/><br/>I think partly this may be a clash of terms.  I use narration in the literary sense of described action.  So, for example, within a book if there appear the words, "And then Sir Tirnal drew his sword and tried to open the door" -- that is narration, aka narrated action.  So even a pure miniatures game has narration insofar as people use words to say what is happening (as opposed to moving pieces on the board).  <br/><br/>Now, the narration in D&amp;D is highly constrained, I agree.  It is far more constrained than in [u]Once Upon A Time[/u], for example.  But narration can be highly constrained and yet still meaningful.  However, I think I agree with Shreyas that the constrained narration of a dungeon crawl isn't necessarily important in learning less-constrained narrational games like OUAT.                </div>

                            I think that Shreyas is speaking of narration in terms of "description of things that happen in-game" rather than "Decisons made about what my character does."<br/>
<br/>
For instance,<br/>
<br/>
GM: "Which way do you go, right or left?"<br/>
Player: "Left."<br/>
<br/>
Is not narration for this purpose. I think this because the example Shreyas gave was that of the description of a sword. That is, a D&amp;D player can narrate, "My character's sword is called Frostbane by him, and it shimmers white," but that has no effect on the outcome of the mechanics. Whereas in another game, the player could tag that description somehow, and it would, in fact, have mechanical weight.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying he's right or wrong. Just trying to help get the argument straight. Though Shreyas may well now say I've got it completely wrong, too.<br/>

Yeah, what JD said.  I understand that you have a different definition, but what you're saying makes no sense -- since what characters do are part of what happens within the fiction.  For most fiction, what characters choose to do is a big part of the fiction.  <br><br>I guess there would be a specific question would be: Is anything which characters say or try to do not considered part of narration?  Or could it be narration if you describe what an NPC does?  (i.e. "The king approves of the plan.")                        </br></br></div>

                            I think John was talking about the same field too. I know I was. In an action game, actions are significant decisions. It matters whether Jackie Chan punched the big bad or hit him on the head with a ladder, if the point of the movie is cool kung fu fights.                        </div>

I don't see how that changes things, since the meaningful narration by the players also involves meaningful decisions.  <br><br>So, in a railroaded adventure, then I agree that there are few meaningful decisions by the players.  For example, a Deadlands adventure which has a pre-written sequence of scenes.  However, a decent location-based adventure isn't like that.  It is non-linear, putting the pacing and direction into the hands of the players.                        </br></br></div>

                            Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think narration means here (in this thread) creating fiction that doesn't describe the actions of a character. Hence, it can not mean decisions of the character.<br>
<br>
In DnD, any narration made by a player except the GM is meaningless, since it can only be color. Describing the belongings or thoughts of a character (etc.) has no mechanical reward and narrating events is the exclusive right of the GM. Non-GM narration is near to non-existent in DnD, how the hell would it be meaningful then? I think  it's not the way it's meant to be played.                        </br></br></div>

                            [Edited to note the cross-post with Adam, who seems to be getting it.]<br/>
<br/>
John, saying that going left or right is meaningful in such a game, doesn't make the description of the sword meaningful. What Shreyas is saying is that, yes, a player can dictate decisions about play that are meaningful in the sense that the game is, effectively, a miniatures game. That includes things like whether to go left or right - where you move your mini. It doesn't include any description of any other element of the game that's not related to the game as a miniatures game.<br/>
<br/>
You could say that choosing to buy Park Place in Monopoly is narration. But it seems to lack that explorative element that we assign to RPGs. "Narration" as colorful description of the in-game events. It's really about giving power to things like plot and color. Can the player affect the plot? Can his colorful description have a mechanical effect? If not, then he'll ignore those things.<br/>
<br/>
And this seems to match most, say, D&amp;D play that one sees. Instead of saying, "I bring my sword down in a circular loping chop, intended to take his head off" the player will tend to say, "I attack. Rolled a 18. I hit. 9 Damage."<br/>
<br/>
That is, because there's no mechanical empowerment to create in-game events other than by use of these sorts of miniatures mechanics (including moving your character), you tend to get lackluster narration. When you have empowerment, you get more compelling narration.<br/>
<br/>
Or at least I think that's his theory.<br/>

                            Are we including in-character dialogue in this thing called narration? If we are, the original assumption seems to be very weird. If we are not, that's cool, but leaves a kind of narrow area to what it applies to - which is also cool, but also applies to the mentioned area. Sure, in some games everything that matters is encaplsulated in what's called "miniature game", since by definition they don't support players narrating stuff that changes the fiction outside the actions of characters. Saying that narration of character actions is not meaningfull is off the mark, though; they might not matter a lot in your archetypical D&amp;D dungeon crawl which could or could not be a fully mechanical exercise and based on actions resolved by the rules. They matter a lot in some other cases, where the characters are explored through the mentioned dialogue and narration of character actions. <br><br>The images of characters are constantly updated in the players minds, as they explore both their own and other players characters, not to mention other things in the fiction. Wheter these narrations have anything to do with mechanics is not necessarily irrelevant, but not very relevant either, or at least I've missed games that put relevance to them through the use of rules.<br><br>I'm kind of put off by terms like "miniature games" since most of the stuff happening at the table is not dictated by mechanics, but is very relevant to the experience itself. In some cases, fundamental, and in some other cases, less so.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            My urge to make a passive agressive response has lead me to have to re-write this post several times. There's nothing in the world so infuriating as somebody who says that others should read charitably, and then does not do so themselves.<br/>
<br/>
John, will it help if I say that you win on the point about narration? That your definition is right, and that what I was saying makes no sense? Can we then move on to the issue at hand, or forever bury this discussion at the bottom of a lake where it belongs?<br/>
<br/>
Here's the point: Games like D&amp;D produce crap narration in terms of it having high amouts of evocative in-game color description, and its because of the mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
You say "constrained" I say "crap." To-may-to To-mah-to. We agree, just not neccessarily on the aesthetic call.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that's a nice as I can be right now.<br/>

                            John, my impression is that we're talking about the difference between <i>description</i> and <i>direction</i>. <br><br>What you're talking about is "direction"; "The king approves," "I choose the door on the left," or "I aim for its head."<br><br>What Mike and Shreyas are talking about is "description"; "My sword is Glambring, the foe-hammer," "I make sure that the sheriff sees the scalps on my saddlebags," or "We thank the spirit of the Great Bear for allowing us to use its skull as shelter."<br><br>The latter involves a lot of color, detail, and context. The former is focused solely on dictating actions. In, e.g., D&amp;D, the latter are all irrelevant 99% of the time, as there are no mechanical bits that give any of them inherent meaning. Any meaning needs to be added on by the players at the table, so if they're not actively working at this, there's little incentive to add those descriptive flourishes.<br><br>I see this all the time in the multiple D&amp;D campaigns I play. In one of my groups, a couple of us call it "dinner theater." It's something we endure, as it's never, never, ever relevant to what happens when dice are actually being rolled.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Oh, if mechanics are all that we're talking about, sure.

I'm a bit loss at there; why are we comparing the ends of spectrum - the playing style, and games, which advocates player narration and is built upon it, and a game which, like you said, is pretty much aimed to be a mechanical exercise in fiction created by an adventure module or GM? The only purpose that I can think of is...
<blockquote>That's what rules like D&amp;D tend to facilitate mechanically. Any cool narration done during any such game is done<em>despite</em>the mechanics.</blockquote>
... This. I'm sure we can proceed into examining how the fact that D&amp;D and a lot of it's offspring did not take narration (in wide, dialogue-including sense) into account and let it happen despite the mechanics, which then has had several effects. One of them, obviously, is empowering player narration into fiction outside the character and rewarding it through mechanics.<br><br>I'm trying to keep my passive-aggressiveness in check and kindly suggest that it's one effect, but that there are plenty of other effects which have very little to do with player narration as stated earlier, and are as meaningfull. Though, such comparision sounds like apples and oranges to me.                        </br></br></div>

                            Mark, I think that you're getting at some of the essence of the underlying structures that are in question, but that's at the danger of prolonging this thread. That is, narration as "Stuff Shreyas likes to see in play" can be the functional definition here. As such, JD, can you see the POV?<br/>
<br/>
Frankly I think Shreyas is out in left field with his whole "RPGs should be pretty art" aesthetic. I like a good miniatures game myself (play Warhammer all the time, and don't mind games like D&amp;D at times). But that's what he wants, and he's just saying that some sytems don't provide it. Which really seems non-problematic.<br/>
<br/>
If John's only point is that things people say in D&amp;D make matter in a D&amp;D way, well one could hardly argue against that, and it's just a restatement of Shreyas' point from another POV.<br/>

Thanks for your efforts.  And for what it's worth, I agree that D&amp;D produces crappy narration in terms of it having high amounts of evocative in-game color description.  Or more simply put, D&amp;D narration isn't colorful.  At least, my experiences match with D&amp;D match your comment about people simply saying things like "I attack".  <br><br>However, I don't think that damns all possible constrained narration as meaningless.  <br><br>I think that narration constrained in different ways can be enormously evocative.  For example, Puppetland is even more constrained from D&amp;D where what you say is always what your character says and you attempt actions by implying them in what you say ("I hit you, you filthy brute!  Take that!").  I think that Puppetland is enormously evocative.<br><br><i>Edited to add: I missed a bunch of replies when sending this since Mike's quoted post.</i> </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

If you're talking about LARP, I'm sure Shreyas wasn't considering it at all. But knowing him, I'd guess that he wouldn't like that sort of "narration" either.<br/>

If you keep reading it to mean that this sort of "narration" has no meaning to anyone anywhere, you'll keep going around in circles.<br/>

As for a counter-example, take a game like Feng Shui, which at least has a rule that says that if you say the same description of an action in combat you get penalized, and that you get bonuses for creative narration.

Well, as I've been trying to clarify from the first reply to this thread, the term meaningless here was used in a very specific application. "Meaningless for this application, and in this way."<br/>
<br/>
Could Shreyas have been clearer? I think he was plenty clear, I got him from word one. It seems to me that only somebody thinking he has some sort of hidden agenda would think otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
But let's just call it a misunderstanding then, eh?<br/>

Fair enough.  However, especially if Shreyas doesn't want to talk here, then I don't know how far we can go with exploring that definition.

I'm working from memory here, but doesn't <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feng Shui</span> ignore narration mechanically?  As I remember it, it simply suggests that there are no penalties for however you describe your attack -- so shooting while dive-rolling over the hedges is the same as shooting while standing still.  The idea was that as long as it wasn't penalized, then players would naturally go for the more colorful options.  Examples of mechanical effects would be something like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Over the Edge</span> which suggests penalties for repetitive or boring descriptions, or bonuses for clever descriptions like surprise maneuver in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Champions</span> and various later games.                        </div>

I'd be very suprised if a lot of the D&amp;D players don't end up doing in-character dialogue and character action narration that affects the play, a lot. For example, let's take a typical example of Yer Grumpy Dwarf and Pointy Ear Elf getting into argument about ages old racial mistrust in the classic tolkienesque sense. And then the elf getting into a tricky situation and Dwarf saying "he's as queer as they come", and letting him to survive in his own. That's a simple example of rather powerfull use of what John is calling, I think, constrained narration. It only empowers players (outside the constraints of their characters) if they are using characters as extensions of players being mean to each other.<br><br>I don't see D&amp;D supporting this mechanically, but I see it having a huge impact on the experience. Now, you can tell me that this does not happen in most D&amp;D games around there and I'm inclined to believe you, since I haven't played D&amp;D with half of the TTRPG players, or at all for that matter. But I do hear it happening a lot with D&amp;D players I know.<br><br>Playing D&amp;D just as a miniature game without miniatures (or with them, especially nowadays) seems to be like being in the end of the spectrum. The game certainly advocates this. But colour me suprised if players don't do narration by just doing stuff outside the mechanics and it affecting the experience.<br><br>And yes, I can see how reward mechanics in Feng Shui are mechanically different. I'm just not buing the argument that lack of such mechanics would somehow just exterminate the existence of creative narration with the mentioned constaints. I am seeing how getting the narration without the constaints can be hard, though.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br>I'm working from memory here, but doesn't<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feng Shui</span>ignore narration mechanically?  As I remember it, it simply suggests that there are no penalties for however you describe your attack -- so shooting while dive-rolling over the hedges is the same as shooting while standing still.  The idea was that as long as it wasn't penalized, then players would naturally go for the more colorful options. </br></blockquote>
No. Feng Shui has a -2 penalty for anything boring, which includes giving no description at all. Cool narration has no penalty. This is the reverse of the "usual" way of doing things, which gives a bonus for narration and no penalty for no narration, but works out the same in the end. Also, -2 is a very large modifier in Feng Shui -- against an equal opponent, it will halve your chance of success.                        </div>

I'm not sure anyone is saying that. I think all we have here is, as Mike is saying if I understand him, is System Does Matter. If the system doesn't encourage X, X is less likely to happen. Sure, you can get as flowery as you want to with a system like D&amp;D, but IME, it never lasts. The minute you recognize that the game will proceed without the descriptive effort, you start giving up. And that's okay, because you just want your damn XP already. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>Ergo, Shreyas needs to stay away from D&amp;D.                        </br></br></div>

If we are talking about System as the whole-what-happens-at-the-table-and-not-only-the-mechanics, then yes, I agree. But if we are building a hypothesis that meaningfull narration (again, in the wide, constrained sense) does not happen without the mechanics supporting it, I disagree. Yeah, it's less likely to happen and there probably are lot's of groups that can't make it happen or want to play D&amp;D or whatever as a race for XP - but that's a bit of a moot point.<br><br>I'm not entirely digesting the giving up -argument, either. Groups tend to come up with house rules if they're not satisfied with mechanics as they are, and other conventions (House Systems?) if the game does not support stuff that's not dictated by the mechanics, and they want that stuff. Granted, a lot of roleplaying games suck at supporting narration, constrained or not.                        </br></br></div>

                            I'm probably conflating the Feng Shui rule with the OTE rule as they're both written by Robin Laws, IIRC (guest starring in OTE here). And actually it's a pretty weak example. I just didn't want to have to reach for, say, PTA fan mail, which is pretty much all about rewarding nifty plot or narration, or Sorcerer bonus dice, etc. The point is that such mechanics exist in RPGs, and tend to reinforce the sort of narration that Shreyas is looking for.<br/>
<br/>
It's been decades since I played with a caller, and I could be recalling the rules incorrectly (though I think that "convey" implies a whole mess of stuff that has to be ironed out by tradition). But the end effect was the same. I mean it wasn't until like three years into playing RPGs that any of us even considered speaking in character - or even playing a "character" at all instead of a pawn. I started doing it first, and my players thought I had gone crazy somehow. I don't know how to emphasize better that, at the time, RPG meant "one-player-to-one-individual-unit-wargaming" to most people playing. Took a long time for Gygax's odd ideas to sink in round some parts. In fact there are many places today that ignore the mechanical incentives to "roleplay" when playing D&amp;D today. I have a friend who runs just such a game weekly.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, lots of D&amp;D groups probably do have first person narration these days and lots of stuff like that. Maybe most, I don't know. Sometimes, in fact, leveraged off of creative uses of the "roleplaying" award idea (in third edition this seems to be even stronger). But that's still either game mechanics, or player tradition at work promoting it. Not it coming about because the rules don't say to do it.<br/>

                            There's a whole other topic here of what to do when your narration sucks either objectively ("For Christ's sake JDCorley I don't understand what the fuck you're talking about.") or subjectively ("Jesus JDCorley, we get that your character is a twat, you don't have to beat us over the head with it!!").<br><br>D&amp;D combat narration is interesting (and a LOT different from most other trad combat systems out there) because the individual decisions don't typically have much color to them, but <i>in sum</i> it is something much more. In other words, if I ask someone to tell me about the last D&amp;D fight they were in, they don't say, "I swung and missed, he swung and hit, I tried a trip attack and hit but didn't trip him, blahblah blah", they summarize: "The guy was tough, I had a hard time connecting...then I started trying to trip him and that threw him off his stride. By the time I was done he was flat on his back begging to surrender." That's cool pro-from-dover talk to me. But again, see the subjective content evaluation above. To a lot of people that's just as boring as "I swing, I miss, I swing, I hit..."<br><br>Hey, I think there was a thread somewhere back there before I took this turn and went down this road, anyone know the way back?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Re: callers in dungeoncrawls</p>
<p>I don't remember whether 1st edition AD&amp;D or any other D&amp;D rules stated clearly how much power a caller had (in other words, did the caller decide, or convey decisions?) It may have been vague in the text.</p>
<p>However, in <strong>The Fantasy Trip</strong>, it was explicitely stated that the caller/party leader said what the other party members were doing, but each player could opt to disobey the caller. We never played with a caller, however, and I have no idea how common that was.</p>
