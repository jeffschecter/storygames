If you happen to run across this at your LGS or at your local comic store, I recommend that you pick it up. Knights of the Dinner Table is really quite brilliant the way it captures old school, antagonistic, powergamer play and takes it to its extreme logical limits. It's beautifully encapsulated in this compilation, where the party earns a hyper-powerful bag of holding and proceed to exploit its potential within the framework of the rules.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288596/#Comment_288596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T19:42:45+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  7:42PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2010 11:52AM by johnzo.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am SO buying this. <br/><br/>I think the Bag Wars arc was the absolute zenith of the comic.  It hooked me on the Knights, transforming them from a laughably dysfunctional table of buffoons into a group that I seriously doubt I'd be elite enough to play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288613/#Comment_288613" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T23:15:08+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 11:15PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's great about Bag Wars is that it depicted the kind of inevitable amazing logic that came out of emergent play with the same group in the same setting for extremely long campaigns.  It depicted it with comedy, but there have also been dramatic and even romantic moments that I've seen in such campaigns. Awesome stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288642/#Comment_288642" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T04:53:08+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  4:53AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, for all the gamers who don't get traditional play or what immersion is, this book presents a pretty good picture.  This is about as "coherent" as it gets! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The whole Gary Jackson document concept is so cool.  There is also just an anarchic spirit to the comic that reminds me the old underground comics of the 60s and 70s (which was something that attracted me to D&amp;D back in the day).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288730/#Comment_288730" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T09:47:51+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  9:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love KODT. I dont think I've ever missed an issue, although I dont have the Bag Wars book yet. (Is there much that wasn't in the monthly comics?)<br/><br/>Also, I realize that the dynamic is supposed to be that of an old-school GM-is-in-charge D&amp;D game, taken to a humorous extreme (the Hackmaster rules, GM accreditation, the RPG company settling disputes between groups, etc).  But ... you can read it as the KODT players being super-committed story gamers. They're constantly referencing events that took place "offstage", and, like good improv-ers, they never deny or contradict one another. <br/><br/>Like, Bob says "I can't fight that bouncer! I lost my helmet in Hagley Town!" and Dave says "Oh yeah, that little girl who stole your helmet. She was mean." They do that stuff all the time, describing scenes we haven't seen. <br/><br/>I submit that they didn't play these scenes out, they're just inventing them on the spot to fill in narrative back-story. TOTAL HIPPIE GAMERS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
