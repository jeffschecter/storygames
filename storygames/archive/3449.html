We looked around at various alternate hosts, and I found a few that I really liked, particularly one whose name escapes me now.<br/><br/>I spent like an hour searching my Gmail account emails for that info, but I'm afraid I've forgotten who I was talking to, and can't find the list of hosts we were looking at (basically a dedicated virtualized server rather than a dedicated stand-alone; there was a well-regarded but generally expensive host that was of particular interest).<br/><br/>Anyway, if that was you, whisper me!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
