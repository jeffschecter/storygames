I would like my players to have the chance for world building!<br/>We once made it with Dresden Files and we had lots of fun. Are there any guidelines on how to boost creativity? I don't want to be stumped after everyone has chosen their bonds. Are there some lists with example questions out there?<br/><br/>2. Preparation for the 1st session<br/>I know it says not to prepare a plot in advance but I'm a bit afraid that I won't know what to do after chargen. Any tips on how to handle that?<br/>Should I go for a preplanned adventure (I have bought Within Devil's Reach, just to be sure)? What if my players have created a world which doesn't work with my prep then?<br/>Or would it be enough to have a rough plot idea and to flesh out some NPCs with motivations and monsters so that I don't have to look up their stats? <br/><br/>Any help is greatly appreciated!<br/><br/>(Please excuse any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398505/#Comment_398505" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T08:24:17+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  8:24AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some adventures on the DW website: <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/category/bonus/adventures/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dungeon-world.com/category/bonus/adventures/</a><br/><br/>Also, if your players like world/history building, I found Microscope to be great fun and I think it would work for creating a setting as a group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398508/#Comment_398508" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T08:51:50+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  8:51AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I summon <a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a> to the thread. <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=4996.0" rel="nofollow">Also, this</a>.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/3Jane">@3Jane</a>, I haven't been to the Dungeon World site in a while.

Procedures are WAY better. (Guidelines are vague wishy washy advice that may or may not apply, procedures are clear and straightforward.)\n<blockquote>2.

I found it was a bit vague in places and left some big gaps, so I'd read it over carefully before the game to make sure you know which areas you'll need to improvise in.<br/><br/>I'd say don't worry about world creation too much. Flesh out a bit of stuff before you play, but you want to leave plenty of room to explore as things go. Don't feel like you need everything defined in advance. Just ask a few questions about who the characters are and where they're from and go from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398511/#Comment_398511" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T10:41:35+00:00" title="November 23, 2012 10:41AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I summon <a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a> to the thread. <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=4996.0" rel="nofollow">Also, this</a>.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/3Jane">@3Jane</a>, I haven't been to the Dungeon World site in a while.

It's primarily a set of starting points -- lots of your questions will snowball off of their answers.<br/><br/>For reference, I didn't write these, I just pulled them off of a forum post of Noofy's and threw it on dropbox.  <br/><br/><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13355093/Extended%20Character%20Concept%20Generator%20bankuei.docx" rel="nofollow">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13355093/Extended%20Character%20Concept%20Generator%20bankuei.docx</a><br/><br/>The above is bankuei's extended character concept generator -- this has overlapping ideas with the set of questions above.  <br/><br/>Anyway, either of those should be a decent jumping off point.

There is no need to spend hours worrying where the mountain ranges are or what clan hates who (unless you really care about that). <br/>You can just start with: "You're on the run (from whom?) because you've just stolen (what? why?). As you dive from roof to roof a chasm opens up in front of you, what do you do?" (stealing from the other DW thread!)<br/><br/>This is easier because it focuses on the now and survival. The character sheets have lots of stuff that supports this directly. Then you can ask questions to fill out what is going on, as they escape (or not!). IMO that's more fun.<br/><br/>The AW games and this community have really opened my eyes to these possibilities!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398649/#Comment_398649" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T12:22:16+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 12:22PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider me paged!
