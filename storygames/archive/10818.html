I had a game idea more-or-less ready for <i>Dust Devils</i>, but Thomas suggested we do it as <i>Dread </i>instead.<br/><br/>So! I threw together 3 questionnaires, making liberal use of the sample questions in the book, adding questions to reinforce the time and place (a little silver mining town in post-Civil War, pre-statehood Colorado called Wolf Gulch), and strewing red herrings liberally! My game idea was set up so that the players were meant to think that wolves -- or possible werewolves -- stole a baby, with a big reveal at the end that the wolves were actually trying to help by leading the players to the otherwise untraceable river demon who was actually responsible.<br/><br/>As per usual, <i>Dread </i>was quick-paced and the teetering tower kept things tense. The fact that we were all partaking of the delightful <a href="http://www.bigrockbeer.com/corporate/press.php?pressId=20091013" rel="nofollow">Big Rock Winter Spice Strong Ale</a> let people really cut loose and get into character, and certainly didn't help the stability of the tower.<br/><br/>What I learned:<br/><br/>1) You actually CAN throw together 3 <i>Dread </i> questionnaires in a brief span, if you kinda already know what you want. Still, if I'd had more time, I would've been able to tailor the questions a little better. A lot of info on the sheets never came into play at all, although it did definitely help everyone figure out their character motivations.<br/>2) People will go directions you will <i>not</i> expect with their answers! One of the characters, having read his questions and seen my werewolf mis-leads, made his character a possible werewolf with his answers.<br/>3) <i>Dread </i>is a great little Halloween game.<br/><br/>Anybody else play any holiday-themed games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
