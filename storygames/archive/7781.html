We started a PTA season and it was just screamingly good.  My Monday group have mostly played a PTA one-shot or two but this was the first time we've committed to a full season.  PTA has many dialects, and we're playing "Jason style", which means I did a little research up front and declared the general setting.    So:<br/><br/>The Big Store (That's what Mafiya goons call America) is set in Brighton Beach in 1990, just before the Gulf War, after the introduction of Windows 3.0, as the Soviet Union disintegrates.  The protagonists are Russian emigres involved in organized crime.  They are, in fact, a group of losers known as "the Potato Bag Gang" working for mobster who has broken away from the Organizatsiya, the Jewish-Russian mob in America.  <br/><br/>Misha Sokolov is a quick-witted and largely assimilated cab driver.  Issue:  "Ambitious - it's our turn."<br/>Oleg Koslov is a defector who was spit out by the US government and now sells trinkets.  Issue:  "Broken hearted"<br/>Grisha Berezin is an Afghan War veteran with an eye patch and a deep love for America.  Issue:  "Self control"<br/>Ilya Pirogov is a wet-behind-the-ears newcomer sent to America to keep out of trouble.  Issue:  "Redemption"<br/>Yakov is a by-the-book mob soldier and tattoo artist whose entire family is Americanized.  Issue:  "Hates America"<br/>Vassili Lavrov is a retired enforcer from the old country who wants no trouble.  Issue:  "The Past"<br/><br/>We tied everybody together - Ilya is Lavrov's nephew and lives with him.  Misha and Grisha are both from Gomel and knew each other growing up.  Ilya and Yakov are similarly bonded (I forget how).  <br/><br/>I ran the pilot pretty traditionally, aggressively framing scenes and intercutting two (and later three) storylines.  Toward the end, once everybody had the hang of how the conflicts are organized, we opened it up a bit, and going forward I think it'll be straight PTA scene framing.  <br/><br/>So two threads:  The first had Misha and Grisha tasked with picking up Vyacheslav Lyubarksy, a jewel thief who owed their boss money from gambling debts.  Lyubarsky was under the protection of the mainline Organizatsiya, so they had to recover him, which involved a failed conflict and a beating for Grisha out in front of Gastronom Odessa.  Once they had him, he persuaded them to trade some uncut stones for his life - he knew their boss would cap him.  Where does he keep his stones?  With his good friend Lavrov, of course.  Joel, playing Lavrov, orchestrated a wonderful scene where they negotiated for Lyubarksy's life.  They ended up giving their boss the stones, letting Lyubarsky go, and having Lavrov (who has a great reputation) smooth things over.<br/><br/>The second had Yakov and Ilya tapped to assist the gang's scariest enforcer, Emile Puzyretsky, by guarding a door behind which he performed some mysterious beat-down.  They were jumped by rival hooligans, failed a conflict, and were run off, leaving Puzyretsky to his fate.  This was especially awesome because he'd given his own gun, a gaudy gold-plated .45 - to Ilya, who had none.  So they abandoned him to die and ran off.  <br/><br/>This gave me a great opportunity to introduce Oleg, who was selling Soviet trinkets on a blanket somewhere when Emile Puzyretsky hobbled up, a bullet wound in his thigh.  The enforcer tossed him a wad of hundred dollar bills and told him to get him to a hospital.   Various conflicts later Puzyretsky had decided Oleg was his fast friend, and was going to set him up as a made man, much to Oleg's consternation.  But how does one refuse a guy who has killed 100 men and disarticulates corpses with a linoleum knife in his tub?<br/><br/>The final scene was Emile Puzyretsky tracking down the guys who cut him loose, which ended up with all the protagonists (except the old man, Lavrov) in the back room of Chicken Masters restaurant in Coney Island.  We had a wonderful conflict about how his revenge would be exacted, and Yakov, the good soldier, ended up assuming all the blame.  Forced to name his own punishment, he decided to tattoo COWARD across his own hand.  Fan mail flowed.<br/><br/>We ended with a very satisfying round of "Next week on..." which includes such gems as "Oleg's initiation kill" and "Grisha chases his glass eye".  Basing everything on reality (Puzyretsky is real, as are all the other characters they interacted with, as are all the locations they found themselves in) really seemed to click.  I had a ton of fun and everyone seemed really engaged and having a good time.  Our crappy Russian accents are the best.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173133/#Comment_173133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T02:17:50+00:00" title="October  4, 2008  2:17AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I really wish i was playing in this game.

Right off the bat, the guy playing Yakov said "I hate America.  My family is obsessed with celebrity.  My nemesis is Mickey Roarke."<br/><br/>Which, of course, is fucking perfect.  In 1990 there was a certain dangerous cachet to slumming with the noveau riche Russian mobsters, and their gaudy clubs (Rasputin, Odessa) were hot night spots for a while.  So we set it up that the actor latched onto Yakov as his "guide to the underworld", and thinks they are buddies, and Yakov is mortified.  Of course it'll get a lot worse than that.  Taylor Dayne is also showing up.<br/><br/>And soundtrack:  Yes, the guy playing Grisha studies Russian and is putting together a soundtrack for us, equal parts tea-room balalaika, Eurotrash disco and Russian gangsta rap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173163/#Comment_173163" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T07:08:41+00:00" title="October  4, 2008  7:08AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>I am really intrigued by the idea of doing research for a game.<br/><br/>Could you describe how the info you take in is given to the players?<br/><br/>Do you create hand-outs or just give them an overview while making characters?<br/><br/>After seeing some of the behind the scenes stuff in Deadwood, seeing how much the writer/producer researched that era, this kind of approach appeals to both the gaming geek and the library student in me.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173173/#Comment_173173" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T07:48:36+00:00" title="October  4, 2008  7:48AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2008 7:52AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Judd,<br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/big_store/combined_play_aids_big_store.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's what I put together</a>.  I sent this around before we got together for the pilot, and it's got some of my ideas for antagonists and prominent NPCs on it as well as stuff for people to grab in play as needed.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/big_store/rmap_russians.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's an R-Map after the pilot</a>.  Most of these relationships are real and come from Robert Friedman's book<i> Red Mafiya</i>.  I just read it and took notes.  The wikipedia articles on many of these guys, as well as the Vor V Zakone, were also helpful.  I also read Anne Applebaum's book Gulag recently, and a book on Russian criminal tattoos.  So it was sort of casual research, nothing too strenuous or methodical, and now that the game's started nothing is sacred.  This is approach is definitely library school damage!  I didn't used to do it!<br/><br/>I should also point out that this is a huge cloud of data, not all of which makes it into actual play - in the pilot they interacted with exactly two NPCs on that R-Map.  The rest, at this point, are just background information and color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174263/#Comment_174263" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T05:54:36+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  5:54AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2008 7:29AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night was episode one of The Big Store.  It was Misha's spotlight episode, and his issue is "Ambition".  We did some interesting stuff.  <br/><br/>First up, Steve as Misha framed a high-stakes card game in which he was the most junior player, staked by his friend and using Vassili's name as his bona-fide.  There were heavy hitters from the Organizatsiya, the Genovese family, and ... him.  We started that game and then played most of the session as a series of flashbacks, discovering how he got into the game and who was really there - at some point we discovered that Micky Rourke was also playing, which was excellent.  I established that Yakov and Ilya had been tapped to do some dirty work earlier in the evening, and they were at the card game as muscle, so I telegraphed a bit about their job by describing them as disheveled and sort of haunted-looking.  What the hell had they done?  It amped up the tension, and playing with time was effective and fun.<br/><br/>Turns out their sociopathic boss, Emile Puzyretsky, gave them some marching orders that morning:<br/><br/>1.  Go find Oleg and bring him along.<br/>2.  Buy ten liters of hydrofluoronic acid and some handcuffs.<br/>3.  Meet him at a dry cleaning business on Avenue X.<br/><br/>So, you know, that went well.  Oleg, who doesn't even want to be in the game, was somewhat reluctant to torture the owner of the cleaners into signing away his assets, but business is business, right?  It was a very disturbing scene.  Yakov had been humiliated earlier in the session by the gang's supreme boss and took out his rage on the guy who didn't want to pay protection money.  The best best best bit - they didn't know where to buy handcuffs, so they went to a sex shop and ended up with pink-fur-trimmed "prisoner of love" cuffs.<br/><br/>Other cool stuff:  Ilya, who is gay, made his first connections in the Brighton Beach gay subculture.  Misha won the poker game, earned the unholy wrath of Biba Nayfeld, usurper of the Organizatsiya, and managed to survive the evening.  Mickey Rourke punched <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Yakov </span> Grisha in the face.  Emile found poor, innocent Oleg after the protection/torture caper, and tossed him 20 grand in cash, promising more to come, and a chance for the lonely sap to bring his family to America.  Vassili, "retired", was drawn deeper back into the game by defending Misha from Biba.  The noose tightened - it was awesome.  A two-parter is up next, with the Issues of Redemption and Self Control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174266/#Comment_174266" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T06:16:01+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  6:16AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something else that highlights the really cool collaborative dynamic of PTA:  So the old dry cleaner guy is pleading for his life.

I didn't think much about it, just trying to humanize him a little to see where that would lead with the soft-hearted Oleg.  I imagined a pair of cute little girls tucked away in Park Slope.  <br/><br/>Then at the end of the session, Scott says "That dry cleaner had two daughters, right?  And he didn't want to pay protection money, right?  One of his daughters is a New York District Attorney."<br/><br/>And, you know, ZAM!

The two mobs are poised for a war that the Zilber gang (and the protagonists) cannot win.  Biba himself paid Ilya's aunt Marfa a friendly visit, inquiring after her health.  She begged the boy to do something, because people like Biba don't just drop by with the best of intentions.  So this eighteen year old gay kid promises her he'll take care of it.  Later he hooks up again with Leo Slutsky, who is a genuinely nice guy and not in the life at all, and they become sort of boyfriends.  It's a sweet moment, with a wonderful conflict over how much Leo knows.  Nothing, it turns out.  Innocent as a lamb.  They kiss on the boardwalk.  Ilya resolves to leave the life, but first he has to take care of Biba.  He's maddened by the thought of his aunt in danger.<br><br>Meanwhile Grisha, who has thusfar been a hapless loser in all things, watches his world further crumble.  His American girlfriend Melanie, who already humiliated him by macking on Mickey Rourke, seduces his best buddy Misha and has some manner of sordid sex-type activity with him in his taxi.  Grisha picks up a Russian girl (the nurse of his brain-damaged uber-boss, Zilber) named Xenia and she begs him to take her to Club Odessa - enemy territory.  He does, it does not go well, and he is further humiliated by Biba himself.  He vows masculine revenge.<br/><br/>So we're primed for two parallel stories of misbegotten action, and we cut back and forth between them for the rest of the evening.  Independently, Ilya and Grisha set the course for catastrophic war in Brighton Beach.<br/><br/>Grisha and Misha have it out and end up pals again, after Misha agrees to be the wheel man for Grisha's next foolish scheme.  Grisha ejects all but two rounds from his Glock as they pull up around the corner from the Odessa.<br/><br/>Ilya enlists Yakov - the group's only true soldier - to break into Biba's house and assassinate him when he returns that morning.  They break into his palatial house and set up in his living room.<br/><br/>Grisha, under a full moon, rounds the corner and walks purposefully up to the two Organizatsiya thugs at the Odessa door who have caused him so much pain.<br/><br/>Ilya hears a noise - a heavy footfall, then the racking of a pump shotgun.  "Run!" he shouts to Yakov.  Yakov bolts like a rabbit.  There's a conflict, the producer utterly owns, and Yakov is blown through a window, nearly killed.  It's Boris, the psychopathic brother of Biba, standing there in his underwear with flat affect going on, like the wood chipper guy in Fargo.<br/><br/>Grisha says not a word.  Two head shots, one in each of the two soldiers.  They drop like slaughtered beasts.  One is dead and the other nearly so.  <br/><br/>Ilya and Boris face off.  Boris sizes him up and realizes Ilya is soft, no threat, he doesn't have the sand to shoot him.  He smiles.  Ilya raises his gun, hand shaking, and sort of accidentally shoots Boris in the face.  He blinds him, shatters a cheekbone, and gets the fuck out of there, taking Yakov to the hospital.  <br/><br/>So the war is on.  Ilya's made his choice (he never really had one).  So has Grisha, who is now totally out of control.  <br/><br/>When Ilya gets home, he finds out his uncle (Lavrov, played by Joel in a brilliant and note-perfect turn) was visited by Leo Slutsky, who told him they were lovers, and who was beaten within an inch of his life by the rabidly homophobic ex-mobster.  Things are utterly fucked up and it's going great.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175160/#Comment_175160" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T06:43:29+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  6:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some PTA notes - we had a conversation about supporting the screen presence 3 people before play and it really helped - almost every scene was about these two guys and the world of shit they were creating for themselves.  <br/><br/>It turns out we've been playing slightly wrong!

It was Lavrov's spotlight episode and the old man got worked over emotionally.  He's 63; he's married to a nice American Jewish woman, he wants out of the game.  So far he's stayed out.  <br/><br/>We started with a flashback - Moscow, 1966.  Lavrov's Vor partner calls on him - an enemy has been released from the Zone and has already mutilated one of their confederates.  He's too powerful to take down right away and they need to go into hiding.  Lavrov's not buying it - he wants to go crush the guy head-on.  We establish that he's a stone cold bad-ass who takes the code of the Vor very seriously.  Joel, playing Lavrov, is scary intense.  <br/><br/>Flash ahead to 1990, St. Vincent's hospital, where Yakov lies with shotgun injuries to his posterior.  There's a cop guarding his door but they know that won't stop Biba and the Oranizatsiya from coming to kill him.  The war is on, and Zilber's mob - the formerly laughable Potato Bag Gang - is either going to step up and finish the job or they are going to all die, along with their families.  To make it happen they need Lavrov, and there's a battle to persuade him to fight.  Finally he agrees, fooling himself that it'll be "one last time".  There's some awesome back and forth with Emile Puzyretsky, who mocks the old man and gets slapped for his trouble, and takes it.  Things are tense.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile Misha is thinking ahead - organizing his little band of cabbies and mafiya couriers to keep an eye on the Organizatsiya and telegraph their moves, and getting access to an abandoned fun house on Coney Island.  Grisha, who murdered a guy and maybe two the previous night, checks in with his police contact in the 60th precinct to see what's up - the cops are clueless but know there's some kind of Russian mob beef going on.  They think the Italians killed the Odessa dudes.  Ilya, humiliated and outed by his uncle, mans up and plays the hard guy, confronting Lavrov and getting a beat-down for his trouble.  Things are tense.  They need the whole crew if they are going to survive.  First up - pulling Yakov out of the hospital.<br/><br/>I set up a scene where Yakov, in pain, calls for a nurse.  Too late he realizes she's talking to him in Russian - it is Xenia, Zilber's nurse, who has switched sides and is pumping him full of fentanyl for Biba and the Organizatsiya.  When the protagonists get to St. Vincent's, he is already gone.  They have a satisfying confrontation in public with Biba and his goons, and then vow to get Yakov back before a furious Biba tortures and murders him.  Things are seriously crazy.<br/><br/>Yakov wakes up to find Mickey Rourke at his side.  Biba's brought the actor by as a final humiliation for Yakov, who hates the actor.  Rourke thinks the Organizatsiya people are Yakov's friends, and there's a cool scene where Yakov begs him to alert Lavrov to his location before Biba carves him up with a linoleum knife.  Mickey Rourke finally gets the hint and rushes to Club Rasputin (Zilber's home base) to alert the good guys.  But the only guy there is Grisha, who hates him, and there's some more excellent interplay.  Eventually they assemble and prepare to raid the hotel where Yakov is being kept. <br/><br/>There's a big jump-cut series of scenes as they break into teams and bust into the hotel, commanded by Lavrov.  Ilya proves his toughness by breaking an Organizatsiya thug's fingers one by one.  Grisha goes apeshit on the room's guards, cycling his AK-47 full auto and killing a bystander.    Two guys bust through a window and there's a blood-bath - Biba's shot in the head, the two thugs are killed, and Yakov, from his bed, executes Xenia as she begs for mercy.  It was insane.  Five dead in fifteen seconds.  The game just tilted into very dark territory.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile Misha's got the getaway vehicles idling, and on the radio his couriers inform him that a bunch of Organizatsiya goons are headed for Lavrov's apartment on Mermaid Avenue.  There's a fun chase as Misha leads the arriving cops away from Lavrov.  Misha and Emile Puzyretsky end up arrested.  <br/><br/>Lavrov gets home in time to find two Organizatsiya thugs and a 60th precinct cop dousing his apartment with kerosene, his wife and two boys tied to a couch.  The Issue conflict is clear - his family is in the balance.  One outcome has his family safe and him deeply, permanently back in the game , and the other has him free and clear and burying everyone he ever loved.  We fight it out and Joel wins.  He wants to save the innocents.  He beats the cop to death with his bare hands.<br/><br/>So everything has gone utterly to hell, but they've basically dismantled the Organizatsiya.  Nine dead, two crippled.  Next week we'll find out whether Lavrov is taking Biba's place or not.  On our "next on", we also saw Yakov back in Russia, meeting some important people, and an assistant DA handing <i>someone </i>a wire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175896/#Comment_175896" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T06:01:56+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  6:01AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2008 6:52AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some game play notes - I abducted Yakov to provide some focus and tension.  The players were sort of planning an ambush where they'd draw the bad guys to them, and I pre-empted that because it seemed too passive.  I'm not sure if this was a good move in retrospect - it turned out fine, but it feels like I stole their thunder a little bit.  Everybody was OK with it but it may have been some inelegant producing.  <br/><br/>It was really fun to see existing relationships called back and heightened.  I kept looking at our massive R-map and just calling people in.  Yakov's nemesis <i>had </i>to enter the scene where he was helpless.  The fact that Mickey Rourke has bad blood with Grisha meant that <i>of course</i> Grisha was the only guy there when he showed up at the Rasputin.  The Organizatsiya needed a nurse to dope Yakov?  <i>Of course</i> they'd bought Xenia.  In many ways PTA is an easy game to run.<br/><br/>Looking ahead, one of the two guys that Grisha shot - the one who died - is best buddies with Monya Elson (his former bodyguard, actually), who is the baddest motherfucker in the Vor world and whose arrival in Brighton Beach will be the focus of season two.

First the fiction:<br/><br/>It's Yakov's spotlight episode.  Issue:  Hates America.  Everything is fucked up as the protagonists have hollowed out the Organizatsiya. They go after the money-men, the guys who keep the books and collect the krisha ("the roof" - protection money).  It's all about consolidating the business under new management - theirs.  <br/><br/>Misha is in the Manhattan Detention Center and gets a visit from the assistant DA and a guy from the FBI.  They want him to roll over on Puzyretsky, who is very dirty, but he basically laughs at them.  <br/><br/>Ilya tries to make nice with his lover, who was beaten up by his uncle Lavrov, but the poor guy just tells him to fuck off.   It's a painful moment.<br/><br/>Grisha, now the proprietor of the Odessa night club, macks on Taylor Dayne and is basically in ignorant mobster heaven.  There's a great scene where the fellas get the drop on Igor Roizman, the money-man for the Organizatsiya, who is being guarded by Gintis, the Organizatsiya soldier that Grisha shot but  <i>didn't</i> kill.  Grisha shot him in the head, now he can't speak and has a palsied gun hand.  He's a useless mess and they are very cruel to him.  Grisha demonstrates that he has no conscience at all. <br/><br/>Word gets to them through their dirty NYPD contact and representatives of the Genovese family that the "reformed" Organizatsiya, now staffed by the protagonists, needs to come up with somebody to take the fall for the crime wave and the cop killing.  Porotsky, their boss, tells them to decide among themselves which of them is going to fall on his sword in the Vor tradition, going to jail for life.  The portagonists do the math and decide that the best outcome is to set up Porotsky for the fall instead, selling him to the feds and putting Lavrov in his place.  This complicates Misha's life in jail, because Puzyretsky is Porotsky's right-hand enforcer.  It becomes his job to kill Puzyretsky in the MDC, which is awesome.<br/><br/>Misha ingratiates himself with a white power gang in the prison as both muscle and protection.  The killing will be attempted next week.<br/><br/>Yakov is tapped to escort a hundred million dollar currency shipment to Moscow.  Before he leaves, he's grabbed by the FBI who threaten to deport his grandma if he doesn't wear a wire to help their case against a Chechen arms dealer.  He laughs in their face.  I am totally deporting his grandma next week.  Anyway, Yakov makes it to Moscow and visits Monya Elson at his creepy dacha in the birch forest.  It turns out Monya is through with the code of the Vor, he's all about America and entrepreneurship, he loves America, he can't wait to come over to Brighton Beach to run things.  Yakov, ever loyal, promises to help him while hating him for shattering the code.  Season two will be all about Monya's arrival in the USA.<br/><br/>The episode ends with Ilya ratting out the protagonist's plan to Porotsky, selling his uncle out.  Unfortunately, Porotsky refuses to believe it.  We all agree that Ilya is a dead man.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/big_store/rmap_russians_ep4.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bonkers new R-Map</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176772/#Comment_176772" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T05:40:17+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  5:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This wasn't our best episode - it was more of a taking stock and setting things up session, very chatty and conflict-light.  My goal was to ramp up external pressure from the DA and FBI, get somebody to play ball, but I didn't have the mojo to make it happen without forcing it into a conflict against the players wishes.  <br/><br/>We were missing the guy who plays Lavrov, who should have been central this week, so that was awkward.  There were a number of really interesting sub-plots that stole a little focus from Yakov's spotlight episode, and his issue (hates America) is a little weak.  So it went OK, and I think we all had fun, but it wasn't stellar.  Also the guy who plays Oleg finally told us that he wasn't digging the content and didn't want to play any more.  Next week was to be his spotlight episode, so we'll make it a season-ending pilot instead, putting everybody at 2 screen presence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177285/#Comment_177285" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T11:00:13+00:00" title="November  4, 2008 11:00AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finally got around to reading this (I thought "The Big Store" was a show about a giant Wal-mart or something).<br/><br/>Anyway, wow.

Turns out it does!  Our group is unfortunately a little amorphous, with people having actual lives and so forth, so we rarely play with the entire six protagonists.  We've had to make a couple adjustments to Screen Presence and episode structure to handle that.  Also, one guy (my brother, actually, playing Oleg), decided to drop out of the season because he wasn't comfortable with the content.  Se we're actually five protagonists.<br/><br/>As Producer I'm usually rocking 23 Budget, give or take.  We move through scenes at a brisk clip, and I've been very relaxed about framing duties.  It helps to reinforce that every scene really needs to be Issue-focused, and that everyone ought to be supporting the guy with 3 Screen Presence.  So far, so good.  Next week is the season finale and was supposed to be Oleg's spotlight episode, so we're giving everybody Screen Presence 2 and wrapping up as many threads as we can.  I think it'll be great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177293/#Comment_177293" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T12:04:17+00:00" title="November  4, 2008 12:04PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really love the way you've worked history into the game.

Porotsky turns his attention to Grisha, and laughingly tells how Ilya tried to convince him that they are all plotting to kill him. Grisha assures him that this isn't true, and wins Porotsky's trust, and Emile Puzretsky's golden pistol as a gift for his loyalty.<br><br/>At the Manhattan Detention Complex, Misha asks for Emile's help against the Aryan 88, who he says have threatened him. Emile promises his help, one Vor to another. The set up begins as expected, but when Emile realizes Misha has betrayed him, he savagely overcomes his attackers and turns on his comrade, demanding to know who ordered it. Misha, his heart never in the betrayal, reveals the plot against Igor Porotsky.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ilya has arranged a meeting with District Attorney Pavlik. They talk in her car in the alley behind her father's store, Friendly Cleaners, and Ilya agrees to wear a wire and get evidence against Porotsky in exchange for protection.<br/><br/>Next we see Lavrov sitting in Chicken Masters, remembering long-gone days when he stood with Ilya's parents at the boy's circumcision. Monya Elson was also there, and had agreed to be Ilya's godfather at Lavrov's request. In the midst of these thoughts, Lavrov was suprised to see Ilya enter Chicken Masters. They talk and Ilya tells him of Grisha and Yakov's plans to betray Porotsky and make Lavrov the boss. Lavrov tries to convince Ilya to get away and save himself, and the two make amends.<br/><br/>Misha and Yakov visit Officer Turner of the 60th precinct, to see if he would accept Porotsky as the fall guy for the recent unpleasantness. Turner violently objects, refusing to bite the hand that feeds him his payoff money. He asks for Lavrov instead. A short time later, at the Odessa, Lavrov comes to them incensed at their plans. Yakov tells him that his old friend Monya has abandoned the code of the Vor and that only Lavrov can lead them now.<br/><br/>Grisha and Yakov, angry at Ilya's troublemaking, go to find him at Chicken Masters. They argue and struggle, and in doing so find the wire. They throw him in the car and head for New Jersey, with the police not far behind. Driving through the woods, Yakov interrogates Ilya and threatens his aunt Marfa, which causes Ilya to grab the wheel and wreck the car. leaping out, he grabs an AK-47 from the trunk. In the snowy wilderness, Grisha and Ilya face off against each other- they shoot, Ilya falls dead and Grisha is badly wounded.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Lavrov, tired and sad, visits Misha in jail. They talk of the plot, and how everything has fallen apart. Why should they go on doing what they do? They talk about how all of them are guilty of violating the code, and that it's not just about the money. In the end, Misha shows Lavrov that it's about honor, and that the old man is the only one capable of showing everyone how to run the Organizatsiya with honor.<br/><br/>The next evening, at the Rasputin, Lavrov comes to Porotsky. Lavrov is reinvigorated, resolved to set things right. He tells Porotsky that they both know he is not fit to lead, and that he will stand tall for the good of the Organizatsiya. Porotsky starts to get angry, but sees the cold in Lavrov's eyes and crumbles. Lavrov then sends Yakov to deal with Zilber and the bodyguard, Yuri. Yakov strangles Yuri, but begins to feel a darkness growing within him.<br/><br/>In the closing scenes, we see someone approaching an industrial dryer at Friendly Cleaners, tumbling steadily with Ilya's body inside. And at the airport, a private plane touches down and Monya Elson exits, finally arriving at the Big Store.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177672/#Comment_177672" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T08:27:39+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  8:27AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Steve!<br/><br/>One very satisfying thing for me is that everyone is terrified of Monya.

I painted Monya as a cold-blooded lunatic and I think they are nervous.  We'll pick up season II in January and the fault lines are in place - Lavrov cannot accept a back-sliding Vor like Monya and Monya can't accept any opposition from below.

Starting a second season is both easier and harder - it's easier because you've got established characters, and it is fun to take them in new directions.  It's harder because you have the weight of history, so to speak - many complex events that are already part of the tale.  And unlike real history, in-game establishment is really important.  <br/><br/>Example of the former:  Last season Grisha killed his best friend Ilya, who had ratted the Organizatsiya out to the District Attorney.  Now he's a little cracked, has a Connection to the dead Ilya, and often seeks his advice on important matters, staring for hours into the industrial dryer where they once stuffed his corpse.  Having Ilya's ghost as a character in the game is fucking great.  It's going to drive the entire season.<br/><br/>Example of the latter:  Greg needed a new connection.  What about Oleg Z, Monya's bodyguard?  Great!  Monya's going to be important this season.  Wait a minute, no, Grisha shot Oleg Z in episode 3 last season.  Or was it Gintis?  Which one is the brain-damaged guy and which one is dead?  Oh, forget it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188546/#Comment_188546" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T17:52:07+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  5:52PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.

I did the homework, building up the framework of a setting (I read the book <i>Red Mafiya</i>, basically) and then just let everybody find a place for themselves within it.  Once we started play it rapidly found a collective voice, and I had little to do with that - it was all driven by PTA Issues and good ideas at the table.  Having a detailed R-map was nice, because it gave all of us an easy reference for applying pressure and introducing new stuff to destabilize the situation. Having lists of names and actual businesses has proven really helpful too - now we're at a point where we've latched onto a handful that are personal sets - Chicken Masters,  Gastronome Odessa, and Friendly Cleaners - and are branching out this season even more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188962/#Comment_188962" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T05:47:01+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  5:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apologies if you explained this and I missed it, but what does the shading mean on the relationship map?<br/><br/>How much have you run PTA otherwise incidentally?

If this game were written up and released then doubtless people would feel the need to graft a magic system onto it and have Vor-wannabes hunt down monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188977/#Comment_188977" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T07:23:19+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  7:23AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The relationship map is an interesting tool there Jonathan, in something like your Te Deum game I could see that adding value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188987/#Comment_188987" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T07:52:55+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  7:52AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually have one in my head.<br/><br/>Writing it down and giving it to you would probably make my madness a touch clearer but while I've been rather patchy on many details of the setting (largely because I'm not buying a book about Le Havre purely in order to get the geography of the place right), the flow of power has always been something very central to my conception of the game world.

I'll do a new one after Wednesday night's session, because it's changed a lot.  There is no Zilber mob, for instance.<br/><br/>I've run a few one-shots,  a two-season story with another group of players, and played some at conventions.  <br/><br/>My Wednesday night crew has some guys who also play more traditional games (L5R, D&amp;D) and we are all very much into The Shadow of Yesterday and up for a one-shot of anything.  That said, I had to do a little arm-twisting to get them to try a full season of second edition PTA (we'd played with dice and it wasn't spectacular).  I think everybody is really loving it now, though.  <br/><br/>As for realism, I don't know.  It's like a TV show.  There's a lot of gunplay and not a lot of falsifying gasoline excise tax records, you know?  Brighton Beach in 90-91 was apparently a lot like the Wild West, so maybe we're being perfectly accurate.  One of my goals for season 2 (which I'm not producing) is to make sure that all the chickens come home to roost.  Grisha killed Ilya, who was a snitch, but also the Godson of the uber-boss, Monya, and the nephew of Lavrov, another protagonist.  My new guy is pushing hard to see that come to light.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189512/#Comment_189512" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T05:32:55+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  5:32AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/big_store/rmap_russians_season2_ep1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's the revised R-Map</a> after episode one.  I included some stuff that hasn't been touched on (like the Goldberg gang) to spur ideas.  Episode one was pretty kickass - Grisha, in the spotlight, went over completely, surrendering to his own delusions.  His guilty conscience, as manifested by the whispering ghost of Ilya, is leading him to drive wedges between himself and anybody who could possibly save him.  He's totally doomed.    There's a new Italian gang in town that is eager to eat the Russian's lunch, and so far they have been unstoppable.  It doesn't help that mysterious forces within the District Attorney's office have been feeding false information to foment a war between the Organizatsiya and the Genovese crime family.  <br/><br/>One nice thing this season is that the protagonists are a bit more spread out - we've got a cop on the take as well as Vor at three different levels within the hierarchy, instead of a bunch of equals.<br/><br/>We're trying to play season two by the rules as written, which has resulted in some confusing conflicts as we carefully parse the rules.    It hasn't been bad, and they really are good rules that we drifted in counterproductive ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[PTA] The Big Store - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7781/pta-the-big-store/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[PTA] The Big Store - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7781/pta-the-big-store/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Nice.

Yakov wants to resolve a problem and implicate Grisha.  Grisha wants the opposite.  They both win.  The way we were playing, that wasn't possible, and now that it is it is leading to some really interesting situations.  I think this is the biggest positive change.  Telling the Producer what you want and letting him frame it has created some fun surprises, and to be honest we don't always do this - sometimes a player will just have a really strong idea and we run with it.  And the tie thing isn't a major difference, but we never got it down and would do it a different jackass way every week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190507/#Comment_190507" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T05:42:45+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  5:42AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much of last night's action took place in Florida, where the Brighton Beach Vor were making deals with Ludwig "Tarzan" Fainberg to get some backup in the rapidly escalating war with the Italians in Brooklyn.  I think the very best scene took place in Disneyworld, in the Haunted Mansion, in a Doom Buggy, where Grisha took the opportunity to tell Misha he knew he was a snitch, and that he would be killed (Misha is, of course, totally innocent).  Now Grisha's off his rocker and is being periodically advised by the ghost of his old friend Ilya, and of <i>course </i>when the ride gets to that point where there's a hologram that shows a passenger in your buggy, Ilya shows up, nodding his approval.  It was really nice.  The contrast of these vicious Slavic gangsters in sun-drenched funtown was really fantastic.  <br/><br/>A technical note - we arbitrarily lengthened our season from 5 to 6 episodes, and it is causing some problems.  Matt built the game for 5 and 9 episode seasons and those work best, go figure.  Dividing up Screen Presence 111223 seems to be suboptimal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192212/#Comment_192212" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T05:32:38+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  5:32AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2009 5:40AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We missed a week but we soldier on.<br/><br/>Last night was episode 3, my spotlight episode, and I chewed it up.  I play Ivan the Bitch, who is an agent of chaos in the lives of the recurring characters.  He came over with the new uber-boss, Monya, as his toady, and he's the only guy Monya truly trusts.  Like his boss, Ivan's all about the go-go business end of the Mafiya and has open disdain for the old ways - honor, loyalty, the code of the Vor.  This puts him in immediate conflict with most of the protagonists. We had two really intense conflicts, and I had the chance to lay it all out - I humiliated old Lavrov, ostensibly my direct superior, by taking control of a retaliatory attack on the Italians he was organizing, and I had a face-off with Misha, my subordinate, who is competent in all the ways my guy is not, and who I approached with profound disrespect.  The only conflict I actually won all night (!) was the one with Lavrov, which has some serious implications for me - I had a reapproachment with Misha and learned that he's not a useless monkey, and I exposed myself to Monya's terrible wrath by vouching for the Organizatsiya's flaky bookkeeper, Igor.  It was a session stuffed with change and transformation and it just flew by.<br/><br/>After producing the first season, I approached the game as a player with an eye toward amplifying weak spots in the power structure and providing contrast.  Since everyone was playing a guy who clung to the old ways to good effect, I created a protagonist who dismissed the old ways as outmoded nonsense.  Since the recurring protagonists have no connection to their new boss, I played a guy who was his "left hand man".  This contrast has provided a lot of dynamic tension and fun play.  Last night was where it all got put on the table after weeks of low screen presence and vague hints.  <br/><br/>Another beautiful scene - last episode, the Organizatsiya had given up Yakov (Greg's protagonist) to the Italians as "payment" for a bad mistake we made that got some of their soldiers killed.  Yakov's good friend Joey Pagano drove him out into the Pine Barrens to kill him.  Nothing personal.  We know Yakov can't really die but nobody knows how he's going to get out of it.  A gun battle?  A wrestling match?  Turning Joey?  They all sounded a little lame.  So Scott buys into the scene and has his corrupt cop, Jimmy Millbrook, roll up in his Honda Civic.  He's in deep with the Italians and knew it was going down, and also knows Yakov's been cast off by the Mafiya and can tell him stuff he needs to know.  Millbrook wants him alive.  So he says hey, gets out a ticket book, and writes them both pissant misdemeanor tickets, way out of his jurisdiction, for littering and a broken tail light.  Fixing them together in time and space and saving Yakov for another day without any heroics.  It was utterly sweet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192214/#Comment_192214" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T05:48:00+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  5:48AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also interesting to me that this season has seen almost no change in the R-Map at all.  Last season I updated after every episode and things were flying around; this season it's almost static.  We framed the first season as the gang's ascendancy to power and now things are pretty stable.  I anticipate some seismic shifts in the next few sessions, though - Lavrov cannot tolerate Monya running things, he just can't.

I don't know if that is really due to the extra episode or just that my spotlight is at the end and I've got a steady build to that point.  In any case, things should start kicking off for Misha next week.<br/><br/>The scene with Detective Millbrook interrupting the execution was awesome.  For the record, the great outcome was the result of both PCs failing in the conflict- Millbrook's player wanted to shoot the Italian, and Yakov wanted to get away.  Since they both failed, we had to get creative.<br/><br/>Another nice bit was where we had a scene take place in the same time and location as the previous scene, but from a different angle.  In the first, loose-cannon Grisha did a drive by on the Italians.  In the second, Detective Millbrook was staking out the Italians and talking to the D.A. in his car.  After they finished being distracted with their own personal conflict, they had to watch as Grisha took his shots and sped away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192219/#Comment_192219" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T06:05:03+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  6:05AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I forgot about that - somebody suggested we set the scene with Millbrook and the DA immediately before a scene we'd already done, in the same location.

I can't even keep it all straight, really - Detective Millbrook (in the spotlight this week) is beholden to the shadowy and terrifying Boris Nayfeld, who is working for the west coast gangsters who are trying to muscle the Mafiya out of Brighton Beach.  He's also got a hate-on for our own mountain of Vor pride Lavrov, and strong-armed Yakov into wearing a wire, at the behest of the DA, in hopes of bringing down the whole mess.  Yakov stood tall but Lavrov screwed up on the wire, he's in hot water, some Genovese family guys died, Yakov's macking on Millbrook's ex-wife Sadie, it is a gigantic clusterfuck of awesome.  The old gang is falling apart and there's nothing but chaos and treachery to replace it.<br/><br/>Here's an interesting PTA-ism:  Conflict is always uncertain.  My guy, Ivan, has been nipping at Lavrov's heels all season, trying to paint him as hopelessly old skool and no longer relevant, even though he is ostensibly my boss.  Last week I sort of humiliated him, and my very first scene this episode I asked for our mutual boss, Monya, to call us on the carpet.  I wanted Lavrov knocked down a peg or two - I wanted to eat his lunch and thought I had the mojo to do it.  I goaded him into a blind rage and Lavrov attacked Ivan, and wham!  Conflict!  I knew that if I won Lavrov's old heart would begin acting up again and he'd be unable to follow through, old and weak.  But I lost, and Lavrov beat the crap out of Ivan while Monya praised this "return of the old Lavrov I know so well".  It defined both our character arcs - suddenly the old dog is ascendent and Ivan is a simpering nobody, working the edges, on the way out.  It was perfect and a really cool segue into next week, when Lavrov is Screen presence 3.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195577/#Comment_195577" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T04:53:22+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  4:53AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shazam!  Last night was the second-to-last episode, and crusty old conflicted Lavrov was in the spotlight.  Joel plays this guy brilliantly - he's an old man, he's the original gangster who did twenty years in the Zone, he's tough as nails but exhausted, and he's deeply, deeply conflicted.  He's broken the Vor code - he is married and he loves his estranged wife.  And he wants out - that's his issue, with two season's worth of pressure building.  Last week we tried to set up a crazy situation for him with our "Next Week On...":<br/><br/>- Millbrook and his partner find surprises in Spoonflower's trunk as sirens approach<br/>- Nayfeld opening a case of cash for Misha<br/>- Tina talking to Misha about taking over for Lavrov<br/>- Judith driving a car with Nayfeld as her passenger<br/>- Igor the accountant going over the books with Lavrov - "I don't understand, we should be making ten times what we are!"<br/>- Yakov in a trial before the Vor leadership, including Lavrov <br/><br/>So there was some juicy stuff to work with, as well as some scenes to help set up Misha's episode, the season's last, next week.  Not all of this happened - the guy playing Millbrook had to bow out, so he was barely a factor tonight, which was a shame.  We pimped him into a later scene, where he was tricked into helping Lavrov, the guy who murdered his partner in season one.  The continuity and backstory that develops over multiple seasons is so satisfying!<br/><br/>In the end we discovered that Lavrov had been playing the Organizatsiya, waiting for his moment - he'd siphoned millions to an account in the Caymans, and last night he pulled the trigger on his plan.  He killed the accountant and made a run for it, and through an extraordinary series of conflicts, managed to leave town with his shaken wife Judith.  The arch enemy of the entire series, Boris Nayfeld, was gunned down like a dog.  We were all a little surprised that Lavrov lived.  Next week he's screen presence 2, so he'll be back, and this time i think he's going down.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing - Yakov was banished by the Vor tribunal.  This is basically a death sentence, since pretty much every gangster on the east coast wants him dead.  He's been frozen out, and is hiding.  It occurred to me that his story would be a fantastic spin-off, where he goes to ground and runs a gas station somewhere in the midwest, builds a life, fights off assassins and repays old debts while maintaining a good-guy image.  Sort of a cross between Burn Notice and A History of Violence.  <br/><br/>We had a surprising number of scenes where the Prodcuer beat everybody, which was a little unsatisfying.  I think this was just random, though.  It did lead to some weird and unexpected scenes, but also a few that felt sorta flat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201385/#Comment_201385" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T07:06:53+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  7:06AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2009 7:09AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last episode of season 2 was last night, after weeks and weeks of fuckups and cancellations.  We finally got it together and it was a good ending to a wild season.  Things went dark - of the six protagonists, one is in jail for life, two are dead, one is either dead or has a career-ending brain injury, and two are out in the cold, one irrevocably crazy and the other a friendless bag-man for the Italians.  So no happy endings.  <br/><br/>The money Lavrov stole was never recovered, although he paid for it with his life.  The Organizatsiya is poised to fall like a house of cards - the Mafiya hegemony in Brighton Beach is over.  Detective Millbrook fell on his sword for his naive partner, who moved to Cincinnati (Deep in the Blue: Bond Hill is also broadcast on MBS).  If The Big Store were to have a season 3, it'd be a very different show.  <br/><br/>We did have some problems with <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9104" rel="nofollow">binary conflicts</a>, but we sorted them out.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend multi-season play of PTA enough!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7781/pta-the-big-store" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7781/pta-the-big-store" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7781/pta-the-big-store/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7781%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7781%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
