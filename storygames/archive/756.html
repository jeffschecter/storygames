<p>So, going through my cookbooks, I've been separating them into reference texts and teaching texts. It's interesting to see what changes the difference brings to bear on the form, whether it's deliberate or not; Nigella Lawson's written at least one book, <em>How to Eat</em>, that I consider teaching, and its recipes are ensconced in discussions of techniques and variations, as well as less-obvious things like the timing issues of menu planning; it's actually a fairly good way to gain some basic kitchen competence from a basis of none (provided someone teaches you how to respect a knife.)</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Forever Summer</em> is much more reference-like; even though the tone does not change and each recipe is still a personal story, it doesn't dwell on technical aspects, beyond the necessities for communicating the recipe's preparation.</p>
<p>I've pretty much failed to find this distinction in roleplaying games, whether between texts or in parts of a text; I'd expect at least part of the D&amp;D3 Player's Handbook to be obviously a teaching text, but it's pretty much an index of "what you need to know to make a character" organised in an arbitrary way.</p>
<p>So, I'm trying to figure out, what games have good examples of teaching text? What can we learn from non-rpg sources written to teach? (Should I get <em>D&amp;D For Dummies</em> and compare it with my PHB?)</p>
