I think I have it, but I need to know if its broken:<br/>\nCharacters are made of Traits, Traits are divided into 7 categories:<br/>\n1) Superpowers (This is a Trait with the Power Tag and Super Tag and at least one other Arena Tag - i.e., Physical, Mental or Social).<br/>\n2) Powers (This is a Trait with the Power Tag and at least one Arena Tag) - Powers differ from Super Powers in that they cannot always be brought into play in a conflict in its Arena (sometimes you are not strong enough to overcome that physical challenge). While Super Powers can always be used to overcome challenges in their Arena.<br/>\n3) Abilities (Abilities only have the Ability Tag). Abilities fall into the realm of human potential. They impact challenges, but not on the same scale as Powers or Super Powers.<br/>\n4) Standard Traits (These have no Tags). Standard Traits have no mechanical weight and are simply used to define your character in terms other than kewl powerz.<br/>\n5) Marks (A Mark only has the Mark Tag). A Mark is a weakness that can be applied to any arena of conflict. This represents an aspect of human weakness that can be overcome with effort (Such as Mark of Greed or Mark of Witlessness).<br/>\n6) Weaknesses (This will have the Weakness Tag and at least one Arena Tag) a Weakness will impair your progress in its Arena most of the time. These are extraordinary weaknesses that require special care to overcome, like Batman's reliance on a Utility Belt.<br/>\n7) Super Weakness (This is a Trait with the Weakness Tag, the Super Tag and at least one Arena Tag). This is a catastrophically bad weakness. It will almost always come into play in conflicts in this arena and will be nearly impossible to overcome. Think of Samuel L Jackson's character in Unbreakable when you want to imagine a Super Weakness with a Physical Arena Tag.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, there is not list of Traits, just come up with a Trait and assign it Tags. For instance Deceptive could be a Super Weakness, Weakness, Mark, Standard Trait, Ability, Power or Super Power. Its up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, based on that introduction, Chargen is as follows:<br/>\nHave a complete character design in mind, then do the following:<br/>\nSelect 3 Arena Tags for Powers and/or Super Powers. In order to get a Super Power you must spend at least 2 of these Tags (one for Super and one for each Arena)<br/>\nSelect 3 Abilities<br/>\nSelect 3 Standard Traits<br/>\nSelect 1 Mark<br/>\nSelect one Arena Tag for Weaknesses. In order to get a Super Weakness you must spend at least 2 of these Tags (one for Super and one for each Arena)<br/>\nYou can get extra Abilities by selecting extra Marks (on a one-for-one basis)<br/>\nYou can get extra Tags for Powers by selecting extra Tags for Weaknesses (on a one-for-one basis)<br/>\n<br/>\nEpiphany: Describe the moment when your character decided to use their powers to make the world a better place.<br/>\n<br/>\nNemesis: Using the same chargen system as above, design a super villain for the GM to play. You can give him more power tagds without giving him more weaknesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrit: Players start with 3, this number is modified by the following:<br/>\nEvery Power with a Super Tag: -1<br/>\nEvery Weakness Tag: +1<br/>\nEvery Power with a Super Tag that the Nemesis has: +1<br/>\nEvery Weakness Tag: -1<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are done!<br/>\n  And all of this (except for Standard Traits) feeds directly into the Resolution mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:<br/>\nSteve Forester<br/>\nIce powers (Super, Power, Physical)<br/>\nTotal recall (Power, Mental)<br/>\nCharming (Ability)<br/>\nQuick (Ability)<br/>\nThorough (Ability)<br/>\nLikes people<br/>\nDoesn't like attention<br/>\nImpulsive<br/>\nMark of the Soft touch (Mark)<br/>\nCan never trust again (Weakness, Social)<br/>\nGrit: 3 (3-1+1+1-1)<br/>\n<br/>\nInferno<br/>\nHeat ray (Super,Power, Physical)<br/>\nHot body (Power, Social)<br/>\nInstinct (Ability)<br/>\nDaring (Ability)<br/>\nMethodical (Ability)<br/>\nManic<br/>\nNarcissist<br/>\nDriven<br/>\nMark of Greed (Mark)<br/>\nSuper predictable (Weakness, Mental)<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, what I need from you is broken characters. What that means is, they have to fit two criteria:<br/>\n1) You would want to play this character (so yes, you could make a character with the power to make saran wrap opaque, but would you want to play that character?)<br/>\n2) You would not want to GM in a game that featured that player character.<br/>\n  What have you got?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156273/#Comment_156273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T22:55:23+00:00" title="July 12, 2008 10:55PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2008 10:55PM by PaulCzege.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Dave,<br/><br/>Okay, I'll play.

I can make a character I'd want to run, but not GM for, and then you make me make the antagonist, and by doing so I solve most of the problems I'd have with GMing for the character.

What do you think, could you handle them?<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure I got the Grit calculation right.

For instance, if a psychic power does some kind of damage, it is Physical, unless it causes brain damage or some how impairs your ability to learn, notice or figure things out, right?<br/>\n - Social: Charming, Barter, Leadership, Seduction, Willpower, Performance<br/>\n  And if a Trait has an Arena Tag, that means that Trait can only be used in a Challenge that is in that Arena.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, in your example:<br/>\n - He Knows What You Know (Super, Power, Mental) works exactly like you would expect it to and because it has the Super Tag works as well as you wold expect it to. I don't think this really breaks the game. You could use this power to change the world and it would have little or no chance to fail to solve smaller problems, right?<br/>\n - He's Never Where Your Hostility Thinks He Is (Power, Mental) . But, this can only be used in a mental challenge, a riddle, disarming a bomb, etc. And it doesn't work in every Mental Challenge.<br/>\n  So, if he were engaged in a Physical Challenge, he doesn't have many tools to use. Same for Social Challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For the Nemesis, the point was that you could make your dream character with your hero, then make a character that creates the issues you want to face when playing the game. Does that make sense?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156278/#Comment_156278" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T23:41:21+00:00" title="July 12, 2008 11:41PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Dave,<br/><br/>Yep, makes sense.

But would not work to solve riddles, influence people, etc. Sounds about right to me, how about you?<br/>\n<br/>\n  As to your datastream power, I would probably say, its has a Mental Arena Tag. Mental Challenges cover riddles, sneaking, noticing, collecting and understanding clues, hacking, electronics, security, etc. Sounds like what your power was made for, no? But it probably wouldn't help in a fight or to jump, climb or persuade people. I don't know if its a power or a super power. I guess it depends on how/when you see it not working in a mental challenge. Since it could be used to overcome some physical challenges in the form of bypassing them to show up somewhere else, I might make the power like this:<br/>\n"I am the Grid" (Power, Mental, Physical) This power can be used in both Physical and Mental Challenges, but not all of them.

For instance you say "one side picks the Arena, the other side picks the Scope" that's super easy to write it that way, but much harder to get people to play it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat usually (IME) winds up happening is people do the usual roleplaying talky talk, and eventually someone realizes they should be rolling dice for something and then everybody scratches their head trying to figure out how to shoehorn 5 minutes of talky talk into a formal conflict arena, especially when the whole gamut of DitV escalations happened in that 5 minutes (i.e. well when we started we were guests at the governors party trying to make the other guy look bad, and then we started exchanging words, trying to get the villain to give up his evil ways, and that's when she slapped me, so now I'm throwing down with my powerz...what arena is that?...) usually this winds up with a very uncomfortable degree of ret conning and rewinding.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative is to make the game force you to not do the talky talk thing and always to act within the framework of the current conflict with very hard line distinctions made between conflict scenes and non conflict scenes and easy to remember triggers for when one becomes the other.  This IME steers the game away from that "just playing my character" thing that is the default mode for many players.  So you'll want to pay very particular attention as to whether the feel of play when enforcing hard coded conflict arenas is the feel you're looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go with this, my advice is to go with absolutely clear procedures.  Not definitions.  Definitions are helpful but they won't make it happen.  Default play procedures (i.e. "I'm just playing my character") won't get you there, no matter how clear your definitions are.  You'll need very clear and concise triggers for unmistakably identifying when a conflict starts and a simple and direct sequence of "and then you do X" type of rules to make sure all the toggles are properly set.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an alternative:<br/>\nIf the primary purpose of Conflict Arena are to determine when powers (etc.) apply, then you probably don't want to go full on hard coded to get there as doing so has alot of other ramifications that really aren't necessary to deal with.  Instead, let players buy the arena they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nA brainstormed example that might or might not fit with your current rules:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) define a conflict in very simple terms such as "anything you are trying to do that impacts anything written on another characters character sheet (including preventing such from being used)" is a "conflict"<br/>\n2) Whenever a player narrates doing such a thing to another character a conflict begins and they select the arena both characters will be operating under (ideally to their advantage).<br/>\n3) the other player can spend a benie to use an ability normally reserved for a different arena (or to change the arena entirely for both parties, or whatever seems to work).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat way you avoid some of the "rubberbanding" of Hero Quest and Dogs Traits by making players pay for their trait stretching, but you don't need to shoehorn everything into a box.<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw" title="tobiasopdenbrouw"><img alt="tobiasopdenbrouw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw">tobiasopdenbrouw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156433/#Comment_156433" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T10:26:19+00:00" title="July 14, 2008 10:26AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br><br>That's actually quite a good explanation, thanks.<br><br>Now to break your chargen.<br><br>"Here is my character book.

Weaknesses play into the GMs hands.

One, the player and the GM can work it out at chargen. Two, during the Challenge, each trait in play has to be narrated in, so in order to use all your cool powers, the GM is given turns to narrate in your cool weaknesses.<br>\n  They are worth the same amount of Effect Points, so its a zero sum game and an exercise in futility yo just keep listing off Trait after Trait. So again, we have a point where the players can talk about how the game is playing and work it out on their own.<br>\n  I take your meaning though and when we do play testing, maybe I'll see if one of the players wants/is willing to play an excessive character.<br>\n  Thanks for posting, I appreciate it.<br>\nDave M                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156487/#Comment_156487" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T13:39:37+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  1:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br>\n  The two things that I think helps with this regard is, you can't change the world without using the Challenge system.

For instance, if one person is at risk, you each roll a d4, if a nation is at risk you roll a d20)<br>\n - Players take turns narrating bringing various Traits into play (powers, weaknesses, etc) or use Grit to mod existing Traits<br>\n - When this is done, both players roll their Scope die and add their traits to that roll<br>\n - The Total is called Effect Points, the player with the highest total is the Winner.<br>\n - The Winner can Spend Effect Points to lower the Loser's total.<br>\n - If the Loser has any EPs left, they can spend them to lower the Winner's total<br>\n - The Winner can buy whatever game world effects they want (this basically means buying Traits for characters in the setting) including Traits, Tags, number of characters affected and duration.To clarify, it is theoretically possible for the players to Permanently give everyone in the world a Super Power (or Super weakness for that matter). It would just take a large coordinated effort that massively overcame the opposition.<br>\n - The Loser can buy Traits that do not contravene the Trais the Winner bought if they have any EPs left<br>\n - The GM narrates all of this happening<br>\n<br>\n  So, what I mean is, the characters literally can't change the world without using this system (There isn't even an XP system). And that someone HAS to be opposing them in order for them to effect that change.<br>\n  The point of this mechanic is twofold: One, I want the players to actually be able to change the world in a way they find interesting.

Its this "whenever a character I control trys to do something to a character you control, its a conflict (i.e. Complication in Uni jargon)".<br/>\n<br/>\n2) the rules for all the stuff that isn't a Complication is equally clear and unequivacable.  Its this "I can say and do anything I want with any of the things under my authority (subject to being challenged) by paying the appropriate Game Resources to make it happen".<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The results are completely Fortune in the Middle, which means first we narrate all the ways and reasons to have Traits in the complicationk, then we determine who wins, then we figure out the whys and the wherefors.  FitM works best when the only constraints on the whys and the wherefors are the traits (and such) that went into the conflict to begin with.   Having a hard coded Arena puts an arbitrary limit on the output that I'm not sure adds any benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what the game does is clearly delineate my sandbox from your sandbox and let me do most anything I want in my sandbox, but then we roll dice when we want to play in the other guys sandbox.  In Uni the sandboxes are also completely malleable which probably isn't pertinent to your game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the telling question for me is this:<br/>\nyou say\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">One player picks the Arena (physical, mental, social)</div>\n</blockquote>\nbut what I want to know is...why?  what tells a player "its now time to pick an Arena, conflict has begun".<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the entire game played 100% of the time in Arena mode.  As soon as this is resolved we frame up another conflict in a different Arena?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not then you'll have a bunch of time wheres people are saying stuff that sounds like it should change the world that you aren't using this system for.  If I say "Hard Rock is pissed, he smashes his way into the news room demanding that the paper print a retraction of their recent smear piece" do we have to have a conflict where we go through that proceedure, just to let my Thing hack bust up the joint?  If not then here's a time where the world is being changed outside of the mechanic.  Do we then have a conflict about whether the newspeople agree to the retraction?  If so is it social (because I'm trying to change their minds) or Physical (because I'm smashing the joint up)?  If its social...then you have a situation where I'll never be able to intimidate anyone into doing anything unless I specifically define an "intimidate" power.  If its physical...then you have a situation where I can win any social conflict just by smashing stuff up...as an example of how those seemingly simple arenas get blurry right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess the next obvious question is:  what are you trying to accomplish with the Arenas.  They seem more of an obstacle than a boon, but I might be missing the purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSay Yes or Roll the Dice can work, but I'm not sure it will for this application.  It works effectively in Dogs because Dogs is a fairly loose conflict system.  You can rubberband the Traits, you can escalate, you can do all kinds of things.  You'd be hard put to find a conflict in which you COULDN'T eventually justify every die on your sheet (save relationships, which someone oddly are nailed down pretty tightly).  But that works well for Dogs...because the point is exactly to tempt you into using all those dice...its less "do you when" and more "what did you have to do to win" (which btw, isn't a bad theme for a supers game either).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure whether SYoRtD will work for you because there are tactical elements leading up to a Conflict (which you indicate are desireable) that may or may not play nice with it.  Without having played...it occurs to me that the GM would have pretty tremendous power to help or hose you based on when they decide to say yes and when they decide to roll.  Saying yes to things that otherwise would be difficult and going to dice for things that are a characters strengths will produce a vastly different feel than going to dice over things the character isn't good at and saying yes to the things they could actually roll well in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlot of that is just musings, more along the lines of "something to watch out for in your playtests" then "something that you need to fix ASAP"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156537/#Comment_156537" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T17:42:47+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  5:42PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i don't have a whole lot to say, but i'm finding all of this extremely interesting.<br>i do have a couple things i'd like to jump in on though:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>- The Winner can Spend Effect Points to lower the Loser's total.<br>- If the Loser has any EPs left, they can spend them to lower the Winner's total</br></blockquote>What's the point of this?

Your Thing dude is probably focused on Physical stuff, but yeah, you want him to be able to intimidate and scare people into doing stuff.  If that's normally Social, as I understand it, you could use one of those points to allow him to use a Physical Arena "Smash Stuff Up and Kick the Snot Out of People" Power for a Social conflict.<br>Of course, I can see how this may still be problematic, because it may mean that sometimes, for no good reason, he just won't be able to intimidate people because you don't have any points.  hmmmm...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156544/#Comment_156544" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T17:49:11+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  5:49PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br>\n  I do not know Uni.

Assuming the Hard Rock has a Power or Super power that would enable him to smash a place up (ala Super Strength or whatever), then there is no need to roll to see if he can do it. Once this sequence starts, one player would determine the Arena. The Arena could either be physical, for all the thrashing going on and the effort to stop him, or social to represent the intimidation. This is why it comes to one player to decide, we need a final arbiter for those gray areas. The Scope would probably be the Station. That is what is threatened. This is a 1d6 Scope. It could be smaller if its a small station or bigger if the other player wants to see the situation as threatening the viewers as well.<br>\n  Hm, I guess that is the criteria for Challenge, there has to be three components: Target, Threat and Protector. In this case, the Studio, Hard Rock and whoever is going to stop him (a hero/villain/tv producer/swat team?). Does that put it in better clarity?<br>\n  And based on that, can you make a cool, broken character?<br>\nDave M                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156547/#Comment_156547" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T18:03:31+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  6:03PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian,<br>\n  Thanks!<br>\n<br>\n  The point of it is to game the system. The effects in the game have a pre-set cost in EPs. So, maybe you want to prevent the other player from being able to affect a whole city, but want to maintain as many points as possible for your own effects? Or maybe you want to hit the other guy as hard as possible in his EP total, but want to save enough points to still effect the whole city. Of course, then you will leave yourself vulnerable to the other player, but its all a gamble, right?<br>\n  Does that sound interesting?
