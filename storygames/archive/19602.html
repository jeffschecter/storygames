I am a man, and I have noticed the social dynamics are unavoidably different when a group is all male. I should make sure it's clear - I am speaking of the actual people participating, not of the characters. I believe this effect is a handicap to good play, roughly equal to how difficult it would be to write good drama with the constraint that all your characters are male. I assume there would be similar problems for an all female group, but I'm really not qualified to say. So, now I'm wondering - am I not the first to come to this realization, and if not what has already been said on this?<br/><br/>I realize 'really great session' is subjective and largely a function of my own preferences.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435573/#Comment_435573" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T15:24:01+00:00" title="July 21, 2014  3:24PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think is says more about the values and norms in your social group.

For clear examples of the opposite ends of the continuum, it is my experience that <i>My Life with Master</i> and other similar drama games are basically always better with a mixed crew, while hardcore D&amp;D tends to be better with an all-male group - although I should clarify that that's not due to the maleness per se, but rather merely because all the good/committed/interested D&amp;D players around here seem to be men, and more often than not the social reasons for a mixed D&amp;D crew are of a nature that distracts from the game. Even disregarding the demographic bias and assuming equivalent skill, though, I wouldn't assume that D&amp;D would benefit particularly from a mixed group; it's simply not a very gendered game. (To be clear, that observation goes for the highly specific type of D&amp;D that we play around here; it could be different for others.)<br/><br/>Also, the specific gender quality and relationships of the people involved matter; I've historically gotten basically similar outcomes from gender-mixed groups and highly empathetic male groups with a good personal chemistry, for example. I would not be inclined to characterize the social and creative effects of mixing genders as entirely unique, but rather merely the simplest and most robust way of enriching certain facets of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435580/#Comment_435580" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T16:25:09+00:00" title="July 21, 2014  4:25PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2014 4:40PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with the OP.

I've DM'd all female groups, mixed groups, and (obviously) all male groups. While there were certainly differences I think they were due to individual issues, not gender ones. It happens that my best games, BY FAR, have been in all male groups...however it wasn't because they were all male, but because all of other factors (story, players, focus, charcters, dedication, luck, etc).<br/><br/>I would agree that it does depend somewhat on the game (some do lend themselves to mixed company), and even more than that, the social dynamic/environment. <br/><br/>For instance, my guy friends and I often play board games. It's usually a barrel of fun. In a relationship we often have game night with other couples. It's also a barrel of fun. The games are equally fun, though different. However, ask me which I enjoyed more and it will ALWAYS be the couples nights. Why? Because I'm with someone who isn't just my friend, but my significant other. That makes everything we do together better than anything we do apart.<br/><br/>When I pull back from my own biased feelings, however, and analyze the raw quality of play I'm forced to acknowledge that it hinges neither on relationship status nor gender, but a host of other factors such as I mentioned before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435593/#Comment_435593" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T22:45:12+00:00" title="July 21, 2014 10:45PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Count me in for "somewhere between preferable and vital". <br/><br/>It's certainly possible to have a great gaming group that's non-gender-diverse, but there's something about a mixed-gender environment that I find socially and creatively inviting. <br/><br/>It makes for good drama, too, somehow - I like mixed-gender casts best in movies and TV shows, as well.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, it's just about the people playing, and their unique personalities, and how you feel about them.<br/><br/>Playing with people I really like and respect, that's where it's at.

I'm the most "cis" one in it (I'm male, het, kinky, poly). Sometimes our diversity matters, sometimes it doesn't. They're all awesome people and I just like hanging out with them.<br/><br/>I've also done a fair amount of sausagefest gaming. Fairly recently, I played the (female) witch in a game of <i>Witch: the Road to Lindesfarne</i> with an all-guy cast. I had to point out when we were done that we were a group of dudes playing a game about violence against women, so that we could reflect on it. In some ways, the game was better for not having women there, because it let us be dumbass guys and then reflect on social justice issues afterwards as guys. I've also facilitated (not played) the game three times since then, twice with mixed-gender groups, and once facilitated (not played) with a mostly-women group where the only dude played the witch (at the demands of the female players, actually). Again, gender mattered a lot here.<br/><br/>In general, the all-male groups I've played with shy away from any kind of romantic or sexual role-play. The most you'll see is some stupid, macho behavior that I tend to shut down as a GM. I like having a mixed group to make people behave like human beings, rather than as "men."

But, come on, "society is uncomfortable with two or more genders in it."? How come you get that from my words up there?<br/><br/>Anyway. First, stop assuming I'm speaking from the perspective of a person who isn't comfortable speaking with people of a different -allow me to take this further- gender/sexual orientation. In fact, take sex completely out of the issue for a moment, though it looks like the focus of the discussion. I dare you all to think gender neutral.<br/><br/>If you have known your friends for a long time and/or in deep, there are probably too little stuff you're not open about, maybe not everyday, but at least you talk about all kind of intimate stuff when it really matters. You can joke with these people in ways you wouldn't joke with a stranger because you know what kind of things they will forgive you and what not. These people are in your comfort zone.<br/><br/>Then there are the people you know through your friends and that, since you don't know them too well, you can't be sure about their sensitivity over certain issues that can be the meat of the jokes between you and your closer friends. When these people, you, and your friends are together, that's a mixed group. The tone of the jokes and subjects being talk about in a mixed group is adjusted to the level of intimacy you have with the person you know the least, at least until that person shows signs of integration that lets the group relax, or until someone forces the integration through some daring act of humor that happens to work.<br/><br/>Until that happens, most people of the group will be acting A BIT out of their comfort zone (in spanish, the term A BIT is really crucial, it means that something isn't definitive, nor applies to every case, may be subjective, not the truth in every case, etc. perhaps now you get what I meant)<br/><br/>Ok, now add all the gender issues you want, that will make the comfort zone bigger for some people and smaller for some others. But as you can see, it doesn't really make a difference, except in people's minds.<br/><br/>Then again, let me talk again of the thing that I really find interesting about this discussion: any game can act not only as a "social lubricant" but as a temporary refuge for people who are feeling out of their comfort zone. These people tend to focuse more in the game and people focused on any game actually make the experience of playing it better, hence anyone playing a game in a mixed group (think of the gender-neutral definition I'm trying above) usually has a better game experience. Oh, note that I'm saying "Game Experience", not "a fun afternoon with your friends" both things may intersect and feel like the same but are completely different. You can all roll laughing on the floor while trying to play D&amp;D in a totaly gonzo session, that's "a fun afternoon with your friends" but not the fun as intended by the game designers.<br/><br/>EDIT: Another possibility comes to my mind, that everyone in the group is taking the spirit of the game seriously. It's a rarer experience for me, I admit, but completely possible and may happen more often for some groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435638/#Comment_435638" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T15:06:12+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  3:06PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had tons of fun mixed-gender RPG sessions and tons of fun all-male RPG sessions.<br/><br/>There are plenty of differences between the two in my experience, but that's just my experience, and with different men or different women I'm sure it'd be different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435639/#Comment_435639" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T15:08:01+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  3:08PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2014 4:19AM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're absolutely right, WM.  Yet strictly speaking that is a separate issue, orthogonal to the question of gender.  IOW the existence of the dynamic you describe does not obviate the gender dynamics alluded to by the OP.<br/><br/>Male energy and female energy are different, and it's a mistake of political correctness to assume they're not.  You may certainly take issue with the shorthand words I've just used to describe them - if you prefer saying "yin and yang" or "vertical and horizontal" or whatever words you want, I'm fine with that - but whatever words we use, there is a difference between two basic archetypal patterns of energy in the world, which in many cultures are frequently referred to as "male and female".  These energies are not exclusive, everyone has a mix, etc.  And STILL this spectrum, with two poles and a 0 in the middle, exists.  This duality is a normal feature of the human perception of reality. [added for Albey: <i>western.</i>]<br/><br/>Now.  Because artistically speaking I set as a goal for myself the simulation of a deeply "realistic" world in all possible ways, and because my experience of the <i>real</i> world is about the exchange of these two types of energy to form what we call "communities", and because - maybe more than most people? - I feel drawn toward <i>communal</i> energy more than I feel drawn to either pole of the sexual spectrum, it stands to reason that my theoretically optimal group would include as much variety and diversity of energies and opinions as I see in the world around me.<br/><br/>My weekly group is 8 people.  We have gender variety, we have sexual variety, we have racial variety.  It's really cool and it hits all the notes.  Keepin' it real, homies.  Strive for that.  Be the change.

The super badass woman?). So that's how I played her. Something about this brashness or forwardness went against what this GM thought of as "femininity" I guess. I just kinda tilted my head and thought, "this says more about <i>you</i> than about <i>my character</i>."

So, in my experience, everyone is different. Specifically pointing out the differences in sex of the participants is rather pointless.<br/><br/>AsIf, I would like to point out that not all cultures believe in only two genders, or even a single spectrum of genders. What you say is a normal feature of human perception of reality, is actually just a common feature of English-speaking culture. And some other cultures. Thinking about it, language probably has a lot to do with it.<br/><br/>What you really want is simply a wide enough variety of people in your group to keep things interesting.

I have three main ones and two of them have men and women in them. While one had a femal player for a while but she is no longer playing with us and so it is an all guy group now. But there are different kinds of diversity to that and the other groups. We have different walks of life and different experiences because of that. We have a farmer, a mechanic, a studied historian and journalist. A married father playing with seemingly eternal bachelors. Ages ranging from 16 to 40 (That is actually a father bringing his son as a guest player over the school holidays). The most gender diverse group with a 50/50 split is actually the one with the most homogenous backgrounds of life. All within a 5 year range of age, all students or former students with mostly an overlap of majors.<br/>I value the diversity of experiences and how those add to the games. But I do not choose my groups by it.
