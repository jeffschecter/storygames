I had the opportunity to play a unique game of "The Quiet Year" at the local Story Games meetup last week that I thought was worth sharing. <br/><br/>4 of us wanted to tell the tale of a community of civilian/survivors during a wartime conflict in Eastern Europe. We wanted to look at the game "<a href="http://www.11bitstudios.com/games/16/this-war-of-mine" rel="nofollow">This War of Mine"</a> through the lens of <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year/" rel="nofollow">"The Quiet Year" </a><br/><br/>This was my actual first time playing The Quiet Year, but I had read the book previously. Knowing what I know now, I would have done a few things differently. I was surprised on how little hacking or modding of the original game needed to facilitate this concept.<br/><br/>I wrote up the full game <a href="http://www.ericvulgaris.com/blog/the-quiet-war-of-mine" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>The Quiet Year was a great game for exploring this idea and I would definitely do something like this again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448994/#Comment_448994" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-12T14:00:21+00:00" title="October 12, 2015  2:00PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for this.  I've played "This War of Mine" and had been thinking it would be a great setting for an RPG, I just didn't know which to try.  I'll take a look at "The Quiet Year" now. I don't think I've finished a game of TWoM--too depressing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448999/#Comment_448999" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-12T19:02:10+00:00" title="October 12, 2015  7:02PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome idea for a TQY setup!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris" title="ericvulgaris"><img alt="ericvulgaris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nJV8DKZOO3TSE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris">ericvulgaris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449000/#Comment_449000" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-12T19:02:18+00:00" title="October 12, 2015  7:02PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2015 7:04PM by ericvulgaris.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mel! You're welcome! Thank you reading it.<br/><br/>Yeah The Quiet Year is simply one of the best, easiest games to get going. Do keep in mind that the game's playtime can be long (Easily 4 Hours for a first time game.) I think our tone of the game at the table was probably lighter than the fiction gave to. I think the banter/comments helped diffuse some of the serious tension and no one objected to this.<br/><br/>I am contemplating doing a game of Microscope and/or Kingdom to tell the story of a community surviving through war in a similar fashion to This War of Mine as well. I'd personally love to play both of them and then compare/contrast the three games in how they handle the concept and themes of community's surrounded by conflict.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449035/#Comment_449035" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-14T21:14:23+00:00" title="October 14, 2015  9:14PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cross-posting from Story Games Seattle)<br/><br/>This was probably my favorite Quiet Year game that I've played. The real-world grimness was a perfect fit and it really grounded things.<br/><br/>In hindsight, religion *totally* should have been on our scarcity/abundance list. It was the crux of a lot of what was going on.<br/><br/>Thanks a ton Eric for suggesting this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X" title="Charlie_X"><img alt="Charlie_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/513/nSBLNVCY6RNQO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X">Charlie_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449045/#Comment_449045" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-15T16:48:43+00:00" title="October 15, 2015  4:48PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A great way of running The Quiet Year.
