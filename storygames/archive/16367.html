I need some advice for a game of monophobia I am running for my wife. It's an out of the book adventure called "Vengeance from Beyond," where the player is haunted by a ghost, and has to decipher an ancient tome to learn a ritual, so she can fight the ghost directly. The problem is, we've made it to the part of the game where she has to decipher the text, and by the book, the next session is going to be 5 days of reading, while getting haunted by this ghost. Therein she'll learn the ritual, need to kill herself, fight teh ghost, then get someone to resurrect her, in a romeo and juliet esque pseudodeath.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haunted the living CRAP out of her for the 72 hours she spent under supervision at the psych ward, and all of this ghost's "by the book" hauntings are old hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a companion with her, a friend/suspended cop whose been similarly haunted for 3 days, and has lost a ton of sanity. He's obsessed with completing the banishment ritual, and has started carving endersigns into his hand. He also killed a doorman, but she doesn't know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to shake it up, let the next few days of "research" happen with some excitement, and get her some permanent psychoses. Ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373877/#Comment_373877" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T16:17:57+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  4:17PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2012 4:21PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, pretty challenging. Would be easier to start with an empty chalkboard, so as to build up the ghost's style. Let's see what we've got:<br/><br/>The ghost tries to give her a suspicious parcel she'll presumably refuse. The ghost starts leaving the parcel for her in obvious places. Then it starts appearing alongside anything she receives from other people - fast food plates, courier shipping, so on. The car keys she receives from her lover are given two-handed, the parcel out-tretched in the other hand. The parcel continuously drops from her home's mail hatch. Throwing the parcel away will obviously just cause it to come back, while putting it safely away will cause the same - only keeping it in sight keeps it down. Within the parcel is the tome she's been reading.<br/><br/>The cop friend's skin starts peeling slowly. Later on it's easy to see tufts of different-coloured hair poking out of his skalp, for example. It's the same colour as the ghost's. She has a dream where her own fingernails start to drop out.<br/><br/>She's just spent a day reading the book with nothing untoward happening. She's made good progress. That night, the GM rolls 50/50 for whether she wakes up to realize that it was just a dream. (This bit only works if you do explicit ironic game mechanics, of course.)<br/><br/>The ghost convinces her that it's the ghost of her own child, or her own ghost from the future, or something along those lines. It tells her things only she knows. It asks for her help in avoiding a great disaster. It totally guilt-trips her for refusing to listen even after some impressive proof.<br/><br/>In the morning hours after a failed night of haunting a bit of poltergeist activity starts to happen. The ghost is evidently frustrated due to its failures. After throwing things around for a bit it apparently calms down, focusing on a single needle taken from her sewing supplies. The needle floats two inches in front of her left eye for the rest of the day, wherever she goes.<br/><br/>As a last resort, she or perhaps the cop friend fumbles with the book and drops it. Afterwards the letters are all mirrored, forcing her to read with a mirror. Nothing suspicious appears in the mirror, not even in low-light conditions or candlelight, or when she's reading with her back to the window or doorway. Be sure to reassure her of this regularly.<br/><br/>Ah, that was fun. Perhaps I'll do more later. Do you have any hints about the ghost's style or theme?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373878/#Comment_373878" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T16:18:35+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  4:18PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For one, I'd say steer far away from the plotline laid out in the adventure. Maybe have her wake up to a sunny day, where everything is cheery and warm and not-at-all crazy, with everything that had happened seeming like a terrible dream. Her cop friend is back on the force, working hard to keep the city safe.<br/><br/>Once she's gotten used to the "everything's safe" bit (yeah, the player would be suspicious, but if she's playing in-character, it may work), start to introduce stuff that's strange, bit by bit.<br/><br/>The neighbor's dog gets loose, and is found half-burrowed into the character's back yard, gnawing at its leg for no reason.<br/><br/>Every time she succeeds in a skill check, have a crow fall dead from the clear blue sky.<br/><br/>The pipes in her house start to rattle, with occassional discharges of severly rusty water.<br/><br/>One of the light switches won't turn on when she tries to turn it on, but does when someone else does.<br/><br/>She has an increasingly hard time reading books or the newspaper, as if dyslexic.<br/><br/>Just start building these things up, cranking up the shadowy creep factor, until she's doing everything she can to break free from the nightmare she's been stuck in for the last five hours of actual character time. Break out the sanity checks and mythos lore to get free.<br/><br/>Or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373879/#Comment_373879" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T16:23:22+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  4:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would make a totally bitching ghost, I'm now convinced.

What I need to do is make the haunting, story-wise more creepy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should also break down the ritual to parts that will get her out of the house. Make the ritual unsavory. <br/>\nPart 1 : obtain a baby lamb, feed it rice soaked in blood for 3 days. Something like that. but while she's doing, this I also want to keep the story moving forward. Introduce characters from her life... family. Show how these relationships are all breaking down. Maybe the family wants to get her back into "treatment."<br/>\n<br/>\nI can play out one scene with the family relationship break down while she's trying to get enough pig's blood for the ritual.<br/>\nThis can be followed by a scene where her home life is falling apart. Maybe she has to burn a book for warmth. Her police friend, currently handcuffed to a couch, could confess that he loves her. That if he lives through it, he wants to marry her. A bunch of stuff he's not going to remember or feel in 2 days' time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373937/#Comment_373937" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T09:00:00+00:00" title="April 21, 2012  9:00AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could the ghost possess someone ? possibly someone who is dead.<br/>\nHave a news report of a death on tv with pictures of the victim (obviously before the death) e.g. a car accident mugging where a week minded down and out has been possessed by the ghost and tempted into murder?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave the murdered person turn up on the doorstep trying to gain access to the book.
