For instance, we never claim to the be the pure cheapest, nor do we claim to have the highest end production values. Often our box packaging is cheaper than other board games, our die cut game counters are a little thinner, etc, but where some games give you 400 die cut counters in a $40 package, we have a game the offers 1,700+ in a $35 package. So our USP has always been to pack the most "game" into the package that we can for the price. Not to simply offer the cheapest game, not to offer the prettiest game or the most flashy or the game with the best long term collectors value, but rather the game with the most scope, playability and player options within the confines of the production format and costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, most USP are only relative when compared to the like competition you have on the market. The less "like competition" you have, generally the better off you seem because you are offering some more generally unique to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Wiki's got a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition" rel="nofollow">article</a>on it:\n<blockquote>The Unique Selling Proposition (also Unique Selling Point) is the marketing concept that was first proposed as a theory to explain a pattern among successful advertising campaigns of the early 1940s. It states that such campaigns made unique propositions to the customer and that this convinced them to switch brands.<br/><br/>Today, a number of businesses and corporations currently use USPs as a basis for their marketing campaigns.<br/><br/>In his book Reality in Advertising, Rosser Reeves (Chairman of the Board at Ted Bates &amp; Company) gives the precise definition as it was understood at his company:<br/><br/>   1. Each advertisement must make a proposition to the customer: "buy this product, and you will get this specific benefit."<br/>   2. The proposition itself must be unique - something that competitors do not, or will not, offer.<br/>   3. The proposition must be strong enough to pull new customers to the product.<br/><br/>However, Reeves warns against forming a USP based on what he calls "The Deceptive Differential" - a uniqueness that is too small or too technical for customers to observe the differences in actual practice.</blockquote>\nOf note is the focus on a <i>specific benefit </i>that the consumer receives, rather than focusing on features of the product. In Ben's example above, the specific benefit for buying <i>Polaris </i>is it tells you how to play <i>Polaris</i>. An interesting marketing pitch based on brand image, not really on a USP (IMHO).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108199/#Comment_108199" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T01:14:25+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  1:14AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, your answer seems intentionally crass.

I think a lot of people have never been asked this question, and are caught blind by it.I know I was.It doesn't mean that you don't have an answer, just that not everyone has thought of their game in that way and is prepared to give that answer.\n<blockquote>I'm very interested in what you think your product's Unique Selling Point is.</blockquote>\nI usually start out by telling people my games name.

While I've come around in many respects, I still ask "Uh, what will this do that some other game I have doesn't already handle reasonably well?"  So, I'm getting hung up on the "unique" part of that question.  As such, I'm going to see if maybe I can talk my way into understanding this.<br/><br/>Given that, honestly, even if Ben comes across as a bit crass, his point is damned valid.  I can't do Polaris with any other game.  Maybe that's a piss-poor marketing approach, but what sells me on the game is that is Polaris, not some gimmick that is a part of the game.  (Of course, what sold me on the game was Paul Tevis telling me to buy it, but that's a different point entirely.)  Similarly, I haven't seen a two-player-versus-hardcore-gamist-but-with-narrative game like Beast Hunters.  On the other hand, Christian's fiction point it fails to feel like a USP to me.  Same with Levi's "You play a dragon" line.  You game could be the greatest dragon game in the world (and perhaps *that's* a USP), but the fact that you play a dragon is maybe novel, but not unique.<br/><br/>To talk up my ashcan brother Jeff Lower and his game Giants, I don't think "you play Giants" is the USP, but the mechanically-tied-in cooperative map creation/alteration is one.  Maybe.  ( And this isn't to knock Jeff at all.)<br/><br/>If "Unique Selling Point" is just another way of saying "what's your hook?" then sure, these all work.  But then why ask for a <em>Unique</em> Selling Point when you could just ask for someone's hook or elevator pitch or something like that?<br/><br/>Last, I respect if "I do game X better than game X" as a USP if it's truly unique and is a selling point, if not a highly pretentious and presumptive one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108338/#Comment_108338" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T20:10:37+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  8:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>If "Unique Selling Point" is just another way of saying "what's your hook?" then sure, these all work.

I like to think that customers -- especially our customers -- are better informed than that.  I know that I didn't buy <em>PTA</em> because it was the game about television, but because it had Fan Mail.

I'm not devaluing the concept of the selling point/hook/blurb/whatever -- I know I had that for my ashcan.  But if the word "unique" is going to be stated, then it should be used.  Example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Small rules, big changes in your d20 game.</blockquote>\nis what many "my d20-based game but with tweaks to make it more align with my vision" claim, or some variation thereof.  A good goal, selling point, and hopefully a good product?  Totally.  Unique?  No.  Maybe the ways in which Ryan achieves this is, but he hasn't stated that in this thread about USPs.<br/><br/>Like I said in my initial comment: I'm going to get hung up on that word.  I mean, shit, I wrote an ashcan for a one-PC/many-GM one-night game about an amnesiac fighting against its subconscious in order to reverse his unknown fate, using a system that <a href="http://www.tomorrowtheworldgames.com/knowthyself/ashcan/cards/" rel="nofollow">uses a highly custom card deck with nearly a half-dozen more elements on a set of poker cards</a> in order to instantly generate location, characters, and (ideally) situation.  *deep breath*  And I have a problem finding the uniqueness in that.  <em>Maybe</em> the way the card deck is composed.  But I digress.  (And to be fair, I have been beating myself up over the way the game's turning out, so I'm fairly negative about it.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>I mean, I could say that "Hoard's <b>big awesome thing</b> is how it uses improv-like dynamics over here, and dice tactics over there, all strapped together with this tokens-flying-around stuff, and does that<i>in a way</i>that is unique and thing-unto-itself."</blockquote>\nIt's honest, and frankly, has me interested in checking out Hoard.

"gritty historical game" could apply to many games, for example.</blockquote>\nA common criticism of the USP approach is that its hard to decide when a benefit is unique or not. If Kleenex is soft, that's a benefit, but its certainly not unique. If it is the softest of facial tissues, that's also a benefit but is the fact that it is better at something the same as being unique? Arguably it is, but there's a problem if the consumer can't differentiate between Kleenex and the next softest brand. The benefit is the same.<br/><br/>USPs are just one approach to sales and they're very useful in cases where you can clearly describe the unique benefit to the consumer in such a way that it affects purchasing decisions. It is strong because it focuses on selling benefits rather than features and because it avoids becoming a "me too" product. A market full of numerous soft facial tissue offerings becomes comoditized rather quickly unless you can find other benefits to differentiate the brands (economy, hypo-allergenic, pretty, scented, etc.). Basically, the theory is that when you can identify a Unique Selling Point it should be front and center in your marketing. You may be able to show that each benefit is not unique in its own right, but together they form a unique combination. Unique at a certain price is also a valid value proposition.<br/><br/>There are other ways to sell products. Branding and image marketing works by associating the brand with something the consumer can identify with. Josh's example of DitV as a game of "Mormon Paladins" is not a very good example of a USP, because its not a benefit to anyone until the game shows you that you were searching for a way to play Mormon Paladins all along. It is a great example of branding because it screams "this game is different from anything else!"  It is also a great teaser campaign because it sets up an intriguing cognitive dissonance that prompts the next question "What's a Morman Paladin and how do you play one?" And the attitude implies that there's coolness that the reader isn't part of yet, but wants to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108470/#Comment_108470" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T19:22:42+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  7:22PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A USP (Unique Sales Proposition) is all about branding. A game or line of games revolve around building a brand. Each brand has one or more target consumer demographics that is needs to communicate and connect with. Your USP is what makes your game unique and where that uniqueness matters to the end consumer.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour USP is not based on the theme for your game. Its not based on the genre for your game. Though, yeah, if one or both of those things were highly unique, they "could" be a USP.<br/>\n<br/>\nUSP could be, just for examples:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Flashier production values<br/>\n- Gimmicky large or small format games<br/>\n- Ultra wierd NEO lights attached to your games<br/>\n- Fully packaged (say with a complete ready to play minis game including minis and dice if your competitors sold everything separately)<br/>\n- A game where you sell everything separately where all of your competitors only sell everything fully packaged.<br/>\n- Portability<br/>\n- Extremely high end for collectors purposes<br/>\n- Extremely cheap as a novelty<br/>\n- Best bang for your buck content packaging.<br/>\n- Serve for niche or obscure purpose that the competitors products don't.<br/>\n- For IP creators, present content on some wierd or obscure topic or genre that the copetitors don't.<br/>\n- Work mechanically smoother than a competitors product.<br/>\n- Produced in a particular market or condition that your customers would care about enough to want to support it.<br/>\n- Sold where some portion of the sales/profits went to support some charity, some hobby enterprise, UFO fan clubs, etc; whatever activities your target customer base feels strong enough to support.<br/>\n<br/>\nA product with a USP that's only claim is that it was written/created/endorsed/etc by a particular person or company is only as strong as the existant fan base for that person or company. Further, its uniquely useless to everyone that is not a fan.<br/>\n<br/>\nA USP can be darn near anything. But its nearly useless unless its something your target consumer demographic will care about. The more "complicated" your USP is, the harder it will be to effectively market it. If your USP is not truly unique, then its likely much of your marketing work will simply go to enhancing the strength of your competitor's brands that used that same or similar USP prior to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Guild's own USp for several of its games have changed over the years. Yep, you can do that. If you find a USP for a product that works better than the one now, or perhaps where your target demographics have changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo anyone running a business where they are responsible for brand design decisions and marketing design and implementation, this is a topic worthy of reading a couple books on.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

I often want a game that is "like X" or "can do Y" or "supports/encourages/forces Z"--rather than any specific game. Some concrete examples: i'd really like to see the 'trust mechanic' of The Mountain Witch in action. But i'm not at all interested in The Mountain Witch (plus, it's out of print). So, if someone can give me an RPG that is built around open-ended play and no particular story (maybe no particular setting/genre), and incorporates similar trust mechanics, i'd like to see it. I'm always looking for games that are, to me at least, completely new--that's why i bought Polaris. Not because it was "not Sorcerer", and not even because it was "not any other RPG i've ever heard of", but because it was "a collection of mechanics, several of which i've never seen in any other RPG"--IOW, not only is the sum total unique, but many of the component parts are, too. The whole package being unique isn't enough to sell me--at least *something* in there has to be unique on its own, too. A novel combination of existing widgets won't do it for me. [n.b.: One of the unique bits can be the setting: i've happily bought RPGs that are mechanically unremarkable, for their novel settings.]<br/><br/>As far as i'm concerned, RPGs are only differentiated from commodity goods to the degree that their individual elements are differentiated from existing fare. I routinely look at an RPG and put it back because "i've seen it before"--and i don't mean that specific RPG, i mean it's not sufficiently dissimilar to other RPGs to interest me. And, in many of those cases, the combination of mechanical and setting elements may be quite novel--but if it can be summed up as "what would happen if D&amp;D evolved into a modern world" or "mecha meets dragonslayers" or any such thing, it doesn't matter to me how novel the mash-up, unless it produces something that is novel, above and beyond that. Similarly, if someone comes out with a new "universal" RPG system, it has to do something that BESM2, BESM3, Champions 4th, HERO 5th, Fudge, FATE, CORPS, Tri-Stat dX, Sol, True20, Story Engine, Theatrix, MasterBook, QAGS, Risus, Active Exploits Diceless Roleplaying, Cinematrix, Savage Worlds, and Universalis don't do, or why should i buy it instead of using one of those? (Not to mention the other universal RPGs out there that i don't own, or the option of pressing a non-universal RPG engine into service.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109470/#Comment_109470" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T12:02:10+00:00" title="November 24, 2007 12:02PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>A common criticism of the USP approach is that its hard to decide when a benefit is unique or not. [snip] USPs are just one approach to sales and they're very useful in cases where you can clearly describe the unique benefit to the consumer in such a way that it affects purchasing decisions.</blockquote>\nYeah, i agree that USP isn't the only way to market a game, or the only reason to buy one. But, from my observations, it's an important one. (Apparently, "lots of other people play it" is also a powerful incentive to purchasers, though i've never witnessed it personally.)<br/><br/>Frex, with Four Colors al Fresco, i'm running right into the "what <b>is</b> my USP?" question (though i've phrased it more as "what makes Four Colors al Fresco different?"--i don't think it needs to be "unique", i think it needs to be sufficiently different to be compelling, however). See, when we created it, it was easy: no other supers RPG had tried to come at the mechanics from the direction of narrative flexibility; all the supers games approached things from a Gamist perspective, and tried to power-balance characters, ignoring the obvious and inherent imbalance, not to mention fiat-based power changes, of the actual superhero comics medium. Well, that's not quite true: Panels took an approach that was more about narrative- (i.e. spotlight-time-) based balancing, and focused on emulating the stories told in superhero comics, rather than on modeling the superheroes themselves. Sure, there'd been a few lite supers RPGs already (TWERPS, Stuperpowers!, arguably the original MSH and the SAGA Marvel Superheroes), but all pretty much took the same approach, just with varying levels of detail. <br/><br/>Likewise, period supers were pretty much a new thing at that point--i mean, you could obviously do a period setting with Champions or DC Heroes, or MSH, or most any supers game, but very few were actually designed for it. In fact, really only Underground and Providence predate Four Colors al Fresco, and are set in a significantly-unusual setting. <br/><br/>But, since then, things have changed. I collected a bunch of threads from RPGNet and The Forge where people talked about how to "do supers right" with an RPG, and all of them pretty much described Four Colors al Fresco, in broad strokes. The ones i have saved are all from 2002-2003. Setting-wise, Legends Walk!, Godsend Agenda, and Chosen all step on Four Colors al Fresco's toes a bit [n.b.: i'm not claiming any of their creators was even aware of our game, just that they tread some similar ground. For that matter, in the last 4 years Marvel 1602 came out.<br/><br/>But it's on the mechanical side of things where Four Colors al Fresco is much less distinct than it used to be. Since we finished the design work (in 2003), Marvel Universe, With Great Power\u2026, Truth &amp; Justice, and Capes, have all come out, all in one way or another "doing the same thing as" Four Colors al Fresco. All of them are built from the ground up to focus on emulating the stories of superhero comics, with modeling the characters within them being just one part of that--and in all of them except maybe Marvel Universe (i forget), one of the ways they do this is by sacrificing strict character consistency, just like the comics themselves. <br/><br/>So I can no longer simply say "Four Colors al Fresco is unique because it  focuses on emulating the stories of superhero comics, rather than getting caught up in all sorts of fiddly mechanics trying to strictly quantify superheroes in a way that the source material never does, anyway". Now, it *is* very distinct from those games, but it's much harder to describe *how* it's distinct. The best concise summary i've come up with is that Marvel Universe is Gamist, With Great Power\u2026 and Truth &amp; Justice are Narrativist/Gamist, and Capes is, hmmm, either Narrativist/Gamist or just Narrativist, but Four Colors al Fresco is Simulationist. Which would be a lot more useful sales pitch if (1) it didn't rely on a detailed knowledge of the Big Model, or at least GNS, (2) Simulationism was clearly defined in the Big Model, (3) it didn't play right into the ambiguity of terminology between the Big Model and the Threefold, (4) "simulationism" didn't have connotations of hyper-detailed crunch (which al Fresco doesn't have), and (5) there wasn't the potential for confusion between Narrativist and narrative, since Four Colors al Fresco is much more narrative-oriented than any of those, and much less number-crunchy than any of them. Frankly, given (2), i'm not entirely sure, myself, that it's an accurate distinction, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109502/#Comment_109502" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T16:11:04+00:00" title="November 24, 2007  4:11PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For Console: We filed the serial numbers off so you don't have to!
