Each session started off with a game of Fairy Tale Assassin League (because that's what I wanted to run) followed by DW session. Here are my impressions and observations about the rules and the sessions.<br/><br/>First off the freedom the rules suggest was something I took to heart. I set the game in my favorite D+D world (12th Century Europe in Eastern France/Western Germany) with all the players belonging to the same family (the D'Amberlys) who have been sent out to the big city to seek their fortunes. This meant I picked the last name right up front and gave them a choice of an appropriate male and female name to chose from. The characters were largely pre-done because I know my sessions would be shorter than the full session. The players got some customizing to do but mainly it was establishing the bonds and openly telling one another what they were. This jump started the interaction between the players rather than allow the information to emerge in play.<br/><br/>The planned adventure was a simple investigation of a newly destroyed wizard's tower (actually the levels below the tower since the tower itself was blown up. By way of map all I had planned was what the levels were. The complex had a store house/utility room level where goblins would live, a wizard lab level, an ancient temple level and below that an even more ancient cave with a terrible monster in it. The players were drawn to the tower by a flash of light, a explosion sound followed by a rush of sulphurous smells that grew more intense the deeper one when into the ground. <br/><br/>I took the idea of the game being a conversation to heart and explained that to the players. Anything that would stop or break up the flow of conversation would be avoided. This meant using the GM moves to draw the players on or give them consequences for their actions. Foreshadowing danger (with smells of feces (goblin) and sulphur (leading to ever lower levels) and with tracks), giving choices between bad and less bad options, asking people to make sacrifices and then making those meaningful in the story were most common. In combat I largely dealt damage rather than had the player roll for it so I could keep the damage down. Getting a single hit or a couple of hits made things dangerous but not deadly, meanwhile they could cut large swaths through goblins and other monsters. Each player got a highlight moment in each game as well.<br/><br/>Many of the players did not proactively initiate moves with the notable exception of a parley with goblins (where I got to trot out my very limited knowledge of German and French). You have the love the Goblins looking that the dead goblin at the player's feet and saying "Je faim?" motioning towards the heroes and "Je faim" motioning towards themselves and then making the bring food to the mouth hand sign indicating their willingness to share in eating the goblin. Of course I'd already let them overhear the goblins debating if they could parley in German that indicated more goblins were on the way. Pity that none of the players understood - oops!<br/><br/>In each session the main action focused on a different level. The first party chose to encounter the goblins and fight them. The second party avoided the goblins and went to the lab level where they encountered invisible servants who probably caused the explosion in a big trap room. The third run also avoided the goblins and since I removed the lab from their game were able to go down to the temple and the under cave to face a Chinese dragon.<br/><br/>The last run is what showed me how the first run could lead to interesting fronts. Since the complex was guarded by an ancient Christian symbol that a Cathar vampire like wizard was trying to get into, and since they possibly killed the dragon (though one player ate its heart and had visions that it might not be dead (since the player woke with a really cool oriental dragon tattoo on his arm), forces were unleashed that were not meant to be. I see at least two threats coming from this and the involvement of the church and even crusaders. This was a one shot so nothing will come of this.<br/><br/>I liked the rules and could see how I might tweak the moves around to personalize them to my play style for future games. I could see doing a hack. Not know though - too many other projects on the front burner.<br/><br/>Over all I was impressed. I'll continue to combine whatever game I'm doing (since they only take an hour) and a DW run in future Games on Demand events. Looking forward to Gen Con.<br/><br/>Oh! I was also pleased to hear from the people who had played before that I was running the game right. It fit with their previous experiences of play. Nice to have confirmation of that. This is a game with a very powerful GM because the moves can be so broadly applied, though a shared universe because the player's input is going to be important<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416639/#Comment_416639" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T08:02:35+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  8:02AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good writeup, Chris.

Magical being exist but are not the norm. Different races like elves, dwarfs and even goblins are just different humans so it is not so Tolkien like. There are all the historical bits that were happening in 1123AD so there are Cathars in the hills to the south, crusaders off in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Catholic Church everywhere being ignored by most people who still leave milk out for the fairies. Magic and miracles are real, that's what saints, wizards and witches do. <br/><br/>The D'Amberlys come from the small village of Amberly and are sent to the near by city of Mathersville (1000 population - a huge city for the time). At the city they live in the family's hovel and look for a way to advance in the world. They pursue different interests but it all comes back to the family so though they may disagree there is a base reason to always in the end work together. <br/><br/>If the adventure starts in Mathersville, they are in the market place when the blast effects reach them. The effects come from the east (Amberly is in the east) so the locals require the adventurers to investigate it (guilt by association). The trip to the tower is uneventful. When they see the tower the realize it belonged to Ulrich the Mad (who taught the wizard their basic spells).<br/><br/>The map of the dungeon is verbally the following: <br/><br/>Wrecked tower - stone slab with iron ring in it to open trap door.<br/><br/>Storage rooms and utility rooms - here be goblins.<br/><br/>Ulrich's laboratory<br/><br/>Ancient temple<br/><br/>Ancient cave<br/><br/>All other details I made up as they explored. Some players scouted ahead so I asked what they saw and they defined a large round room with magic light in it. I added corridors off it. Others let me describe it and it was a long corridor going two ways. <br/><br/>I knew the dungeon would have lesser monsters (some kind of goblin or kobold) on the first level who have been there for some time. I would warn of them by smelling their foul stench. They would appear as single sentinels and small patrols at first and then grow in number till the players were forced to leave or flee deeper in the dungeon. Exactly how that would play out would depend totally on what the players did.<br/><br/>There would be some kind of invisible spirit/demon on the second level that the players would have to negotiate with and figure a magic way to deal with. That I made up on the spot.<br/><br/>The Temple would foreshadow what was down in the cave. If I could I had any player whose consequence of action was to be noticed to be noticed by this deep evil. I didn't define the evil. If the party had been mainly magical and non-combat oriented I'd have it be more a spirit. As it was the part that got there was more fighter oriented so I have them fight while the magic users dealt with one being possessed and the other having a magic item (taken from a still living Ulich - in that run) that allowed them to see more of the true nature of the beast. <br/><br/>Like in Shadowrun games where the computer matrix is described differently in each game, magic would manifest itself differently in each run. I like description more than spell tables. I also allow players to be very free and creative in their spell use. One thing though was that magic - big magic - required sacrifice - blood sacrifice. The way it worked in The Golden Voyage of Sinbad 1973. Tom Baker (pre Doctor Who) aged himself to cast spells. I just asked for hit points.<br/><br/>With combats I tried to start of with facing one foe, then a couple of foes and then a group of foes. In the first run I foreshadowed more coming by using drum beating ala the Fellowship of the Ring in Moria. With goblins I thought of them as one to three hit point critters. The invisible creature could only be fought with magic and the dragon when it arrived had around 100 hit points - but would really be defeated by a combination of magic and combat. <br/><br/>The main point is that the blank left open were huge and I made up stuff on the spot to fit what the players were doing. Their actions were thus very meaningful. <br/><br/>This is how I've run games for years so it was an easy thing to do.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
