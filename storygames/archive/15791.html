In the original module, there are a lot of helpless humanoid women and children. Some of the females are combatants, to be sure, but many are not. When I played through this module using the original Red Box rules, I ran it as written and ended up with an incident in which one PC, a stone-hearted dwarf mercenary, threw burning oil on a huddled group of hobgoblin young. As soon as he did this, I had the group of hobgoblin females who had been trying to protect the children rush in and stab the dwarf to death with their knives. I rolled well, and he died. I didn't kill his character intentionally, I was just trying to, as objectively as possible, represent what what probably happen in that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, since I am changing things up in the Caves of Chaos, I'm now wondering whether noncombatants belong in the dungeon at all. On the one hand, it's more realistic for humanoids to have mates and young in their lairs, and it forces the PCs to make a moral decision. OTOH, it puts the PCs in a spot, and could easily leave a bad taste in the players' mouths, depending on which way the decision goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm leaning toward just eliminating all the females that aren't combatants, and all the young.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'm noticing that as written, these humanoid tribes are boringly patriarchal. Maybe I'll make some of the female combatants a little scarier while I'm at it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358409/#Comment_358409" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T21:58:45+00:00" title="February  8, 2012  9:58PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2012 10:18PM by jenskot.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also just ran B2: Keep on the Borderlands with both DW and other systems.

Which I sort of find odd since the Caves of Chaos was created back when all Chaotic creatures were basically evil by default.<br/><br/>Anyway, if it's something you want to sidestep, I'd just remove the naturalism and make the humanoid denizens of the caves evil monstrosities born of dark gods long ago. Even Tolkien couldn't make up his mind on the nature and origins of his orcs, so just choosing what works for you and your game isn't a big deal.<br/><br/>Just as a data point, I used to run The Keep on the Borderlands module a lot.

I run adventure modules, so any and all "humanoids" become either inhuman monsters or just different ethnicities of human. So when I have a goblin tribe in the caves, they do certainly have women and children as well, and they're human women and human children, and the players can deal with them in the cultural context of what they're doing, which might range from trade missions to ethnic cleansing, depending on the players. If they want to kill indian women and children, that's on them.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when players meet orcs, they're inhuman, sexless monsters with no capacity for anything resembling culture. That's just what the creature called "orc" is like in my campaign world. Killing their children is a non-issue because they don't have anything resembling a human child.<br/><br/>Note that the original problem comes in because the Gygaxian bullshit humanoids are supposed to be monsters and people at the same time; on the one hand players are supposed to feel good about killing them, but on the other hand they have toddlers running around and wifey just prepared lunch for the hard-working ravager to come home to. I remove either element, and thus never have a situation where campaign metaphysics encourage attrocities.<br/><br/>It should be noted that my solution might still be too cruel or grim for those who want to run heroic games - it's a sandbox setting where I specifically don't bother to work up justifications for the players, which means that if they want to raid local aborogines, we're pretty much going to understand as players that this is our characters being imperialistic assholes. If they want to be heroic in a romantic sense of the term, I suggest treating the natives such as the goblin tribes well: don't attack them unless they attack you first, give quarter to prisoners, make attempts at peace and accept that them merely living underground is not actually a moral reason for attacking their homes and killing them all. And it's not like the aboroginals can't be cruel and hostile, too - if I want heroic adventurers to have a good reason to attack the goblins or whatever where they live, I most definitely have to give them good reason: the goblins are at war with the civilized population of the area, raiding mercilessly. This is still not enough reason to go full hog ethnic cleansing on them where I come from, but it is a basis for just war and resolution-seeking in full panoply.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the Keep on the Borderlands in any detail myself, but I would basically ask myself one question when reading through it: does this module depict a credible primitive human encampment (perhaps in a cave system), or is this a hell-hole where only monsters would live? If it's the former, I'll substitute the plastic mold -issue humanoids with some primitive human tribes, and if it's the latter, I'll substitute them with what amounts to demons. This will, obviously, reduce ambivalence about the adventure location, as it's either going to be "those guys come in to trade at our town a few times per year" or "that place is a doorway to Hell" insofar as the civilized base camp is concerned.<br/><br/>Finally, we did in fact have this scene in our game last fall: we'd been playing through <i>Dyson's Delve</i> (highly recommended free dungeon available in the 'net, by the way), which includes a goblin tribe living on the first couple floors of the deep dungeon, and the players ended up fighting a quite serious war with the goblins. The relations were cordial at first, as the party negotiated free passage through the goblin territories and some auxiliary support in exchange for 20% of their loot, but later on the players (largely a different set of players, as the campaign has a shifting player base), tired of paying a slice of the loot to the goblins, foolishly attacked them and started a cycle of violence that spiralled out of control - some negotiations were had, but as the party refused to pay wergild and caused some serious losses to the goblins, they basically started to fight for their survival as a tribal unit, thirsting for PC blood. Players being what they are, they responded in kind, and ultimately ended up making a few pretty well-organized expeditions against goblins fighting a desperate room-by-room retreat involving massive barricades, trained attack animals and so on. Ultimately the players did in fact stumble on a room-full of goblins too old or young to fight; the most blood-crazed PCs didn't really care, especially as the goblins grabbed some arms and tried to defend themselves, and the rest of the party couldn't stop them, so it became a massacre. Afterwards the characters of more gentle persuasion were notably subdued about reckless war against natives, while the bloodthirsty ones were keen for further bloodshed.

I mean, it seems to me that the groups that have trouble with handling monster children have these problems because they don't have clear socio-psychological understanding of who and what their characters are, and how one would assume such people to act in such situations, and why. This doesn't necessarily have anything to do with my strongly European-flavoured brand of game, this applies to the standard D&amp;D setting as well: presumably this band of adventurers isn't the first one ever to discover goblin children; what do the adventurers <i>expect</i> that an adventurer would do in this situation?<br/><br/>I don't think it's fair for the GM to pretend that there is no precedent, no rules of war, for a society that's apparently been waging war on non-human humanoids ever since the dawn of the world. Surely the player characters know what is acceptable, civilized treatment for the different varieties of common humanoid - maybe they know that goblins are pest animals and need to be eradicated wherever encountered, while the orc tribes should not be unnecessarily aggravated by needless slaughter, and the church actually thinks that hobgoblins have souls, so they have to be treated like humans. Whatever, the point is that I don't think that this is such a difficult problem as long as the adventuring party has their ordinary experience of their world to fall back on. The problematic situation seems to be the one where the GM treats the situation like it's such an unique occurrence that the players have to be some moral trailblazers.<br/><br/>This won't apply to all campaigns, but for us the set of standards the adventurers rely on is basically the mercenary code of Christian Europe. It's not like it's a written down set of rules, but in practice the player characters and non-player characters of the setting have found no difficulty in figuring out where to draw the line between the various varieties of professional warcraft, just war, criminal enterprise, mad atrocity, evil exploitation and other things that are available in the repertoires of player characters. We have a history full of relations between more and less civilized societies to draw on, I've found it unproblematic to just assume that the fantasy society, and by extension player characters, mostly act according to those precepts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358437/#Comment_358437" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T05:12:26+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  5:12AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would include them if it makes sense.

When players are directly confronted with these ideas and choices, no shit it makes a lot of people uncomfortable. If it didn't... that would be an even bigger issue.<br/><br/>It's interesting that the proposed options seem to be 1) keep the genocide but remove the women and children so it's not obvious, or 2) don't assume the game is kinda about genocide in the first place.  Personally, though it was probably different when I was a kid and just wanted to kill things, I think option 1 would make me incredibly uncomfortable nowadays, and I would much prefer a game and playstyle that didn't assume that killing everyone was a viable option.<br/><br/>Really, seems like this is a larger problem in games where fighting is the most interesting mechanical thing you can do (and the only thing that everyone is good at), so violence has to be at the core of the experience, but where the things you're fighting are typically other people.  So, the GM's job is to make sure you get into violent conflicts with other people, rather than just setting up the situation and seeing how you choose to deal with it, in a system where there are a bunch of different viable options.  I mean, games like Dogs, the Mountain Witch, Burning Wheel, and AW are set up to make statements about violence, what it's like, and what it leads to, but most fighty dungeony games often seem to be intentionally trying to avoid that, at least mechanically, which is what creates a lot of discomfort when it comes up in play, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358456/#Comment_358456" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T06:52:25+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  6:52AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I say keep the woman and children in, after all, they are fantastic women and children.

And it's poison to the D&amp;D games?</blockquote>\nYes, pretty much.<br/><br/>You need to understand, I'm a very focused gamer. When I sit down to play and it's a game I know, it's all going to be diamond-sharp Creative Agenda Fulfillment from the first second on. I'm all for dramatic games of soul-gazing, but I don't want that in my D&amp;D campaign: the campaign is about success and failure of a bunch of footloose adventurers in a world that can be both cruel and grand, and having a <i>moral dimension</i> be the matter of contention in the game would derail this. Morals are there, but they are <i>scrupples</i>, personally chosen limitations, handicaps and simple features of who is facing what challenges in what way.<br/><br/>Imagine it: a player has succeeded in winning against impossible odds, and then the GM marches the victims of his ambition through his character's newly-built castle's yard, where he can see the widows and crying children of his enemies being forced off into prison camps. The player futilely demands for fair treatment of the vanquished, but the GM brings in a parade of vapid and cruel underlings tied down by their medieval mores, refusing and incapable of understanding his wish to not be tarred as a monster. It is clear that the GM is now driven to prove that the player's struggle for victory was inconceived to begin with, and he's the real monster of the story. This is certainly great drama, but the GM who is doing this in a D&amp;D game (as we play it here) would be stepping outside his purview: the GM has no right to moral provocation in this game, it's not the subject matter and it's not for him to be the accuser. It's as if the Banker in Monopoly refused to shut up about the poor tenants who're going to be left homeless when I build my hotel.<br/><br/>I want to emphasize that the player characters do have morals in this mode of play, and they are limited by those morals, but at no point are they a creative stake: we are not playing to discover how far my character is willing to go, as I already know that. Whether my character is the sort who'd kill goblin babies to sell their ears, or an honorable hero who would never raise his arms against the helpless, we're just going to accept these statements at their face value and move accordingly to the real meat of discovery: for this character with this nature and means, is it possible to overcome this challenge?<br/><br/>(As for realizing that they are the bad guys, my players have had these realizations a few times. It's an amusing ironic insight in the literary sense of the term, though: the players recognize that their characters are going about their business in the worst traditions of European imperialism. Some of the characters are bothered by these realizations, trying to change, while others are not; the players are all amused regardless, as we know that the moral dimension of our choices is not being judged, but rather we're all just excited to see what happens next.)<br/><br/>I know that others have had different experiences with D&amp;D, using it to play - dare I say it - narrativist campaigns. I certainly don't agree with the idea that such a direction would be the only or best way to handle D&amp;D. The game has some remarkable tools for gamist adventures, but not so much in the way of narrativism support. The goblin babies are a red herring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358459/#Comment_358459" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T07:04:34+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  7:04AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>If I recall correctly, his answer was basically to raise them up right, so that they achieve a state of grace and Goodness.

Maybe it's because I don't find tactical, grid-based combat games fun at all and therefore have always viewed D&amp;D as an imperfect vehicle for telling the stories that <i>do</i> interest me.  I've always found a way to make it work even when the game's solution to every problem is, "I hit it with my axe."<br/><br/>Now I know this whole conversation got started because of something in a D&amp;D module, but I'd like to see it expand a little bit to encompass the general idea of noncombatants in violent situations.  I got into a hell of a pickle a couple of years ago for talking about a Vietnam War-era game that would have necessarily included this sort of thing, so I'd appreciate knowing a bit more about how people feel about the issue and how they deal with it in the various games they run.  Maybe that would necessitate another thread, but it seems on point enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358465/#Comment_358465" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T08:05:38+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  8:05AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was a really long time ago, by my recollection was that it was the <i>paladin</i> who convinced everyone in our group to slaughter everything in Keep on the Borderlands, under the rationale of orcs being "abominations in the eyes of god" or such like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358466/#Comment_358466" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T08:08:32+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  8:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>If I recall correctly, his answer was basically to raise them up right, so that they achieve a state of grace and Goodness.

He put all kinds of shit in those modules just because it would be cool or funny or would fuck with the players.  That was the purpose of those kids. To fuck with the players.<br/><br/>This is how we felt. <br/><br/>We felt trolled.<br/><br/>I don't even think removing non-combatants solves the problem for me and my friends. We had just as much a problem fighting the combatants because really\u2026 they are just defending themselves\u2026 from us!<br/><br/>These are human like creatures that don't feel very monster like, combatants included. They are intelligent, have families, language, and seemingly are living peacefully in a cave\u2026 minding their own business. They are even surrounded by other "monster" humanoids living in caves nearby, seemingly peacefully co-existing. The only threat destabilizing this situation is\u2026 the "heroes". <br/><br/>So if this module is intended to teach us a lesson, we stop playing the module! We go in as young inexperienced treasure seekers, rationalizing that it's ok because we're fighting monsters, only to realize that we suck. Our characters go home, maybe get a real job, or look for real monsters to fight. Meanwhile, we (the players) wasted our money because we didn't get to use the module. If this is the story we wanted to experience, we didn't need the module to do it. <br/><br/>Let me underline, for us, removing children Orcs doesn't solve the problem.  The Orc children just makes the underlining issues more blatant and difficult to ignore (for us).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358467/#Comment_358467" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T08:21:08+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  8:21AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With a single axis alignment system this becomes interesting if all orcs are chaotic, the Lawful thing would be to kill them and the neutral thing could be whatever.

I imagine we all agree that that doesn't make it a waste, right?  You don't need to experience every single bit of content...I'm assuming.  But if your party travels to the Keep and apprehends the situation at the Caves, conducts a raid or two into them before becoming sick with themselves and trying to figure out a way to make things right -- that's a waste?  Is there some tipping point of content consumption that you can identify or is it entirely vague and based on whether you feel like you were tricked? <br/><br/>I've played Keep where we just butchered everything and I've played where we talked our way in and helped organize a neutral zone and productive trade between the folks at the keep and the nonhumans.  The second experience was superior to the first -- not in any way a waste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358479/#Comment_358479" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T09:03:03+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  9:03AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2012 9:03AM by jenskot.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good question. <br/><br/>We played 17% of Keep in the Borderlines before running into these issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358481/#Comment_358481" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T09:24:03+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  9:24AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>We're part of a weekly gaming experiment where every week we are running the Caves of Chaos in a different system in an art gallery.</blockquote>\nYou NYC'ers have pretty much the coolest gaming scene ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358482/#Comment_358482" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T09:25:51+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  9:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tavis gets all the credit for this specific experiment!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358483/#Comment_358483" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T09:30:18+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  9:30AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Good question.<br/><br/>We played 17% of Keep in the Borderlines before running into these issues.</blockquote>\nI should note that looking at KotB, the marketing text doesn't promise anything in particular beyond teaching you how to run your first dungeon.

To look out for others. Evil creatures are aggressively selfish, they'll cause harm to others to serve themselves. Neutral creatures look out for themselves so long as it doesn't hurt anyone else too much.<br/><br/>All of these have justifications for battle and killing. It's still D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Monsters don't have listed alignments. This is different from D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The idea is to sidestep a lot of the horrible genocidal behavior that comes along with entire evil species and with evil defined as just kind of bad. Part of how the way it does that is by making it so that alignment does not as directly equate to what the players fight. An army led by a Good king could still be a problem. The king wants to establish a great empire which will give peace and prosperity to the world, but to do that he has to wage war on the PC's home city, killing innocents in the process. The king could even be an orc. There's no real evil here, just competing goods: the good of the city's welfare and the good of a peaceful empire.<br/><br/>Now that evil isn't the only justifier for creating adventures for good characters all the humanoid creatures are freed from their shackles or prescribed alignment. Orcs can still be a threat in their warbands, but they don't have to be evil about it. They could be waging a fair war over territory. Or there could still be some evil orcs that do fight to, say, eradicate humankind. Alignment isn't how you know what to fight.<br/><br/>I think that's what really skeeves me out about Caves of Chaos: these creatures are supposed to be "evil" but that's just kind of stated, not portrayed. Evil defined like that doesn't require action, it's just a state of being, which means that it can apply to noncombatants, which makes it really weird. But it's also a key signifier of what to fight: you kill evil stuff.

This conflict is in the original module but I'm emphasizing it even more. In this case, I have the Greengrin goblinoid alliance (hobgoblins, goblins, and bugbears) against the Blackspear orcs and their gnoll allies. Both sides have been raiding the surrounding countryside, slaughtering crofters, stealing pigs, etc. This tribal feud is threatening to escalate into an all-out war. So the PCs do actually have some justification for trying to... well, stop them from doing that, either by violence or diplomacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the problem with these situations in old school D&amp;D; is that the game says (somewhere or other) that these humanoids are inherently evil. In other words, even if you make the goblin kids into altar boys at the church of Heironeous, they will ultimately turn to theft, murder, demonolatry, and worse. They are enemies of humankind and all that is good. So you might as well kill them. That is just how things stand in the Manichaean cosmos of Gygax. But as normal human beings, I think we as players have a hard time buying into that. So that even if your character knows the goblin kids are vile spawn of Maglubiyet, it still doesn't sit well with <i>you</i> to put them to the sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nSage, sounds to me like you're going in the right direction with the DW alignment system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I'm still not sure how I want to handle this with my conversion of the Caves. Now I'm actually leaning toward leaving the noncombatants in, and seeing what the PCs do. If humanoids are not inherently evil, that removes the in-fiction moral justification for killing them, at least as far as I can tell. That definitely puts the PCs in a spot, but in a different, perhaps more interesting way than before.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, the real villains in my conversion are the evil priest and his ilk. I actually made them into a Cult of Orcus front, with the evil priest Sabazius trying to raise an undead army to conquer the Keep and the surrounding area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358505/#Comment_358505" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T11:44:14+00:00" title="February  9, 2012 11:44AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few years ago I ran a Burning THAC0 event at Chicago Gameday where the players took the roles of the various humanoid leaders in the Caves (idea suggested by Kublai not he BW boards).

That said, an alignment that says that about the real world, even if not meant to apply, makes me feel icky.<br><br>I hope that the other part of alignment alleviates the problem somewhat: in DW alignment is what you strive for, what your inner self desires. A person who harms others through no fault of their own, without the desire to do so, is not evil in our system. I don't know that much about autism, but that would seem to avoid casting it as evil, since there isn't a desire for putting yourself above others, just a challenge in understanding the effect of your actions on others.<br/><br/>And yes, the innermost desire bit does allow for good people doing evil things and vice versa.

The broken case where the Lawful Good Paladin is a selfish bastard who throws others under the bus for his own good is subject to the opinions of everyone else at the table. Instead of cut and dried "you did an evil thing, now you're evil" you can keep your alignment so long as everyone at the table can believe that your character still holds that idea.

Yes, such situations can create interesting and engaging moral dilemmas. It can also be a gobsmack (yes, I just noun-ified it) that sucks all the fun and enjoyment out of play. Sometimes and for some people D&amp;D is a game about destroying monsters and taking their stuff, without the baggage of having to decide if killing imaginary fantasy creatures is morally bankrupt. Which is why I recommended turning the humanoids into actual monsters with no doubt of their nature, instead of very human-like tribal analogs.<br/><br/>I don't think that's a bad thing, and that it's important to keep in mind that this is a game and that the harm and death and mayhem is all imaginary. I mean, we all know how we feel about this sort of thing when it happens in real life, right? I think the problematic part of situations like those presented in the Caves of Chaos is the mixed signals given out by the game. I really doubt it was meant to cause an emergent and complex moral narrative and is more likely along the lines of what JDCorely is saying. And even more likely is that, and no one is surprised here I think, that D&amp;D just tends to be really incoherent right off the shelf.<br/><br/>One thing I do find interesting is that The Keep on the Borderlands is a module that was included with a basic boxed set of the game that was, from what I understand, aimed at teens and pre-teens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358556/#Comment_358556" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T15:59:38+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  3:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a neat topic because I always wanted to publish an idea that I began creating/DMing called  "SLAUGHTER AT THE CAVES OF CHAOS".  Wherein my players created the "last monster standing" of his chosen humanoid race  (that was listed in the original KotBL module).  I then set them out in a  "reverse dungeon" campaign!   The idea being these  "last of their kind"  monsters would begin the campaign in the middle of action as the "heroes" adventuring party was in the middle of the dungeon crawl.  <br/><br/>The GNOLL (Ranger) regaining consciousness, waking from under a pile of corpses of his tribe.<br/>The GOBLIN (anti-paladin) cowering in a bolt-hole watching the "hero-party" leave his tribe's hole.<br/>The MINOTAUR (priest)  "safe" in his mini-labyrinth peering out of the thicket to see the wagons of gold being gathered by the "hero-party" outside the Caves.<br/>A HUMAN member of the evil-cult within the caves, fleeing as the "hero-party" burns his cult's evil temple.<br/>etc... etc...<br/><br/><br/>The idea of the campaign  (after the opening  "ESCAPE"  part of the adventure)  being to go out and both - seek revenge and find other members of their species,  in a world they'd NEVER been outside of the realm,  not even knowing IF there were other tribes in other realms to seek out!  <br/><br/>My players began calling the  "hero-party"  ...  "those damned pink-skinned murderers"  or  "those bastard pinkies!"   (all of them - human, elf, dwarf, etc...  begin white/pink skinned!) ... and they imagined taking the roles of the "hordes" but for  "monster-morality"  reasons,  going out and  invading  towns,  burning,  etc...  <br/>And to *help* them with their player rational -  I really REALLY did play up the brutality in descriptions of the  "Pinkies"  as they slaughtered  humanoid tribes  (yes - women/children)  to literal extinction in the Caves of Chaos.<br/><br/><br/>Honestly... I felt that it was an actual interesting  (read: fun)  take at a campaign to be able to  "play"  evil based characters from unique points of view.  Allowing them to  ACT  like monsters, but actually having a fair  (although monster)  point-of-view  and  get to ENJOY the evil ways...  all with the brutality of the "heroes" of the Keep on the Borderlands as example of what  "good" "heroes"  are[?]...  Heroes??  Seriously??  <br/><br/>The campaign didn't last long  (due to player out-of-game things, not the story itself)  but I wish it had.

How many game designs have been inspired by moments like that? Sometimes the players will discover mechanical and narrative possibilities they hadn't imagined, and this will drive them to find more effective ways to generate those experiences. Sometime the players will absolutely hate what happens and will be driven to create means of structuring play so that they will never have an experience like it again.

That was some of our favorite parts of those sorts of modules.  I've played with parties where the players killed them all by dashing their heads against the cave wall because "why dull a good sword killing babies" (yeah, that was a Evil party) and I've played where the women were spared and allowed to leave with the kids.  I remember one campaign where the players had a "favorite charity".  It started out as kind of a running joke of coming home to the horrible orphanage where 2 of the characters grew up (I know, right) and donating tons of gold in order to buy the place, fire all the vile workers and make it a nice place for the orphans.  The running joke was that since the only professionals available to be hired outside of sages were henchmen with levels that they were actually creating a school training up orphans to be henchmen for adventurers (cue Dr. Xavier jokes here).  Later on when they cleared out a next of kobolds they encountered a creche full of young and realized that the kobolds they just killed were the caretakers.  So they gathered them up and took them back to the orphanage to be raised...and after that there were common speaking kobolds living and working as citizens in that city...since by then the party pretty much owned the city no one said boo about it (to their faces anyway).  I think later they added some gnolls and sahuagan...I think it was sahuagan...some kind of fish people who wound up living in the river and canals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358570/#Comment_358570" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T17:03:54+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  5:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2012 5:05PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite>Is this such a terrible thing? Is it a bad thing at all?</blockquote>Whether that's terrible or not seems to depend on the spirit in which the helpless orc babies scenario is introduced, and how well it fits into your specific game.<br/><br/>There's no reason why it couldn't be done well, inspiring creative possibilities, energizing the group, and so on.  Sadly, there's also no reason why it couldn't be done very badly, just fucking up everyone's fun for the hell of it.<br/><br/>I think why so much of it ends up in the latter category has a lot to do with those old modules.  You'd read them and think, okay, this is how adventures are built: you make a map like this, you put in these kinds of monsters, you plan for this climactic battle in the final room, and somewhere in the middle you have a room where the PCs are put in a shitty moral conundrum that lets you ding the paladins or the thieves or everyone because ROLEPLAYING.  If the players aren't agonizing over a decision because they aren't sure just how the GM is planning to fuck them over for whatever choice they make, you're doing it wrong.<br/><br/>It's that kind of thoughtless, rote setup that wrecks it for everyone, I think.  Ideally, you'd only have those situations in a game because you thought very carefully about what the group wants to explore in play, and laid out the groundwork that would put the situation in context (within the game's setting, its cosmology, etc.), and what that situation will mean to the players and to their characters.  It wouldn't be there because it's room 23, about halfway into the dungeon and therefore time to mess with their heads -- it would be there because it is being offered as a genuine opportunity to inspire creative play and make this game session better.<br/><br/>The module obviously can only offer thoughtless, rote setups: the writers didn't know you or your group or what you liked.  (Sometimes I'm not even sure they knew what THEY liked; those old modules often had a patchwork, kitchen-sink feeling to them.)  This is why modules are so hit-and-miss, and why most of the people I played with made very sure to state up front whether they were planning on running a module exactly as written (translation: "Parts of this are going to be really dumb and suck, because it's not meant for our specific game") or if they were going to adapt it to fit what we were doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358573/#Comment_358573" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T17:37:36+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  5:37PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's kind of like (but not the same) when a GM says, " I know we all agreed to play heroes in a fantasy lighthearted sword and sorcery game" fast forward a few hours or even a few sessions, "but you're actually all prisoners in a depressing scifi world where your criminal's brains are hooked up to virtual reality thingies... what do you do now?" <br/><br/>If this is good or bad depends on your specific group. One size does not fit all.<br/><br/>It depends on your social contract. I would guess in general, you are breaking the social contract and it's going to annoy quite a few people. How quickly you convert that annoyance to surprise to excitement will depend on how skillful the execution is (and the bar is likely being set very high). It's a gamble. I've had it happen one time where it was AMAZING (like the first Matrix movie) and four times where it tanked the entire game (and in two cases, the group).<br/><br/>My preferred gaming style is filled with moral challenges, questioning themes, and killing sacred cows. I love the style! I want to play a game where I ask myself, "damn, maybe we shouldn't be attacking these goblins." <br/><br/>But much more important, my preferred social style is... honesty!<br/><br/>If I'm going to run this style of game, I'm going to be up front about it. Unless my friends tell me, "anything goes, surprise us." Which has happened, and is fun! But I'm going to do whats fun for my friends. I'm not here to teach them a surprise lesson.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358577/#Comment_358577" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T18:40:30+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  6:40PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>and somewhere in the middle you have a room where the PCs are put in a shitty moral conundrum that lets you ding the paladins or the thieves or everyone because ROLEPLAYING.

Not so much that this was a great moral choice, well executed, but that there is something valuable in offering players provocative situations that they were not expecting when they say down to play, and that they are not fully prepared to handle.<br/><br/>Finding baby orcs in a dungeon probably doesn't meet that criteria anymore, since (as Accounting pointed out) it has become just another adventuring cliche. But it's not the spirit of "trolling the players" that's wrong so much as the execution (trolling the players in a formulaic way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

For one thing, FANTASY. For another, this may well be an advance outpost of the hordes of Chaos, you can strip out the home aspect, make it more military-barracks style, and it still makes sense. (I forget how much the module talks about the background of the Caves of Chaos. My recollection is that the concept is that it's a known den where the forces of Chaos are gathering to threaten the civilized world, and they're already causing trouble for the surrounding area. But that may not actually be stated at all.)<br/><br/>I don't know whether you're in the Adventurer's Guild and have access to the current beta of DW, but in the chapter on Fronts, one of the default Dangers, or categories of Fronts, is "Cursed Places", which would fit the general theme of the Caves of Chaos, and one of the moves for Cursed Places is "Vomit forth a lesser monster". That immediately had me thinking of the classic arcade game Gauntlet with its monster generators. I would be inclined to go that route with the Caves of Chaos. There's already a Shrine of Chaos in the caves, tended by an evil human cult that does threaten civilization with its plans to bring chaos and death down on the order of the duchy. So just say that the presence of this shrine has gradually tainted the other caves and caused them to start spawning monstrous humanoids\u2014in much the same way that it was once believed that maggots spontaneously generated from spoiling food and garbage. These are the forces the cult is growing to enact its evil plans.<br/><br/>You want moral dilemmas, run "Dogs in the Caves". (Which actually could be pretty awesome. The PCs are also servants of Chaos, giving them both moral authority over the caves' inhabitants and also reason not to just ride in and kill them as in straight D&amp;D. But once the different factions start bringing their problems to the PCs\u2026)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358613/#Comment_358613" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T03:15:37+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  3:15AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If they're green you can kill them, especially if you're a paladin.

They are even surrounded by other "monster" humanoids living in caves nearby, seemingly peacefully co-existing. The only threat destabilizing this situation is\u2026 the "heroes".<br/>\n<br/>\nThis all just isn't so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe humanoids (and humans in the Shrine of Evil Chaos part) are actively working against mankind. Note the many references to the fact that they attack and eat people (note especially room <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2324&amp;Mode=like">#24</a>, the hobgoblin torture chamber and those imprisoned there). Note that the Shrine has undead and operatives working in the Keep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is explicit mention in the adventure that there are competing factions within the Caves (the section "Tribal Alliances and Warfare," not to mention many mentions within room descriptions of the humanoids preying on each other). The whole thing is already unstable without the intervention of any "heroes."<br/>\n<br/>\nThat the inhabitants of the Caves are a danger to mankind shouldn't even be in question. The fact that they breed is irrelevant to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I do agree that baby orcs as "alignment gotcha!" is crap, but I just removed morality from alignment and problem solved. The decision of what to do with the humanoid children then has nothing to do with the rules of the game, nothing to do with pleasing the DM, it's entirely up to the players what to do and how to handle it. My favorite sort of dilemma because it's all on the players to hash it out amongst themselves! Also note, that if playing straight D&amp;D; by the book, the Keep was written for the basic rules so there's no Good or Evil in the alignment system and no paladins either by the book.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe module doesn't explicitly lay out a plot or provide a lot of detail in a lot of areas (the characters aren't even named!), but the setup so obviously suggests that events are in motion here. To present the Keep and the Caves as a static, mindless "go room to room and kill the greenskins" shows that the DM is either a beginner or just not bothering to try very hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358624/#Comment_358624" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T05:11:12+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  5:11AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 5:12AM by GB_Steve.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> so why try harder?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358628/#Comment_358628" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T05:30:56+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  5:30AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 6:00AM by jenskot.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, I see where you are coming from, and those elements do exist in the Caves of Chaos but:<br><br>START SPOILERS<br><br>You encounter young noncombatants as early as room 6.<br><br>You often start off in area A, where it says that the Kobold guards primarily attack intruders.

It's difficult to understand how to take it seriously. It was written for players to go in, kill the monsters and take the treasure, not really from any kind of story gaming perspective. It's no wonder it doesn't hold up to any serious scrutiny.<br/><br/>As for whether you should have killing children as a dilemma in a game with more modern sensibilities, that's really up to the group you play with. It's not as if child combatants aren't a modern concern, but I'm not sure it's one I want to encounter in much of my gaming. That's not to say that it should be avoided. A friend ran a succesful game of Call of Cthulhu in which the PCs were West African child soldiers.<br/><br/>It is interesting to confront absolutism with relativist choices. Of course if you save the children, because you think they aren't tarnished by the sins of their fathers, then there could be a serious problem with feeding them, especially if their diet is mostly the flesh of sentients. Still, it would offer a solution as to what to do with their dead parents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358642/#Comment_358642" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T07:17:29+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  7:17AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>James, I see where you are coming from, and those elements do exist in the Caves of Chaos but:<br/><br/>START SPOILERS<br/><br/>You encounter young noncombatants as early as room 6.<br/><br/>You often start off in area A, where it says that the Kobold guards primarily attack intruders.

And on top of that both outcomes go too far away from the main story and create a totally new one, which can be a bit annoying to some players, particularily the ones that were interesting in the original module and wanted to see the dungeon to the end without a change in the mood of the story.<br/><br/>I'd say, to unlock the potential of the room you have to give it purpose. Say, the babies (either from monsters or human) are kept for food or sacrifice, perhaps they belong to another tribe of humanoids that can either help or attack the party depending on what they do with the babies. Perhaps killing the babies starts a ritual that would later affect the party, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358647/#Comment_358647" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T08:07:16+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  8:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 8:08AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It just occurred to me that I look at B2 in direct contrast to B1 (the first D&amp;D adventure I ever played).  B1 is fucking nuts.  There's no rhyme or reason for anything -- the epitome of kitchen sink module design.  (It's OK, though, a goofy old wizard did it, so it makes sense!)  And by contrast, B2 is a living breathing eco-system; a master-stroke of realism.  OF COURSE there are women and children.  And it's got nothing to do with messing with the players' heads.  The authors couldn't care less about the moral dimension of things (though I have no idea what they really thought, I'm describing the context in which eleven-year-old me hit the Caves of Chaos).  I suspect that moral test, for the groups that even experienced it is an emergent property, though it's obvious that others disagree.<br/><br/>And I think I'm totally with Ralph on not really understanding.

A gang of human bandits hiding out in their lair don't usually come with families attached - they're badass outcasts from society living in a cave eating squirrel.

ANYONE WHO DOESN'T WANT CONTEXT, SKIP THIS PART NOW... <br/><br/><i>Since I run RPG events, I've gotten the pleasure (and for me it's a deep pleasure, I love different people and experiencing different things) to game extensively with people of every generation. I've gamed with over a 1,000 people, from all over the world. Personally I came into gaming at the tail end of 2E, helped playtest both 3E, 4E, Pathfinder, and am following 5E very, very closely. I was previously ignorant of anything before 2E but that's changed now as I've gamed with many people from that generation and earlier, including gaming with Mike from Gary Gygax's original group, gaming with Gygax, and gaming with people who played with Gygax later in his life. I'm amazed how each generation is so different. And with those difference come vastly different expectations. I also come from a creative director / marketing / usability / interface design background and my job has involved lots of research, playtesting, and understanding what people want and why. And since I love gaming, it's all merged into one for me. If I was an Academic, I could easily write a novel on all this. It's also helped me become a pretty good GM!</i><br/><br/> ...STOP SKIPPING NOW.<br/><br/>Back to expectations!<br/><br/>If we have no expectations playing B2, there is little wrong with Kobold children. <br/><br/>If we're coming from a 3E / 4E background, in many cases (not all), the assumption is we are heroes (there are exceptions). In Pathfinder, they took this a step further with their Adventure Paths and explicitly made Dungeon Monsters as monstrous as possible. I have Paizo freelance friends who were told their monsters were too human and to monster them up. In some culture's basic story telling, your heroism is limited by the villainy of the monsters. You can only be as heroic as the thing you overcome is villainous. Pathfinder has mastered this. The dungeon is built specifically to make you feel more heroic. All of things brings expectations. <br/><br/>The first culture clash I experienced gaming with my OD&amp;D friends (who play lots of other games as well) is the idea is that we're not heroes. You may come out of the dungeon a hero. Or your experience may later allow you to do heroic things. But going in your are not a hero. We're either commoners put into desperate situations, mercenaries, or people who are a little crazy (thrill seekers). With of course exceptions (assume this is always the case). <br/><br/>The only relevance of kobold children being encountered so early in the dungeon (room 6) is that the dungeon itself, later on, does a great job of setting expectations. You start to discover how evil some of these humanoids are. You start to see what's at stake. You start to see the threat that's building and needs to be stopped or the common people will suffer dearly. If you're a player who needs this justification to go deeper into the dungeon, it's amply provided. But before you get to that you encounter something that humanizes the situation, and makes you question if you should push forward. If your expectations are, "of course we should push forward, that's what this game is about" or "we're heroes", then you're going run into a lot of social contract issues. <br/><br/>This is happening now with the D&amp;D 5E playtests. They are running B2 with updated rules but keeping all the content intact. But it's non OD&amp;D players playing this content for the first time, and it's majorly clashing with their expectations. <br/><br/>Now personally, I find almost everything is more enjoyable without expectations. <br/><br/>But that's not usually what happens. I'm just reporting what I'm seeing. I don't even know if this good, bad, or anything at all. It's mainly interesting to me and another chapter of exploring and living this fascinating hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358658/#Comment_358658" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T09:17:30+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  9:17AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Felan</cite><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>and somewhere in the middle you have a room where the PCs are put in a shitty moral conundrum that lets you ding the paladins or the thieves or everyone because ROLEPLAYING.

The point isn't that difficult moral and ethical situations are a bad thing in RPGs, it's that "But wait there are kobold babies! MIIINDFREEEAK" is a stupid, uninspired, and<i>boring</i>example. There are so many great examples of moral-ethical conundrums in fantasy fiction (kill Gollum or let him guide the way to Mordor, remain loyal to the Night's Watch or ride with Robb Stark) but kobold babies are<i>not equivalent</i>.<br/><br/>A little late to the party here, but this kind of "moral dilemma" reminds me of the "moral dilemmas" in Mass Effect 1, a sort of false choice.  "Hey, random passerby, I don't know whether I should have a surgery that puts my unborn child in jeopardy!"  "Hey, random passerby, I want to make the military release my wife's remains instead of using them for science!"  And somehow, the choice you make reflects on whether you're an altruistic or selfish person.

I'm running it at Dreamation using the original Moldvay rules. Most of the time that I run it, it's in a sort of ironic-nostalgia way. I tell people that we're playing a set of rules older than they are, and that we'll adhere closely to those rules as written. We laugh at some of the seeming strangeness of those rules compared to what they're used to. Part of that experience is the "wtf?" of exposure to an older way of thinking, so I include the orc babies (though few groups ever reach them in the one-shots I run).  So that's the Adam Dray B2 experience.<br/><br/>In general, though, I am growing increasingly intolerant of genocidal mania in my D&amp;D games. <a href="https://plus.google.com/113487474363395041666/posts/cXciKTaESA7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">I wrote a lot about this on G+ a few months ago.</a> Never mind killing orc babies; I don't enjoy watching PCs slaughter tribes of adult orc warriors in their homes. I'm not sure if it's worse when the PCs are Chaotic or Lawful. It's just sickening. <br/><br/>As a result, my Labyrinth Lord (Basic D&amp;D clone) "Hinterlands" campaign isn't about the humanoids. There are orc tribes (that are a lot like Gauls) and a kingdom of demon-worshiping goblins (a kingdom the PCs haven't found yet) and a warren full of Kender-inspired kobolds that are kind-hearted pests without conventional ideas about property, but the party doesn't see them as cattle for the slaughter. There have been a number of violent encounters with humanoids, for sure, but it's largely been fights with individual humanoids. One of the rogue goblins at the Dwarven Well threatened the party and he got <i>webbed</i>, and then his lieutenant saw his opportunity and killed him. One of the kobolds pissed off the party and he got smashed in the face, but there are six other kobolds who follow the party around (scavenging, mostly, but helping here and there). They had a cautious parlay with an orcish scouting party and got some useful intelligence from them (but the orcs also tried to trick the party into taking a dangerous route around the lake).<br/><br/>There's plenty of violence in the campaign, but the party is fighting non-sentient monsters: so far, they've fought giant spiders, stirges, a carrion crawler, a gelatinous cube, skeletons and zombies, and a giant cave-octopus. The game is not poorer for its treatment of humanoids as intelligent beings worthy of life. There's plenty of monsters for heroes to kill, and humanoids exist freely and are dangerous, but no one seems to think of them as talking experience points.<br/><br/>If any of the party did decide to slaughter a weak and defenseless victim, I'd probably describe the victim as curling up in the fetal position or clinging to the "hero's" ankle as he was slaughtered. Because real heroes don't do that shit.<br/><br/>I don't think I would include B2's Caves of Chaos, as written, in my Hinterlands campaign. It's basically a group of Evil humanoid tribes that need killing. There's no justification for why they're attacking the Keep; they're already dehumanized before the PCs arrive. <br/><br/>To include them, I'd have to humanize them, and that means inventing a reason they're fighting the humans. Maybe it's just greed and territory expansion--it's not like real-life people haven't done worse for less. But with that understanding, there'd have to be other ways for the heroes to drive them back. Demoralize them. Frighten them. Make treaties. The babies and other noncombatants would add a moral component that I do enjoy in my D&amp;D, and my players would not be surprised by it. If taken back to an orphanage or otherwise raised in human society, the orc babies would grow up and have a variety of complex lives, just like real orphans from a minority background.

However, I was struck by how an equally valid reading of the text would be:<br/><br/>1- these are ordinarily referred to as "orc guards" or just "orcs" rather than by gender, so you could go either way and make different tribes more like lions and hyenas or more like chimps and wolves<br/>2- the race of the "females" and "children" isn't specified; what if they are actually human captives?<br/>3- the bad-ass females could be the actual matriarchical council; the job of the "chieftain" could be to beat heads with his high hit dice, according to the orders of the tough wise-women<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is especially exciting to me because:<br/>a) the hall guards are now keeping captives in as well as intruders out: exciting tension!<br/>b) human slavery could be why the Keep wants these tribes wiped out: heroic motivation!<br/>c) another structural problem with B2 is that in most rule systems, if the women are allowed to fight the PCs are likely to get murderized by even-huger-than-usual waves of enemies, so if they are actually human captives you get: potential allies (free and arm the women!) and tactical goals (keep the children safe!)<br/>d) if you believe as I often do that "evil" and "chaos" mean "violating human taboos" then you have a reason for why the humanoids keep these captives, e.g. to sell to the Temple of Evil Chaos, to bring to services there to show how evil they are, etc.: grindhouse material ranging from '70s pulp spiciness to full-on horrorshow action, but either way squick which the PCs are preventing instead of perpretrating<br/>e) a low-level tie-in to the kind of domain management stuff I find exciting with Adventurer Conqueror King: OK now you have freed 70 women and 100 children, they have been soiled by chaos or are some kind of weird foreigners so they are no longer welcome in the Keep, how are you going to set them up in a village and keep them protected and fed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358756/#Comment_358756" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T15:27:47+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  3:27PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's actually useful stuff, Tavis.

Just as the sleeping foes are about to be "dealt with," in comes a child, clutching the equivalent of a teddy bear (a stuffed real human baby), saying in broken common, "What are you doing to my daddy?"<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch the players freak out, and then watch half of them freak out even more as the other half "deals with" the orc child.<br/>\n<br/>\nFun humanoid facts:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf humanoid children aren't evil by nature, then slaughtering them is an evil act*. As is leaving them in the lair amidst the gore of their slaughtered relatives after you've dealt with the combatants. But if you bring them back to your civilization, that civilization will want them dead. And if you take them to another humanoid tribe, they're going to be raised as warriors or for breeding warriors. Leave them in the wilderness and they'll get eaten by bears or something. (so of course when I use humanoids, they aren't irredeemably evil, because that reduces complications for the PCs, and wants that?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you just kill them to save the bother, and that * up there means it's evil to us, as players, using real-life morality and the fact that everything that can talk to us is human. But in the game world that isn't so, orcs aren't jews for crying out loud, so for slaughtering the orc kids it's high fives and more scalps for the bounty offered back in town and hearty congratulations for ending the next generation of threat, and if the local mayor or whatever has a problem with that he's obviously an orc collaborator so off with his head too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the players want to take up the cause of the orc kids, OK, but then the human civilization is going to be hostile to them and most likely so will the orcs unless you want to play Dances with Dire Wolves, but when the harsh winter comes you're still their most convenient food source.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LincolnSmash" title="LincolnSmash"><img alt="LincolnSmash" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LincolnSmash">LincolnSmash</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358836/#Comment_358836" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T00:57:16+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 12:57AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might be hilarious to you, Zak, but I don't think it's uncommon or anything.

It's not that inconceivable, people come to the practice from such a multitude of different backgrounds, and some have been doing it for a longer time than others. Just deciding that a problem presented by somebody else is not a real problem for adult people isn't very polite. Rather, how about you try to figure out what it is that you do socially when orc babies come up, and tell that to anybody who might be having trouble with such situations? Like Jim did upthread, he told us that he's defusing the Alignment traps by interpreting Alignment strictly as a Moorcock-like cosmic magical allegiance, with no implications for everyday action in the human sphere. That's an useful hint for others trying to piece together a toolbox of play.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I don't <i>currently</i> have a problem with orc babies in my own play, but that's because I have a solid methodology and a powerful set of gaming tools at hand, so I know what to do with that sort of thing if it comes up in play. If you'd asked me ten years back, I probably would have made a mess of it one way or another. And it would not have been the sort of social embarrassment that seems to often be assumed with politically incorrect subjects - around here it's pretty clear that games are games and the players are not to be judged personally for the content of their play, even if they end up slaughtering orc babies. Rather, I imagine that our problems would have stemmed from the problem that others have described in this thread in detail: we would go into the game with a pretty organic, realistic and serious style of play, and then we're faced with a problem that would have to be addressed in depth and in radical ways to achieve a satisfactory conclusion: because we've been developing our characters and the setting in certain ways, we might not be willing to go for the simple options like slaying orc babies on the spot - it might be contrary to our characters and even the setting mores. We might end up doing one of those pretty ridiculous rigamaroles where you take the children in tow, return to civilization, put up a nursery for the poor babies whose parents we murdered (who does that, except conquistadors?), etc. This would then largely derail the dungeon adventure, which could easily feel like an unjust punishment to the players: the GM is essentially forcing them to choose between maintaining the credence of the fiction by micromanagering orc babies, or discarding their sense of the setting and their characters to continue fulfilling their actual mission. That's a painful situation - I never encountered this orc baby thing myself in my youth, as I didn't play D&amp;D then, but I did not enjoy similar situations when they came up; at the time we followed the fiction wherever it lead us, even when it brought the game to places we didn't know how to get out of.<br/><br/>Also, I'll repeat my current way of handling this, just because it doesn't hurt to focus on solutions: in my current campaign we reduce the ambivalence of these situations by removing Gygaxian humanoid near-human monsters from the game. When you encounter monster babies, you can be certain that they're either going to be essentially human savages, or inherently mostrous inhuman beings like Jim describes above. It's not even going to be difficult to recognize which is which, unless it's a replicant monster that specifically disguises itself as a human child or something like that. This means that the players will have no difficulty acting like good Christians if they wish to: they can make sure that the savage children are taken back to civilization and to the closest church mission, where they'll be taken care of just like any orphans, to pick an arbitrary example. I won't even pretend that the orphanage will be good for the children or that they won't face ethnic discrimination; the important part is that the adventurers are able to fulfill their societally expected duty in the matter, and if the society is cruel about what it expects for its weakest members, well that's going to be true everywhere. At no point will the orc babies become an actual point of contention, they'll just be a minor bit of "treasure" (spoils of war) the players deal with any way they like, with some default options available and known from the start. As I said upthread: it doesn't make sense to make the players be the moral trailblazers in the Indian Wars, when surely the local society knows perfectly well what is the appropriate and accepted way of dealing with orc babies. Maybe they really are Giger-monsters and need to be slain before they grow up, I've no problem with that as long as the GM is clearly on board and doesn't undermine this simple truth just to see the players squirm at the evil deeds of their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358851/#Comment_358851" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T06:13:18+00:00" title="February 11, 2012  6:13AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True story:<br/><br/>Some years ago I ran a convention D&amp;D game (this one, it's in danish: <a href="http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=3401" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=3401</a>) where the enemies were represented on the tactical map by M&amp;Ms -the colours and sizes with/without peanuts were really practical.

Zak, let me paraphrase how I <i>think</i> you see this issue, and you tell me whether I'm understanding your viewpoint: you're saying that the orc babies are not problematic because a sane GM would never make them a problem. If you have an insane GM who's making an issue out of the orc babies, you need to talk it over or swap GMs or something until the problem goes away. If you have a GM who fails on the job because the game veers to an unlikely direction, that's simply not within the realm of Zak Smith's experience - you only ever play D&amp;D with a GM who masters the entire panoply of the tools of his trade, and it's laughably inconceivable that there might be GMs who find these things difficult.<br/><br/>Is the above about right?<br/><br/>The thing is, it seems to me that people who find the orc baby thing difficult are having problems that stem from superficially entirely reasonable assumptions about how the game is to be played, and the game then careens out of control because nobody recognizes the patterns and has effective remedies for stopping unhealthy developments in the game. We can even set aside the hypothetical GM who <i>intentionally</i> starts to deconstruct the role and nature of the adventurer by focusing on the consequences and human suffering caused by the deeds of the player characters; that alone wouldn't be so tricky (just don't do that unless you want that sort of game!) if it weren't entirely possible for a group to end up derailing their play experience with the orc babies <i>accidentally</i>.<br/><br/>Here's how I see it happening, based on the various accounts and concerns people have raised here and elsewhere: the GM introduces a scenario like the Caves of Chaos here, and hooks the adventurers into exploring the caves with rumours of savage monsters and treasure. The group is functional, so the fiction is colorful, people communicate successfully about the action, characters develop in personality, play proceeds logically and organically as a give and take between the players. However, once the adventuring party realizes that they have attacked a tribal unit (instead of a Hollywood logic evil hideout that only conveniently features non-combatants of your own race, ready to be rescued), thing start to get difficult: even if the moral compass of the party is clear and they agree that these particular savages have to be scattered to the winds and the caves cleared to ensure the security of the human settlement, this doesn't really tell the players what to do with the non-combatants: are they committing crimes of war if they slay everybody, or are they ridding the world of evil? Even if it's A-OK to kill the orc women and children, do the players like playing a game where such things are done? The rule-book doesn't provide any answers.<br/><br/>Note that answering the above question non-committally or ignoring it is not an option if you have a good flow going in the game, with full player buy-in on resolving issues in ways true to their characters. The players don't want to just brush it off, they want to discover things about their characters and the world, so they start to think about what to do with the orc babies seriously, in a way that preserves the dignity of their adventurers. So far I don't see anything particularly incredible in this account, this is how roleplaying games often work. There might be a player who recognizes that the game's not built to handle bleeding heart liberals, so he takes an intentionally amoral line, but the others talk him down because they find the situation natural and logical. The orcs are like Native Americans or other primitive savages, so societal reactions and solutions are lifted out of history and player expectations to end up with solutions: perhaps women and children are allowed to escape unmolested, which is actually a pretty functional way to go in the D&amp;D context, but it's also entirely possible for liberal, modern players to get stuck with the option that is in most ways the most problematic: they decide that their characters take moral responsibility for these non-combatants, and start arranging the logistics for saving them from their iniquity and circumstances. Everybody's initially happy, as this supports the idea that the player characters are noble heroes (of a particularly white-bred colonial sort, but if you can't handle imperialistic romanticism then perhaps D&amp;D isn't the game for you to begin with) and it seems that the problematic situation has been resolved well.<br/><br/>Here's where Zak's solution comes into the picture: as I understand your thesis, it is that the GM is responsible for running the game wherever it happens to go, so if the players want to go into the orphanage business, you're willing to make the attempt to make that interesting content for play. Or probably you're going to just make it easy and simple for the players insofar as you run out of good ideas for the moment, so that the orphanage thing is resolved quickly by negotiation so the players can get back into the dungeon. I'm cool with this attitude, it is in fact the way I run the game myself. Just tell the players that it'll cost 10 GP per kid to set them up in a nearby town, and a Charisma check to make sure the locals agree to have an orc orphanage there, or agree to take them into the human orphanage, or whatever. Problem solved, back to the dungeon.<br/><br/>However, our hypothetical GM here might not be as skilled as Zak or I, so he can make any one of several mistakes in dealing with the surprising orc baby situation:<ul><li>He might not realize that he needs to support the players in depicting their adventurers; if he eg. allows the players to bring a bunch of orc kids to town only to have the citizens kill them in most cruel ways ("Ooh, what a twist!"), that's going to cause resentment - the GM should have told the players to begin with that their characters, citizens of this fantasy world, know how this is going to play out.</li><li>Furthermore, the GM might not realize that he needs to be consistent in the moral depiction of his setting: if he allows and enables NPCs to have the luxury of heroic romanticism, as is often the case in D&amp;D, it's going to be messed up if he insists that player characters do not have that same luxury. Either you're going to have a setting with characters the players can look up to, or you're going to have a grim place where nobody is safe from making difficult decisions. It's easy to cause resentment if you first tell the players that the orc wars are essentially a war of genocide, and then turn around to depict some NPCs who are genuinely shocked by the morally horrifying deeds of the player characters.</li><li>Even if the GM has a handle on the moral issues and is going to back the players all the way in what they decide to do, he might not have efficient procedural tools for running a non-combatant situation. Neither the players nor the GM necessarily have the experience that is required to take the D&amp;D system out of the dungeon. The outcome might be that handling the non-combatants in a moral way becomes a ridiculous and boring slog for everybody: maybe it costs more than the characters even can afford to take care of the kids, maybe the local social logistics can't handle these numbers - maybe the adventurers find that their choices are to either become non-adventurers to deal with the consequences of their actions, or they need to go back on their choices and slay (leave exposed to die, whatever) the orc babies after all.</li></ul>\nEven if we assume that everybody at the table is an adult, is it so inconceivable that the group might find it a problem when the spend the second half of their play session figuring out what to do with orc babies, only to realize that hey, actually this adventuring thing is nothing more than racist genocide? The players can surely adjust to this once they realize the situation: when the next adventure rolls around the GM provides compelling stakes and monstrous monsters, say, or the players roll up new characters with a decidedly more cynical approach to life, and the whole group cooperates to depict the setting in a way that makes it socio-psychologically sensible for there to even exist adventurers who go about killing greenskins in their homes. Whichever way the campaign continues, the original situation was a bit of a problem for the inexperienced group.<br/><br/>The big spectre that is howering above this play procedure is deconstruction: if we agree to the full Gygaxian canon, then we're playing D&amp;D in a world that is full of moral hazards without easy solutions. This minefield can be maneuvered by skilled groups that accept the premises, but what about the inexperienced GMs and clueless players who don't even necessarily know when they sit down to play that the game world is in the throes of racial war? They can and do end up with parties breaking down in anger over things like orc babies or discovering that the adventurers they thought heroes are actually murderous thugs. D&amp;D is inherently a violent and patriarchal romance, so players will presumably accept that their characters need to kill and be killed; most groups do, and I imagine that the orc babies are not a problem for the majority of people trying out D&amp;D. However, saying that the entire problem is a non-issue would be far too extreme. I don't think it's useful to just laugh and mock people whose personal approach to D&amp;D hits a snag when it comes to the morality of waging war on the greenskins. After all, as we well know, D&amp;D does no better job at explaining its nature in the game texts as any other roleplaying game: it is often represented as heroic fantasy, and frankly, there is no racist non-combatant problem in heroic fantasy.<br/><br/>As I've described in this thread, my own solution as an experienced GM is to abandon some particular hotspots in the Gygax minefield. I do this basically because I find the default vision of a multiracial world locked into a holy war of genocide between Good and Evil races to be too quirky and non-standard for the adventure fantasy that D&amp;D purports to do; a human-dominant world where brave heroes swash the buckle and occasionally delve into mysteries man is not meant to know suits me better - basically the same sort of thing Jim Raggi runs. No orc baby issues, as I've described earlier. (Interestingly enough a few characters in the campaign got plane-lost a few sessions back and ended up in the bog-standard <i>Splinters of Faith</i> setting; we'll no doubt be getting our share of the orc conundrums there, as I'm running it straight. Depends on whether the players want to play that stuff.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358894/#Comment_358894" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T10:35:06+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 10:35AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2012 10:47AM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "He might not realize that he needs to support the players in depicting their adventurers; "<br/>\n<br/>\n"Furthermore, the GM might not realize that he needs to be consistent in the moral depiction of his setting:"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Even if the GM has a handle on the moral issues and is going to back the players all the way in what they decide to do, he might not have efficient procedural tools for running a non-combatant situation. "<br/>\n<br/>\nThen basically (and I'm sorry to harp on this, but it does seem to be the only way I can parse it) WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS PERSON DOING RUNNING AN RPG?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is like saying "I am trying to write a novel but I don't know how to read or write, can anybody help me out?"<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, all I can say is:<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you really really think you know how to run D&amp;D because you've read caricatures of it on message boards and saw them on The Big Bang theory, _you still have to read the rulebook before playing the game_<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's right there, in the intro to this module, endless caveats saying "Hey buddy, you may have an internet connection and have gone to college, but this isn't easy":<br/>\n<br/>\n" It is now up to you to create a magical realm filled with danger, mystery, and excitement, complete with countless challenges. Though your role is the greatest, it is also the most difficult. You must now prepare to become all things to all people."<br/>\n<br/>\n" Read the module thoroughly; you will notice that the details are left in your hands. This allows you to personalize the scenario, and suit it to what you and your players will find most enjoyable."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Hopefully, they will quickly learn that the monsters here will work together and attack intelligently, if able. If this lesson is not learned, all that can be done is to allow the chips to fall where they may. Dead characters cannot be brought back to life here!"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Anything you can imagine could be part of your world if you so desire. The challenge to your imagination is to make a world which will bring the ultimate in fabu- lous and fantastic adventure to your players."<br/>\n<br/>\n"All of this play, as well as what will come afterwards, requires that the players play the personae (personalities) of the characters that they will have throughout the length of the campaign, much like an actor plays a role in a play. You, however, have a far greater challenge and obligation! You not only must order and create the world, you must also play the part of each and every creature that the player characters encounter. You must be gate guard and merchant, inn- keeper and orc oracle and madman as the situation dictates. The role of DM is all-powerful, but it also makes many demands. It is difficult to properly play the village idiot at one moment and the wise man the next, the noble clergy- man on one hand and the vile monster on the other. In one role you must be cooperative, in the next uncaring and non-commital, then foolish, then clever, and so on. Be prepared!"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Whether the first time you play or the next, the players will set forth to find and explore the many Caves of Chaos. You must describe the journey to the place and what the char- acters see, and allow them to choose how they will go about their adventuring. In such situations, the DM must be a truly disinterested party, giving information as required by questioning and proper action, but neither helping nor hindering otherwise. "<br/>\n<br/>\n"Unlike most boardgames, D&amp;D play relies on information, both from the players and the DM. In boardgames, the way the game is played is obvious. First one person moves, and then another. Actions are limited and choices are few. In this game, the action is only limited by the abilities of the character, the imagination of the player, and the decisions of the DM. The play will often go in unexpected directions and the DM will sometimes be required to decide on situa- tions not covered in the rules."<br/>\n<br/>\n"The players must be allowed to make their own choices. Therefore, it is important that the DM give accurate information, but the choice of action is the players\u2019 decision."<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike what more do you want? A big stamp on the front of the book going "WARNING: <br/>\nYou must be this clever to run this module"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358896/#Comment_358896" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T10:42:31+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 10:42AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the real problem is people assume--just 'cause he made up owlbears--that when Gary wrote that stuff he was joking and actually meant "As a DM your job is to prepare a cutesy wargame for babies".<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, he meant it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what age you are, it's hard.

This discussion isn't about that. I don't think that old D&amp;D game texts out of all things are perfect, but they are sufficient. I've mostly lost any illusions I may have harbored about the "perfection" of game texts; it's such a culturally contextual thing how people engage texts that it's better to just accept that different people need different approaches to successfully learn or communicate things.<br/><br/>That aside, I accept your view on this, Zak. Consulting the topic of the thread, you find problems with non-combatant humanoids a non-issue because people who have trouble with such a basic thing and need to ask questions about it shouldn't even be gamemastering. That makes your credulous reaction to this entire thread entirely understandable.<br/><br/>Now, this is the place where I would be expected to fly into 'roid rage about how you dare be so elitist and uncaring and politically incorrect as to suggest that somebody might be too stupid to master the game.

My own dear hope is that as a game designer I can contribute to producing game texts that help people get over these humps and thus lower the threshold for the hobby. Better instructions and advice (or procedural methodology, as I like to call it) will hopefully enable people to play more successfully and address difficulties they have, including the ones that seem trivial to experienced gamemasters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358898/#Comment_358898" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T11:00:40+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 11:00AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D is a (relatively) simple game with a simple premise with this simple introductory module for a reason:<br/>\n<br/>\nYour players are complicated.

This module is horrifically bad at doing that. <i>Nothing</i> in it makes sense from the perspective of a "living environment", and the game does nothing whatsoever to promote that. The quotes Zak gives are dead on target (though contradictory, which is fine because the role of the DM is a complex one.) The DM's job is to be disinterested, promote excitement, advance their vision of the world (which is wide open to all aspects of imagination, however inconsistent), and personalize the content of the adventure to the players. NOT to create or simulate a "living environment".  Consistency isn't even on the horizon.  No early modules did this, with good reason.

For one thing, the mechanics themselves become an important part of the game's historical/political commentary and emotional impact once the true destination is revealed (it isn't always at the end of the game, and usually people figure it out for themselves pretty quickly), whereas in the orc-babies situation the D&amp;D mechanics don't really have anything to do with the quandary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358991/#Comment_358991" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T20:33:37+00:00" title="February 11, 2012  8:33PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted some thoughts on <a href="https://plus.google.com/113487474363395041666/posts/TQogQ5Sc3u1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google+</a>.<br><br>Jason, by "The game doesn't have much to do with that," are you saying we're playing it wrong?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358994/#Comment_358994" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T21:25:03+00:00" title="February 11, 2012  9:25PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not at all, if you are able to find diamonds in the rough, good on ya!

It's an adventuring environment where players can definitely make their mark. At the same time, take a more realism-oriented gamer, and I totally see how "living environment" would be the last thing in their mind; as has been discussed in passing in this very thread, Gygaxian fantasy is not the most realistic and true-to-life out there when it comes to things like socio-economic credibility, psychological motivations, overall setting consistency and other things a traditional gamer (one who plays games from the '80s onwards) likes. I can well remember how this difference in style made me underestimate D&amp;D through the '90s - I was totally committed to auteurism in GMing through my teenage years, and simply couldn't see the interactive give-and-take that makes up a D&amp;D game, so D&amp;D simply seemed mechanically backwards and fictionally childish in my eyes that expected universal statements about resolution systems, deep personalities for characters and complex GM-prepared plots.<br/><br/>That is to say, I agree with both Jim and Jason.

The key to my understanding D&amp;D anew around 2005-ish (basically, when this OSR thing in the net started gaining steam) was in my deepening literary background. I've been a big fan of Tolkien, Howard, Moorcock, etc. since my teens, and I'd been aggressive about reading more and different stuff all along, but somehow my understanding of fantasy roleplaying stalled around '97 or so - basically, I'd been so heavily gridlocked by the rpg theory and aesthetics presented by BRP games, MERP and such that I had difficulty appreciating weird and phantasmagoric fantasy alongside the romantic, "clean" fantasy ideals advocated by traditional roleplaying. I was like that poor GM in Dork Tower who's always striving to ritually achieve the aesthetics of Tolkien, and uses railroading and poorly conducted stylistic critique of his players as his tools. It's not far from the truth that the gaming culture of the time and place appreciated a deep experience of a well-realized world, but did not have any understanding at all of picaresque and pulp fiction.<br/><br/>I basically had all the cultural building blocks for grogging what D&amp;D was shooting for, having read everything and anything over the years, so my defence is mostly that my main D&amp;D context at the time was 2nd edition AD&amp;D, which is an awful work that tries to force D&amp;D to do the aforementioned dramatic high fantasy that was so important at the time. By the time the Forge rolled around I'd basically discarded D&amp;D as irrelevant. However, over the early years of the Forge I interacted a lot with American roleplayers who tend to have serious D&amp;D backgrounds (much more so than here in Finland; D&amp;D is about as important to us here as Runequest, when it comes to cultural prominence), and perhaps more importantly, with older gamers who had different and often more balanced viewpoints on the entire genre of fantasy. I was introduced to many phantasmagoric, pulp-flavoured fantasy works in this context, as eg. Ralph Bakshi was being continuously name-dropped. There were also formative discussions about gamist roleplaying and the proper utility of both D&amp;D and Tunnels &amp; Trolls are rules-systems - those were important and exciting to me personally, as they showed to me how there actually is stuff happening in D&amp;D on a level completely different from how later games operate. (I'm talking of Ron Edwards &amp; crew here, those old guys are old enough to remember when Tolkien wasn't the be-all-end-all of fantasy.)<br/><br/>When I took a serious look at the 1st edition D&amp;D rules in 2005-ish, it was in an entirely different cultural context than my '90s encounters with AD&amp;D and (to a lesser degree) Mentzer. At the Forge I'd learned to decipher rpg texts in terms of interaction, so this game no longer seemed like a bad tool for setting simulation (which was the extent of my understanding of rpg systems before the millennium); instead, it looked like a good tool for team-based organic-fiction gamist fantasy adventure. What's more, having grown wiser over the years, I no longer had an insatiable thirst for "elves done right, meaning the same way they were done last time around" (basically the artistic imprimatur of the post-Tolkien fantasy genre), and could thus have full appreciation for crude, vivacious fantasy that doesn't just endlessly repeat the hero's journey. In a word, my creative understanding of what D&amp;D even is or can be had been transformed over the intervening decade. The tendency of you OSR guys to emphasize the pulp picaresque over eg. high fantasy and D&amp;D fantasy (nowadays its own genre) made the truth of the matter very plain to see.<br/><br/>I guess my point here is that what D&amp;D is trying to do is much easier to understand if you're researching it as an adult (it's really not much of a kid's game - at least the GM should be adult), are familiar with its literary background (and understand it, too, realizing how it differs from eg. Tolkien) and accept that it's a team-based challenge-game with a referee and strong player control over game pacing and direction (as opposed to a fantasy epic game with a plot-controlling GM, as it was sold through the AD&amp;D 2nd edition era). I spent the '90s denigrating the game for not being what it's not, so nowadays it pains me to see others judge it for not fitting better with later ideals of what a fantasy roleplaying game should look like.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Out of curiosity, did any of those authors write about heroes who killed orc babies, or similar? I mean, even Tolkien avoided the question, right?</blockquote>\nThere are pulp fantasy authors who push the envelope towards racism and social darwinism, so Gygax is not making any great departure in his vision, but even pulp authors tend to be limited in their freedom of expression in a way rpg authors aren't - have to get it past the editor, after all. Definitely similar themes are prevalent in seedier pulp fiction, but usually the author wants to show his hero in an uncontroversially sympathetic light, so he limits himself to heroic slaying of evil peoples in a kill-or-be-killed context. In other words, what Solomon Kane would do to evil babies is never addressed, as there are ample evil people conveniently attacking him all the time. It's probably not any great news that the audiences of pulp fantasy could generally speaking enjoy depictions of heroes who defend the weak, defend themselves and ruin those in power while showing the colored man his proper place in God's plan, while many in that same audience would turn away from extreme racism and other bare right-wing ideologies that might be glimpsed as hints in this genre of literature. The treatment of Gor novels in the genre literature scene is a pretty good example of how it looks when you cross the line of propriety, even if you're just explicit about matters that other writers have said implicitly.<br/><br/>(Because Americans have huge sore spots about these things, I should clarify that I like pulp fantasy literature, I just don't pretend that it doesn't include a lot of stuff that is ideologically incompatible with liberalism. Many of the writers were through and through 20th century people, living the end of history, excited about how right men like Mussolini were. Others were, of course, early equivalents of beats and hippies, envisioning excuses and fantasies that cast people into liberating situations that allowed their heroes to cast aside traditional societal limitations - often in the name of cheap titillation, but as often in positive light.)<br/><br/>Also, comedy, definitely - the entire notion of killing orc babies is cast in an entirely different light if you have a wry undertone to it, brimming with irony. Vance can be read in this light - awful protagonists, but they're protagonists in a satire, so it's OK. This is what I meant by moral context of actions earlier in the thread; as long as the group doesn't miscommunicate about the meaning of actions, all sorts of things can be done. I see this constantly in our own campaign: players can be quite cruel to NPCs, but it's OK because we grin at each other and laugh at how horrible people our characters are. It would be an entirely different case if a player tried to justify killing orc babies by claiming that it's seriously a good deed.<br/><br/>Tolkien, I'm pretty sure, would find killing orc babies to be abhorrent. As the well-known quote attests, everybody has their role to play on this stage, and it would be the height of folly for us to set ourselves as the judges of our fellow men. Admittedly Tolkien's orcs were tainted by evil, but so was Gollum. Furthermore, orcs are at their base elven-kin - in my Middle-Earth individual orcs are redeemable, and so would the entire race presumably be were their conditions of life different. The same goes for Sauron, anything else would be un-Christian.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359052/#Comment_359052" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T10:01:43+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 10:01AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 10:09AM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Eero<br/>\n<br/>\nI read that as:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Even though it took me a bizarrely long time and a lot of theory to realize about half of the things that are true about D&amp;D that many people seem to grasp immediately and intuitively, I am sticking to my guns on these things: it can't be played by an all-children group (even though it profitably is and was) and that it can't be used for high fantasy (even though it profitably is and was) and I also have some very strong ideas about what Edwardian/postEdwardian playstyles it does or doesn't support."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359055/#Comment_359055" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T10:49:18+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 10:49AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak, some people prefer to play <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> without implied genocide.

I think it's perfectly viable to play that way, and it's the way I play in our current D&amp;D campaign; if the players want to establish their characters as bleeding-heart heroes who go above and beyond the call of duty in taking care of orphan orc babies, then they need to accept that it's going to take some time and attention and maybe other resources away from other things. However, there being a functional way to handle an affair does not imply that there aren't dysfunctional ways. Zak has been establishing a pretty clear stance on the matter, namely that those who might have trouble with this are either idiots or sad fools who shouldn't have tried to play D&amp;D in the first place, but there are other possible discussions to be had - and those are the discussions other people have been having, such as figuring out why orc babies are difficult for them, or how a game text might avoid similar problems, or what a GM who suspects that his group will have trouble should prepare for the situation. Surely these are topics that may be allowed as well? If not for true hobbyists, then for stupid storygamers at least?<br/><br/>In fact, looking at this discussion in general terms, James's and Zak's exchange up in 122-123 seems emblematic of how we continue talking past each other. For some reason every observation of "sometimes there is a problem" is countered by "I don't have a problem and therefore your problem is invalid". This is not such a constructive exchange, is it? I don't know off-hand how to fix it, though; maybe we should just acknowledge clearly and unambiguously that yes, <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i> is a classic of the form and yes, clearly many people play it with no trouble whatsoever. Any discussion about its flaws or problems is therefore necessarily predicated on a group and goals of of play that are somehow contrary to how the module is best utilized.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359072/#Comment_359072" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T12:18:19+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 12:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 12:21PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The module is _completely_ capable of encompassing all the moral dilemmas introduced here, it's just you have to accept (scary scary) that you have to actually DM the way the game assumes you will-- and instructs you to-- DM. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis simply goes back to:<br/>\n"I want to do noncombat things in D&amp;D but I am not good at them, I need a different game"<br/>\nvs<br/>\n"I want to do noncombat things in D&amp;D but D&amp;D is not good at them, I need a different game"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359075/#Comment_359075" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T12:25:28+00:00" title="February 12, 2012 12:25PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously, and in all good faith here, if you can't handle it without a net, couldn't you just either remove the orc babies or roll it with Burning Wheel?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359079/#Comment_359079" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T13:06:22+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  1:06PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you'll look at the first post of the thread, Zak, you'll see that what you ask is also Chris's original topic: should these orc babies be removed when running the adventure with Dungeon World (it's an in-development variant of Vincent Baker's Apocalypse World, using its rules system in a D&amp;D fantasy context), or are they actually useful and fun part of the exercise? Saying that one should remove them if the GM thinks he can't handle them is fair and sensible advice, and along the lines of the flow of discussion here: we're picking at the topic and comparing our experiences and reactions in the hopes that the participants in the discussion can learn something, and Chris maybe gets some insights that help him decide what he's going to do with the module.<br/><br/>Is it possible that you're interpreting the discussion as an attack on <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i>, Zak?

That doesn't seem <i>actually</i> useful to anybody in a forum context, unless you supplement it by telling a bit more about how people could grow to be such powerful gamemasters themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Heikki%20Hallamaa" title="Heikki Hallamaa"><img alt="Heikki Hallamaa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Heikki%20Hallamaa">Heikki Hallamaa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359082/#Comment_359082" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T13:14:55+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  1:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>My approach is not as straightforward:<br/>\n"I want to do noncombat things in D&amp;D but I am not good at them, I need to learn to do them better."</p>\n<p>As I've set out to study and learn a new skill, this sort of deconstructing the game and explaining all the moving bits, that Eero and some others do, is infinitely useful to me.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359085/#Comment_359085" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T13:22:01+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  1:22PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 1:23PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Saying that one should remove them if the GM thinks he can't handle them is fair and sensible advice...</blockquote>\nAgreed! I don't think this situation is as much a challenge for the players so much as it is for the DM. I think other folks have already made this point, but I want to highlight the process that's going on: <br/>- since the players COULD kill the kids, the DM can't count on them choosing to bring the kids along instead - the session can't ride on that assumption.<br/>- thus, since the players might decide to pause the crawl to take care of the kids, the DM has to either create related content (detail the local town more, for instance) or at least be up for a little improvising.<br/><br/>So if they do kill them, are there any external repercussions? That's the other challenge, imo: making sure that the players' choices will matter in the game, not just to each other. <br/>They could matter via: <br/>- gotcha method: an important NPC can sense the souls of dead orc-tots haunting the PCs and refuses to help them. This could be perceived as unfair, potentially. <br/>- escalation method: a few hunters or scouts for the tribe were away when you slaughtered their young. Now they're hunting you through the dungeon! Which is a new challenge, but hard to perceive as dickish (since it seems like a reasonable or predictable outcome).<br/><br/>I think that situations like this one can be a lot of fun, provided you can make room for a few possible outcomes in your prep. If you put forth this scenario in DW, you might have a really easy time of it because DW makes the fictional weight of non-combat tactics easier to gauge for some. On the other hand, if the mostly-freeform social interaction style of B2 is more your style, then you'll be fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359086/#Comment_359086" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T13:50:04+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  1:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 1:50PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @eero<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at MY first post, you'll see I have no problem with the question asked by the OP.

But that doesn't mean the parallels aren't there.  You're rolling along to get rich by exterminating an incorrigibly evil, subhuman race of ugly, lazy, fecund, stupid-yet-cunning savages whose culture has produced little of value, and who can seemingly be slaughtered without so much as a second thought because it's necessary for the survival of your race.

I was ready to roll with whatever the players did, but about half the group was new to RPing and they weren't expecting something like that in the game, probably because of cultural expectations, and the other half just didn't expect it in D&amp;D (we all started with 3e).  I don't know of any video-games they could've played that would've presented them with a similar situation, and to them D&amp;D as a pop-culture thing is more akin to high-fantasy or FF.  I also don't know many folks my age who read classic pulp fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...the players weren't drawing any real-world parallels in our case, they were just unsure of what to do with helpless creatures in the fiction, so we just had to talk it out for a few minutes.  Couldn't the curtains just be blue in this instance, without having to signify the protagonist's depression?

It doesn't have the same role a module does?  It's inherently less provocative to give someone a camera than it is to give someone a picture of someone flipping off their mom?

("What do we do with these monstrous noncombatants?", "Do we kill unconscious foes?", "Do we torture the prisoners for vital information?", etc.) I also don't mind a little bit of character argument about these issues, even if it escalates to inter-party conflict.<br/><br/>What I do mind is when an in-game moral conundrum sparks an argument between players that goes on for half an hour or more. (Half an hour if you're <i>lucky</i>.) Best case scenario, everyone realizes that they were in agreement all along, or can come to a compromise; you've wasted 30 minutes on the pointless argument, but the game lurches on. Worst case scenario, it turns out that one or more of the players has wildly different expectations about the game than the rest of the group does, and each side thinks their side is the "correct" one. ("Heroic" vs. "Gritty", say.) The worst of the worst case scenarios is when you end up with players actually mad at one another.<br/><br/>So I say, keep the noncombatants in the module, but keep a close eye on the players' reactions. Be prepared to step in and forestall arguments before they get to the "waste of time" stage.<br/><br/>For one thing, you can fast-forward through the conversation. Step in and say, "After many minutes of your characters' shouting at one another, you realize that the other person isn't going to budge. Do you find a compromise, or does it come to blows?" If it seems like it's a player-expectation problem rather than an in-game roleplaying problem, be prepared to lead a (short) impromptu discussion about those expectations.<br/><br/>Personally, as a player, I want to know two things about how monsters work in the game. First, are monsters in the game truly monstrous (no free will; always act according to their natures), or are they effectively people with a different culture? (Or are they something in-between?) Second, I want to know what sort of tone we're aiming for. If we're going for a heroic tone, then we don't kill or hurt helpless creatures (unless it's some extraordinary circumstance). If we're going for a gritty, kill-or-be-killed tone, then maybe "show no mercy" is the right approach (although in that case, I'd prefer to fade to black). I'd prefer to know these things <i>before</i> getting to the actual moral conundrum, but the important thing is for the discussion to happen before the 30 minute time sink.<br/><br/>  -Pjack                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dr_pete" title="dr_pete"><img alt="dr_pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dr_pete">dr_pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359213/#Comment_359213" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T04:52:06+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  4:52AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the whole d&amp;d and race discussion was cool, but like various other deconstruction efforts, it can be hard to unsee.

If you do, and want a little less moral ambiguity, have the women be roasting a corpse while the children torment a prisoner or something... they are little evil monsters, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359215/#Comment_359215" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T05:21:10+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  5:21AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2012 8:32AM by jenskot.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Story Games" is not one person, holding one opinion. <br/><br/>There are definitely patterns and trends on Story Games but as a community we represent a lot of different opinions, play styles, and people from a wide array of backgrounds. <br/><br/>In the past people have been surprised when "Story Games" likes D&amp;D 4E, Vampire, OD&amp;D, GURPS, or games that don't deal with moral quandaries. It may be surprising, but it's also refreshing (and not hypocritical).<br/><br/>If "Story Games" seems to have contradictory opinions in this 170 post thread... that's great! <b>It would be weird if it didn't.</b><br/><br/>There are also some people here who don't have a problem with Orc babies or B2, and some that do. A lot of my quotes about Orc babies were from people I played with who have never been to Story Games and some who don't even know it exists. Some were D&amp;D 4E players, some from the OSR, some who mainly play WoD games. Just because I posted about some of these opinions on Story Games doesn't make them my opinions or "Story Games'" opinions. <br/><br/>"Story Games" is not one person, holding one opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359218/#Comment_359218" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T05:55:12+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  5:55AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2012 6:36AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pjack</cite>Personally, as a player, I want to know two things about how monsters work in the game. First, are monsters in the game truly monstrous (no free will; always act according to their natures), or are they effectively people with a different culture? (Or are they something in-between?) Second, I want to know what sort of tone we're aiming for. If we're going for a heroic tone, then we don't kill or hurt helpless creatures (unless it's some extraordinary circumstance). If we're going for a gritty, kill-or-be-killed tone, then maybe "show no mercy" is the right approach (although in that case, I'd prefer to fade to black). I'd prefer to know these things <i>before</i> getting to the actual moral conundrum, but the important thing is for the discussion to happen before the 30 minute time sink.</blockquote>\nI agree on both counts.  Setting expectations early on, and being consistent about delivering on those expectations, is almost a cure-all for this sort of dilemma.<br/><br/>A lot of AD&amp;D modules contained phrases like "the monsters will attack immediately" or "they will fight to the death," and had introductions that basically set up a simple 'if the party does not stop this threat, terrible things will happen' story.  For that matter, a lot of AD&amp;D play involved the party being immediately attacked by orcs or kobolds or hobgoblins or motherfucking <i>wild animals</i>, out of the blue, with no explanations and no quarter given.  If I had a dollar for every time back in the '80s that I heard a DM announce that we'd just spotted humanoids and now we needed to roll initiative because they were attacking us, I would have been able to give up my after-school job and retire to a nice island in the Caribbean.<br/><br/>And there's nothing wrong with any of that.  Okay, everything that isn't specifically marked as Good in the Monster Manual is always out to kill us, that's cool.  More XP and loot for us!  Save the talking for towns and cities, out here the bad guys will attack immediately and they will fight to the death!  That's how every encounter is going to be, and there's nothing to feel bad about there -- if they win initiative, they're going to try and kill us, so we've got no reason not to try and kill them when WE win initiative.  We've established that this is how this game world works, and we can roll with it.<br/><br/>A module that gets its wires crossed and throws in a helpless orc baby room is a problem in that kind of game world.  It can't suddenly pretend that what it really meant was "the monsters are misunderstood and really don't want to attack anyone, ever" or "they will negotiate peacefully and raise their children well," or that the premise of the adventure was 'if the party does not mess with anyone, everything will be hunky-dory' when that is the exact opposite of the message sent by damn near everything else in the game that the DM was running, not to mention other modules in the same series, not to mention other rooms in the same module.  If this is a campaign where the PCs are nearly always told that they must roll initiative and begin combat upon entering a room in a dungeon or cave, it's hard not to see the orc baby dilemma as an outright screwjob.  It's jarringly inconsistent with what's already been established.  (Not necessarily the fault of the module's author, because obviously they'd have no way of knowing what was established in your game.  Although it <i>is</i> hard to shake the image of Gygax throwing in a jarringly inconsistent room and then bein' all "U MAD?" about it.)<br/><br/>Now, if it was dropped into a campaign where it was already established that orc tribes are open to negotiation, where encounters in the wilderness or in any random dungeon or cave didn't start with "The monsters attack!", where the orcs loved their children and were just like us (only greener) and are just looking out for their welfare, then by all means, bring on the room of helpless orc babies, that is totally in line with how that game world works.  Dealing with questions about what to do with the innocent(?) offspring of bloodthirsty raiders is awesome.  Nothing's wrong with moral conundrums in a setting where they are presented fairly and consistently.  It only sucks when 95% of the game is one way, and suddenly room 6 is acting like it's the OTHER way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359249/#Comment_359249" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T07:55:59+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  7:55AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>"Story Games" is not one person, holding one opinion.</blockquote>\nJenskot, please report to the Fun Is Fun Room for brain-scrubbing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359254/#Comment_359254" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T08:29:10+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  8:29AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_359345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359345/#Comment_359345" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T12:04:04+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 12:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>"Story Games" is not one person, holding one opinion.</blockquote>If you persist in insisting on this split personality being true, we must take measures to secure your mental recovery!

I think it's perfectly viable to play that way, and it's the way I play in our current D&amp;D; campaign; if the players want to establish their characters as bleeding-heart heroes who go above and beyond the call of duty in taking care of orphan orc babies, then they need to accept that it's going to take some time and attention and maybe other resources away from other things. However, there being a functional way to handle an affair does not imply that there aren't dysfunctional ways. Zak has been establishing a pretty clear stance on the matter, namely that those who might have trouble with this are either idiots or sad fools who shouldn't have tried to play D&amp;D; in the first place, but there are other possible discussions to be had - and those are the discussions other people have been having, such as figuring out why orc babies are difficult for them, or how a game text might avoid similar problems, or what a GM who suspects that his group will have trouble should prepare for the situation. Surely these are topics that may be allowed as well? If not for true hobbyists, then for stupid storygamers at least?</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEero - sorry to take a while to get back to you. Anyway:<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously there are "dysfunctional ways" to handle any given thing that comes up in D&amp;D.; This isn't an issue of "stupid storygamers" vs. "true hobbyists." Obviously most of you are familiar to some degree with D&amp;D;* but as Zak said many people do seem to understand D&amp;D; mostly as it is caricatured on forums, etc., or from some idea of what D&amp;D; theoretically would to be since it is a game with warriors and monsters and treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean. the play of D&amp;D; is basically of the form:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Player : You are in an imaginary system. Pretend that this situation is real. Say what you try to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. DM : Explain what happens, doing your best to judge a plausible result based on what the player has tried to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Repeat as desired<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially that is the entire game of D&amp;D.; really all other rules are just convenient shortcuts to ease resolving of some tasks that precedent has shown to come up often, or to make it easier for the DM to develop the imaginary situation**. so, skeletal but radically open-ended in terms of possibilities of where the play will go. This is an advantage, but takes practice and judgent and skills in working with people to customize to the individual group. this is something Gygax goes out of his way to try to advise novices concerning in B2 (and moldvay in the basic rules with which it was packaged); how effective or accessible to a target audience the presentation of the advice is is debatable but the general thrust of it, "it's a big task to present an entire fantasy setting where the players can do whatever, and make it a good time" is true and repeated over and over. i understand that some people, especially who are interested in diamond sharp creative fulfillment, are going to have expectation clash when the basic nature of D&amp;D; is that as Gygax says,<br/>\n<br/>\n"The play will often go in unexpected directions and the DM will sometimes be required to decide on situations not covered in the rules." The idea is that you play to see what happens and roll with the direction that takes you. If there is a laser focus it is not on the heroic narrative or the gritty amoral treasure getting or anything like that, the laser focus is on "the play will go in unexpected directions." Really it is a "say yes" game but the Yes is not in the Baker sense, it is in an improv sense of "what happens has happened." "I go into the orc cave - yes, there are orc children there. What next" "I don't kill them. Yes - they are there squalling. What next."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not wrong that a given DM might want to customize B2 so as not to include the orclets. That's fine. I'm just saying that D&amp;D; creating a situation contrary to the narrative you wanted for your character is not a mistake, it is just not what D&amp;D; is doing, and that I think B2 and the associated basic rules are fairly honest about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* or, for example, Runequest, which is fundamentally very similar. Or Tunnels and Trolls or what have you.<br/>\n** RQ, T&amp;T;, etc. differ from D&amp;D; mostly in the shortcuts they offer rather than the basic nature of play. B2 is easily playable with RQ or T&amp;T; for example, with just some subsitution of numbers for monsters/NPCs and spells.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359661/#Comment_359661" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T17:14:07+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  5:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically:<br/>\nTrad games are hard to GM.<br/>\nIs it their fault or did they warn you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15791/helpless-orc-children/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15791/helpless-orc-children">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15791/helpless-orc-children/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15791/helpless-orc-children/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15791/helpless-orc-children/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15791%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15791%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
