It combines all kinds of things that I love:  swashbuckling rogues, the idea of adventurers as being the fantasy-world equivalent of celebrity rock stars, potential Rashomon goodness, and fun banter.<br><br>2. <i>Evil characters realize they are the "bad guys" and turn on their own!</i>-  Always a classic, always fun.<br><br>3. <i>PCs just out of prison, looking for redemption.</i>-  A good, open-ended concept with a lot of room for interesting character backstories and relationships.<br><br><br>Bottom 3:<br><br>-1. <i>A family of grief stricken, rage-full dwarves on a quest to regain their honor.</i>-  Don't care about dwarves, don't care about their honor.  Just doesn't appeal to me.<br><br>-2. <i>Gunslinger Paladins returning home to lay judgment, find peace, and confront childhood rivals.</i>-  Care even less about paladins, care even less about them resolving their childhood issues.<br><br>-3. <i>Saruman's fighting Uruk-hai hunt for man flesh but what happens when your commander gets his hand on the one ring and all out orc civil war breaks out?</i>-  Even if I wanted to play in a Middle Earth game (and I really don't), I would never want to play it using D&amp;D.  I actually don't think the concept is terrible -- take away the Tolkien part and just leave the bones of this story, and it's a good one -- but with the One Ring and the Uruk-Hai, it's a total non-starter for me.<br><br><br>(And the middle three are okay, I could get interested in them depending on how they were pitched.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Richie" title="Richie"><img alt="Richie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Richie">Richie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322481/#Comment_322481" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T01:43:54+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  1:43AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>- Evil characters realize they are the "bad guys" and turn on their own! </i><br><br><b><img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/>&lt;/b&gt;<br><i><br>- A group of monsters hoping to becoming adventurers aren't accepted into the prestigious school of adventure excellency due to racism\u2026 now it's time to show them why they call you monsters!</br></i><br><br><b><img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/>&lt;/b&gt;<br><br><i>- Heroes who take the powers of the monsters they defeat by consuming their flesh... but can you defeat a dragon?</i><br><br><b><img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;<br><br>I didn't really care for the rest but these are gold.

I like this one better than "Evil characters realize they are the "bad guys" and turn on their own!" because in the first case, the adventurers are not necessarily evil. And in in the second case, the trigger is pretty unclear : how and why did they realize they were the bad guys.<br/><br/>- Adventurers just sent to prison, fighting to survive! : I like it as a social commentary on the carceral system. Part of me would like to change "adventurers" to simply "convicts" and set it to modern times. But I could also see it as the way the game above would start. It could even be part of character generation! We see why the character was sent to prison, and how he fared, and then we play through the release and his rehabilitation into society (or redemption).<br/><br/>- Gunslinger Paladins returning home to lay judgment, find peace, and confront childhood rivals! : I like this one, it focuses on the end of the Hero's Journey, the return home. You find out if you were right to leave, how much you've changed and others have changed, resolve any regrets. It's very interesting. Also, I'm a fan of Dogs in the Vineyard, so this is a no-brainer.<br/><br/><br/>- Heroes who take the powers of the monsters they defeat by consuming their flesh... but can you defeat a dragon? - I'm a vegetarian, for one thing. And this takes it a bit far : kill sentient beings to steal their strength is really not appropriate behavior. Of course, I recall the Lunars in Exalted do pretty much that, and I used to think it was neat. I don't know. Plus, it seems the big conflict is going to be : can we defeat a dragon. It doesn't grab my interest that much.<br/><br/>- Monsters hoping to becoming adventurers aren't accepted into the prestigious school of adventure excellency due to racism\u2026 now it's time to show them why they call you monsters! : ...yeah, that's pretty much the opposite response to racism I'd like to play. Rather that showing why they call me a monster, I'd like to show them who the real monsters are. I've had a dream!<br/><br/>- Swashbuckling Rogues competing to tell the best war story over copious amounts of alcohol... play out these epic battles in flashback as each character tells their story! : Not bad. In fact, I first put this in my top 3. Then I though, this is just like Baron Munchaussen, but more limited. Or maybe I'm not seeing it's potential. Three Musketeers is awesome, but far less over-the-top than many other works of literature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322508/#Comment_322508" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T10:02:31+00:00" title="May  1, 2011 10:02AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            YES<br/>- Evil characters realize that they are the "bad guys" after being asked to cross too many lines and turn on their own army!

Same thing: a game that lets you bash heads and break skulls, with some sweet interludes of "why are we doing all this stuff? what for?" followed by more skull-smashing.<br/><br/>* Adventurers sentenced to prison filled with former rivals. Again, this one carries the implicit promise for action that can be provoking and well-grounded in the fiction.<br/><br/>Bottom three:<br/>* Heroes who take the powers of the monsters they defeat by consuming their flesh. This sounds like kind of a Pok\xe9mon / Final Fantasy plot which revolves around gathering stuff  so you can gather more powerful stuff.

I know, from that sentence, exactly what kind of character I want to play, what I'm going to be driving for in play, and the promise of themes that I really enjoy at the table (family, honor, grief, revenge). I assume that the GM/facilitator is going to be driving for those things, and I'm excited to see what happens at the table!\n<blockquote>- Heroes who take the powers of the monsters they defeat by consuming their flesh... but can you defeat a dragon in time to use its power against an even bigger threat?</blockquote>\nSounds fun in an Agon-y way. Even if the GM/facilitator lames out and the whole session is a series of set-piece battles, it sounds like I'll be able to enjoy the (assumed) system behind this consuming/powerup idea - and at best, it'll be more complicated than that.\n<blockquote> Adventurers sentenced to prison filled with former rivals.</blockquote>\nDistant third. Could be great (jail politicking! pressure cooker of relationships and stabbing!), could be lame (you fight "old rivals" who you don't have any investment in b/c it's a one-shot). Knowing the system would tip me one way or the other. If it's PTA, I'm in. If it's D&amp;D 4th, I'd probably pass. If you hadn't asked for a third, I wouldn't have it in the list.\n<blockquote>2. Which of the following are your bottom 3?<br/><br/>- Swashbuckling Rogues competing to tell the best war story over copious amounts of alcohol... play out these epic battles in flashback as each character tells their story.</blockquote>\nSounds like Baron Munchausen, which I enjoy as an icebreaker to play with people I haven't met before, but I can't imagine playing for four hours. Or like it's all about describing things better than other people, which is exhausting and lame (Wushu, I'm looking at you). \n<blockquote>- Gunslinger Paladins returning home to lay judgment, find peace, and confront childhood rivals.</blockquote>\nMaybe a weird brain thing with me, but I just think "Dogs in the Vineyard, eh? I'd rather play something else at a convention". Which is wierd, because I always think that, despite never actually having played DitV at a convention. But then, if it was another system, I would say "Sounds like Dogs, and I bet Dogs would do it better." Unless it's InSpectres. I would sign up if it were InSpectres.\n<blockquote>- Evil characters realize that they are the "bad guys" after being asked to cross too many lines as their army prepares for an attack that will determine who wins the war.</blockquote>\nSounds like a proscribed moral arc that's about themes I'm not interested in (what's the nature of evil, is goodness found in your past deeds or your future ones, etc). That said, again if it was a particular system (Polaris comes to mind), that could swing it for me. This is also included b/c you asked for a third. <br/><br/>So, overall, I only found 4 of the things you presented particularly compelling or offputting, I guess.<br/><br/>(I want to play the dwarf one.

"Grief stricken" isn't my favorite thing to roleplay, but it ain't a deal-breaker.  Somewhat depends on the world and what it means to be a dwarf; I don't like ludicrous, gimmicky characters.<br/><br/><b>2:</b> <i>Swashbuckling Rogues competing to tell the best war story over copious amounts of alcohol... play out these epic battles in flashback as each character tells their story.</i><br/><br/>Instantly appealing.  Instantly worrying too, that I'll have nothing to do while others tell their stories.  Need to know the game structure!  Failing that, I'd probably say, "Still better odds than most of the other options."<br/><br/><b>Every other option depends on factors not listed.  Within those, my least favorite color is:</b><br/><br/><b>1.</b> <i>Gunslinger Paladins returning home to lay judgment, find peace, and confront childhood rivals.</i><br/><br/>Been there, done that.  For one-shots, I like novelty and experimentation.<br/><br/><b>2.</b> <i>Orcs on the hunt for man flesh but when your commander finds the ancient ring that infects those nearby with greed and paranoia...  all out orc civil war threatens to break out.</i><br/><br/>Uh.  So what do I do?  Can I try to become the new orc king?  If not, I'm not really interested... using orc characters to play diplomacy  = too much cognitive dissonance.<br/><br/><b>3.</b> <i>Adventurers just out of prison, looking for redemption.</i><br/><br/>Too open-ended.  Don't wanna spend the 4 hrs dicking around.<br/><br/><b>The rest <i>could</i> be cool, but hard to tell.  My reactions:</b><br/><br/><i>- Evil characters realize that they are the "bad guys" after being asked to cross too many lines as their army prepares for an attack that will determine who wins the war.</i><br/><br/>Um.  So... What are we doing with our 4 hours?  Deciding whether to betray our side or not?  If so, say that.  I like the idea, but worry about how it'd be executed, so I'd want to look at mechanics.  Failing that, "Sounds risky.  Pass."<br/><br/><i>- Heroes who take the powers of the monsters they defeat by consuming their flesh... but can you defeat a dragon in time to use its power against an even bigger threat?</i><br/><br/>Like the color, like the concrete mission...  But I have no idea what choices I'll get to make.  What does "can you defeat the dragon" depend on?  If this is a Gamist game, I tend not to like those.<br/><br/><i>- Monsters who need to become adventurers are kicked out of the prestigious school of adventure excellency due to outright racism\u2026 what do you do?</i><br/><br/>Kinda like the orc civil war: an unfinished premise, which I have an idea how to finish, but I need to know if the game will let me.  If I can make this game be about crafting and executing a deceitful plot to destroy the school, sweet, I'm in.  But I worry that it won't, so I'd pass.<br/><br/><i>- Adventurers sentenced to prison filled with former rivals.</i><br/><br/>Not sure what my options are.  "You can only escape if you work together" would do it for me.

During those 45 minutes, players use Choose Your Own Adventure style handouts to customize their characters. At the end of the game, players anonymously use score cards to rate the GM's performance!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't your mom's D&amp;D; 3E! Hacks include simple momentum, belief, and stunt mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Expanded description:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the dwarves were numerous, dwelling in immense vaulted fortresses among the mountain peaks. The dwarves of old delved deep into the earth in search of gold, gems, and mithral ore. For long years they prospered as their coffers overflowed, but their prosperity would not go unnoticed!<br/>\n<br/>\nEndless hordes of dragons, giants, goblins, and orcs crashed against the dwarven fortresses. But the stout dwarves refused to yield! Their mighty armor turned aside arrow and blade while their hammers and axes sent thousands of enemies to their graves. Yet one by one, the great dwarven citadels fell.<br/>\n<br/>\nLegendary dwarven pride kept them from seeking aid. But you were the last dwarven kingdom to fall and the first to ask for help. And help the Elves gave! Together you crushed the monstrous hordes! But in the final moments\u2026 the Elves take from you what they swore to protect! After months of banishment\u2026 now it is time to take your home back!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326054/#Comment_326054" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T02:50:45+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  2:50AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2011 2:55AM by elkin.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

Papa McCallahan is dead, killed by the Dwellers of the Deep who tunneled into our family keep from below, defiled the statues of our ancestors and killed our dear father. We have been driven out of our hearth and home, but we still have our family, and we are still proud dwarves. The McCallahan clan will never give up. We will smash our enemies and drive them back into the filthy chasms from which they crawled. We will have our vengeance. We will have our home".<br><br>Introducing:<br>* <b>Mama McCallahan</b>, priestess of the Rock Goddess, a highly-traditional matriarch whose first priority is to keep the family together. She does not consider the smooth-faced Leah to be a part of the family.<br>* <b>Peter Greenleaf-McCallahn</b>, her eldest, the prodigal son who left the keep years ago to study sorcery at the elven academies of the north. He considers himself a dwarf of the world, and views his family as narrow-minded bigots. He returned only after the dreadful invasion of the Dwellers. He did not get a chance to confront his father, or to introduce him to his elven bride.<br>* <b>Leah Greenleaf-McCallahn</b>, his elven wife, a ranger from the northern woods who was disavowed by her family and her people for marrying a dwarf, and is now shunned and ostracized by his family as well.<br>* <b>Arthur McCallahan</b>, her brother-in-law, attempts to be a tough axe-wielding warrior like his father before him. He could never stand up to his father, and he does not forgive himself for not aiding him in that fateful combat. He also does not forgive his brother Peter who was not there to help when the Dwellers attacked.<br>* <b>Gretta McCallahan</b>, his wife, an emotional berzerker of the Parnell clan, who is said to be in cahoots with the Dwellers of the Deep. She truly loves her husband and adores her mother-in-law, and finds it unfair that Peter will take her husband's place as the head of the McCallahan clan. When she discovers the Parnells have taken over parts of the keep, she will have to choose between her loyalty to her old family and her love for her new family.<br><br>Cameo appearance by:<br>The restless ghost of <b>Papa McCallahan</b>, the head of the McCallahan clan whose iron grip kept the family together through harsh times, who believed in family and honor above all, and who could never learn to love his two sons equally.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326058/#Comment_326058" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T03:42:42+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  3:42AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ditto Bill White.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326080/#Comment_326080" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T06:52:10+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  6:52AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: elkin</cite>Cool!

Really you could say you are shoehorned into being a patriot dwarf for my first choice, but I think the clear aim is nice. And there isn\u2019t much mention of good or evil.  <br/><br/>The swashbuckler one just seems like it could lead to a good time with people embellishing their various tales and such. Again it has a clear objective.<br/><br/>The Prison One has a less clear objective, but it\u2019s pretty implicit. I doubt you want to stick around. Plus I think it has a pretty fun premise that the GM could mess with. Is there a femme fatale type in there? A utter psycho? Affable evil type? Someone you framed? Again your character isn\u2019t defined.<br/><br/><br/>My bottom three.. The heroes who consume the flesh of monsters seems a bit too hardcore for my tastes and a bit too specific. And the goal is too specific for my tastes. The dwarves just want their home back. These guys have to defeat the dragon in order to beat a bigger threat. So that is a lot that has to be established. On top of the quasi- cannibalism. <br/><br/>The second one has a bit of that shoehorned quality, I don\u2019t think it has to be bad. It really depends on how it is presented. But knowing what kind of character I\u2019m going to be and that specific (childhood rival and such) is not that appealing.<br/><br/>The last choice I put down reluctantly because it could be interesting depending on the setting and such, but I put there because you needed a third choice. And I slightly admire your Evil Generals doing a  Heel Face Turn and the Orcs facing corruption. I\u2019m kind of a sucker for anti-villains.  Which may seem odd after I kind of dismissed the monster eaters\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327449/#Comment_327449" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T22:46:40+00:00" title="June  1, 2011 10:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TOP<br/>- Evil characters realize that they are the "bad guys" after being asked to cross too many lines as their army prepares for an attack that will determine who wins the war.<br/><i>This would be the most interesting if you rewound it to before they were asked to cross too many lines.</i><br/><br/>- Heroes who take the powers of the monsters they defeat by consuming their flesh... but can you defeat a dragon in time to use its power against an even bigger threat?<br/><i>Nethack the roleplaying game!!!!</i><br/><br/>- Gunslinger Paladins returning home to lay judgment, find peace, and confront childhood rivals.<br/><i>Not really loving it, but seems best of a bad bunch.</i><br/><br/><br/>bottom:<br/>- Swashbuckling Rogues competing to tell the best war story over copious amounts of alcohol... play out these epic battles in flashback as each character tells their story.<br/><i>dont like the play structure</i><br/><br/>- Adventurers sentenced to prison filled with former rivals.<br/><i>too one dimensional</i><br/><br/>- A family of grief stricken, rage-full dwarves on a quest to take back their home.<br/><i>too one dimensional</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
