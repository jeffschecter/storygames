I started typing a reply there, but soon realized it was far too long for that thread, and was derailing in itself. So I'm making a new thread, if anyone wants to talk about this (from any perspective: marketing, economy, D&amp;D editions, whatever).<br/><br/>Here's my original reply:<br/>[Pathfinder and 4E tied sales 1]<br/>Red Box might be outselling Pathfinder on Amazon (for obvious reasons), but Paizo is supposedly coming out with their own "essentials" line. Even if they won't have the nostalgia credit for marketing, I'm guessing it will do well in some circles. I'm really interested how it will turn out.<br/><br/>A few other thoughs:<br/>-it would be very interesting to see the figures for various OSR clones, LotFP sold like hotcakes (although its print run cannot be compared to behemoths like Paizo or WotC), and there is Labyrinth Lord, OSRIC, Swords &amp; Wizardry, Basic Fantasy (plus all the faux supplements (like Carcosa) and the modules...I'm really curious what their figures would look like if put together. I think there are actually three parallel markets for D&amp;D right now.<br/><br/>-I'm really really curious what Pathfinder 2.0 will be like. If you go to RPGnet, there's a bunch of threads with questions like "How much did Pathfinder change from 3.x?" and the common answer seems to be "not enough". My secret wish is that with a new edition (when they come out with it, a few years down the line), they will see the potential of the OSR market and make a sort of hybrid*, further strengthening their "old"D&amp;D position versus the "new"D&amp;D of 4E (even Mearls has been talking about how he wants to take the game back, closer to its roots).<br/><br/>(*which is kinda how I'm running my game now)<br/><br/>-re: modules, just something that crossed my mind. Over on Grognardia, James was complaining how these days "adventure" and "module" seem to be synonymous with "pre-planned plot" (which goes hand-in-hand with the 90's insistence of the GM as storyteller, metaplots, and "roleplaying = collaborative storytelling but NOT story now"), whereas the modules of old were more location based. You had a place with its own people, secrets etc, there was no "plot" to it. The PC wandered into it and whatever happened, happened, if they missed the big bad's secret plan, no biggie. It was just a set piece to interact with and explore (which is much closer to how Story Now deals with "setting", in my eyes - don't plan, play to find out what happens, don't have solutions in mind, just create situations)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296263/#Comment_296263" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T10:20:41+00:00" title="October  8, 2010 10:20AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Believe it or not, Lisa Stevens is my Wednesday night DM.  The only campaign I had to sign an NDA to play (we started when Pathfinder was in alpha), and so I don't know how much I can really participate in the conversation, but I do get the impression that a 2.0 is not even a glimmer in their eyes yet - the whole point of Pathfinder is to keep their baby alive, the baby they created back when they were at Wizards, and most of their customers (on the Paizo boards) don't want change - Lisa never expected it to do so well.  She's over the moon.<br/><br/>On sales figures - game sales (well, anything sales) follow a power curve.  You have a couple of successful heavy hitters and then everything else trails off rapidly.  I'd expect that the plays (I won't say sales because we're including free games) of any given clone is nigh-immaterial compared to Pathfinder, 4e, and people who are still playing 3.5.  Taking the sales of D&amp;D + Pathfinder and doubling it would probably be an overly optimistic estimate if you were trying to guess "How many tabletop D&amp;D-like gamers are out there, anyway?" by my back of the napkin estimates.<br/><br/>Random interesting factoid:  Back when Hasbro bought Wizards one of the sweetest plums was the digital D&amp;D rights - much sweeter than the book rights.  (But nowhere as sweet as Pokemon.)  And then they sold those sweet, sweet digital rights to the company formerly known as Infogrames and everyone looks forward to the day that Wizards will get those rights back.  Well, everyone except the company formerly known as Infogrames.<br/><br/>Not to derail the thread, but the Paizo product I'm most excited about is the "Plot Twist Deck" - we played our last campaign with "whimsy cards" that Lisa's had since her Lion Rampant days (I think), but I didn't start really getting a feel for how to use them to push my own story agenda until I started hanging out on this forum.  I think my new attitude + the cooler cards could create some big awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296266/#Comment_296266" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T10:42:17+00:00" title="October  8, 2010 10:42AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we're going to see a Pathfinder 2.0 for a relatively long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296281/#Comment_296281" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T12:07:06+00:00" title="October  8, 2010 12:07PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I don't think we're going to see a Pathfinder 2.0 for a relatively long time.</blockquote>Agreed.

That gets quoted a lot, especially by strictly traditionalist gamers who don't realise that not every system has the sprawling complexity of D&amp;D. Me, I've always preferred to try new games, although if I don't like a game I tend not to go back to it, and I have to find something interesting in the premise. 'Best Friends', while a good game in its own way, is a game I will never play because I'm just not interested in the idea of an RPG that runs somewhat like 'Sex in the City'.<br/><br/>Hold on, what was the thread about again? Ak, D&amp;D and Pathfinder. I hate them. I can never find groups who are willing to play anything else &gt;_&lt; Still, it's certainly interesting to see that the battle between Grognards faithful to 3rd Ed and Gamers willing to give the new rules a chance (whether they play them as well as buy them being another question) is a somewhat even-sided one.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296515/#Comment_296515" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T13:17:09+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  1:17PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After browsing the intertubes for a bit I found two unofficial statements from Paizo people or people close to Paizo saying something like "We aren't even considering a new edition." and "2nd edition is at least 10 years away", which pretty much confirms that the intention behind Pathfinder is to preserve that edition and continue support for it, and not to do something new.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296517/#Comment_296517" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T13:37:39+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  1:37PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even though I'm not a fan of the Pathfinder system, I'm a fan of Paizo.
