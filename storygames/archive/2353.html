                    I've been without a RP group for a while. Lately, my best opportunities to play have been with my brother, who I get to see every couple of months at best. It's difficult to do the game prep close enough to the session to matter, and things don't happen often enough to get much in the way of developed character bits to help with improvising good story, so I've been thinking of pick-up play, something that can be run on the spur of the moment. The times I've tried, it's always been a "Okay, where is your character, what do you want to do?" kind of moment, and without the campaign prep, it is always off to a rough start.<br/><br/>It's gotten bad enough that I've been feeling drawn to stock D&amp;D 3.5, which I've never played and still have a pretty foul taste in my mouth from 2e (I know it's gotten better, but still can't get behind it). I know that it's not well suited to spur of the moment play (unless you want to spend most of the session in the monster manual), but I was feeling drawn to it.<br/><br/>After spending the weekend pouring over D&amp;D, and thinking about it from a "what's fun, and why would I think it'd be easier with this than something else" point of view, there are a couple of things that I've noticed.<br/><br/>1. d20 isn't really that bad<br/>2. Most of what the d20 system is isn't a Roleplaying Game at all, it's a miniatures game<br/>3. It has a strong 'default adventure' (the dungeon crawl)<br/><br/>Built into D&amp;D is this tactical board game of going into a dungeon, killing the inhabitants and taking their stuff. You don't need any plot or inspiration or twists to do this. Sure, it'll get old, sure it's pretty lame, but if you just want to throw down, you're covered. I think this is why I've been feeling drawn to play it.<br/><br/>So anyway, I've been thinking about taking that idea (having a strong default adventure, and a fun game that plays to that adventure well) as a good kick-off, saftey net.<br/><br/>I know this post is a little random, and I don't know where I'm going with this myself, but I wanted it out there to hear what others think.                </div>

                            I think, in general, you're right. That doesn't mean you can't play it using other styles (see Ron Edwards' forays into thematic play in 3E, for example). Also, Mike Mearls of WotC runs hour-long games at lunchtime at work, but I'm not sure how much nighttime prep goes into that. If you're happy playing low level characters, a GM can run a simple game with very small amounts of prep.                        </div>

                            But once the game gets more complex, the prep goes up fast. What I'm talking about has more to do with what is missing (or perhaps just unspoken) with many other games. With small groups and irregular sessions it's very difficult to get invested in a story at first, so maybe some bashing (or something else) is the way to go. Another example would be in the old Traveller game, where you could spend a lot of time just fiddling around with the speculative trade rules and have fun there without and 'story' to speak of.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just a way to stall until you come up with something grabby enough to be a story.                        </div>

                            After reading Mike Mearls' AP of his WotC lunchtime games, they are even more board gamey miniatures game than D&amp;D 3.5 by the book, specifically because game time is limited. (I don't know how much prep time he spends.)                        </div>

                            Hi Daniel!<br/><br/>I'm reading a bit into your comments and getting this vibe like you're afraid there might maybe be something inherently wrong or worth feeling guilt over in running an unsophisticated dungeon crawl, so let me squash that hang-up for you.<br/><br/>Nothing you've said should really be controversial. As you may have observed, however, there was at some point around the mid-eighties the introduction of a snobbish attitude into many (if not most) game texts (inc. AD&amp;D2) implying or outright stating that the strategic dungeon-crawling, min-maxing gameplay associated with the early days of the hobby was brainless wrongbadfun only suitable for the uncouth (or "munchkins"), and the "right" way to play was "story-driven" gameplay where the GM should contrive to get his players to freely participate in his elaborately-prepped plotline. (All the while failing to address the contradiction inherent in such a task.) This was certainly what I considered to be the "way to roleplay" when I was a teenager, and hey, it certainly worked well enough in those days when I and my friends didn't really have a lot of other commitments for our time.<br/><br/>What I'm basically saying is your instincts and observations on this are pretty solid. The 3.5 revision text, in particular, seems to reflect a conscious attempt to stop trying to be the (impossible) be-all, end-all, one-size-fits-all set of roleplaying rules and focus on supporting a particular style of play.<br/><br/>My own play experience with 3E D&amp;D bears this out. I've sat through a few too many meandering, tedious games that "upgraded" to 3E -- simply extending the same games that were being played with previous editions of AD&amp;D rules, as though the new rules were like a fresh coat of paint that would magically solve the "mysterious" problem of player attrition. Regarding the 3.5 rules as its own game -- one of action-oriented tactical miniatures glued together with a healthy dollop of the other roleplaying stuff -- has proved to be a lot more fun.<br/><br/>And I'm pretty sure the reason for this has to do with simply establishing clear social expectations about "what kind of game we are playing." The guy who was only interested in deep character roleplay won't feel like he's justified in passive-aggressive feet-dragging behavior when he doesn't get enough time in-character time to work out his brooding half-elf issues. The gal who just wants to be entertained by whatever epic tale the GM has worked out this week won't complain for the eight time about having to actually learn the combat rules. Everyone's more on the same page, excited to see if that slick attack combo he worked out will be able to take down your half-fiend ogre mage blackguard. That, or they'll have to pipe up and suggest they'd rather play something different.<br/><br/>Like, no blackjack dealer ever worried <i>Hey, maybe this whole thing is a little too simplistic, maybe everyone would really be happier if I worked something more though-provoking into the game, </i> right? Concerns about "what's fun" without first establishing the social consensus amongst the people who will be participating in the activity are similarly absurd. It's gonna be tough for anyone to offer you advice on what will be fun for you without knowing something about your game's social group.<br/><br/>Everything sounds good. What's keeping you from playing this already? Rounding up people? Hang-up over prep? Who ya planning to play with? Just your bro, or other unmentioned folks? "Experienced gamers" or not?                        </div>

                            joepub - Polarpunk sounds pretty neat, I'd like to know more.<br/><br/>Thanks larry, it's nice to see that I'm not completely off base. I was actually leaning towards the other side, although I like tactical board games, sometimes I want something else, and I'm thinking on incorporating other games. A dungeon crawl is just an example of a common one (which is really well supported in many RPGs). I'm thinking of other 'gamey' bits. There used to be an old Mechwarrior sourcebook called Mercenaries, in it, there was a lot of fluff for the different mercenary units in the Inner Sphere, but there was also this system for essentially working the books for a unit in the game. Ya know, these jobs are available, this is the opposition, these are the costs of operating for that time, this is the payoff. What my group at the time did was bolt this system ontop of Battletech (instead of Mechwarrior) and play it as a management game, along side of the board game. I'm sure we weren't the only ones, but I'm thinking that now, it was really nice to shift gears.<br/>So what I'm really looking towards is gluing other kinds of games onto a RPG (aside from tactical miniatures) to round things out. This is inspired in part by Jason Morningstar's post on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2333&amp;page=1#Item_36" rel="nofollow">Medical Hospital</a>. This idea of collecting several little games, and using the RPG as the glue that holds them all together.<br/><br/>As far as me and playing, my current gaming group is feeling burned out on RPG's and focusing on boardgames right now (the pendulum will swing back eventually), I can't see how play by post would actually work (if anyone can show me a fourm game that was really fun, an example of what there should be more of, I'd like to see it), and most other people I know are strongly in the non-gamer camp (Not inexperienced, but need a hard sell for mainstream games). On an unrelated note, I'm currently prepping for an AFMBE game, inspired by Snakes on a Plane, involving a crewmember on an infested container ship on Z-day. Fun fun.                        </div>

                            To clairfy, my observation is that d20 <b>as written in D&amp;D 3.5</b> is actually two games tied together. A decent RPG, and a decent (though a little fugly at some spots) tabletop tactical miniatures game. I don't think anyone is doubting that it could, and is used as only one of these, or that there's something wrong with d20 as a system. My point is that having multiple modes of play, and being able to pick where on the spectrum your group is going to live, at any time, is one of it's strengths. I'm fishing for other games that could be tacked onto an rpg to add other 'dials'. I think Burning Wheel has a bit of this, where you can use the core resolution mechanic or Fight to resolve combat, and you can use the core resolution mechanic or DoW for negotiations. I really don't want this to be a discussion about d20 at all, I was using it as an example of games that have minigames built in as a 'grease' to get the play going.                        </div>

                            So, Daniel, if you're drawn to the throw-down bits of 3.5E, just play that. If you're worried about the escalation of levels and the increasing amount of DM prep that requires, slow down level advancement. Maybe even stop it. Talk to your players about it and see what will be fun for them. If they're all about leveling, and you're not up to the work effort required to make that happen, then just tell them you can't do it.<br/><br/>Wizards of the Coast handles the prep problem pretty well, though, in the form of published modules. Just pick up a module appropriate for the level of your party, do some minor prep (skim the text and sticky-note your PHB/DMG for any weird rules the module uses), and play it out of the book. Fun!                        </div>

Tangent, with apologies: <br/><br/>I find it's always more useful to specify what d20 game you're talking about, as "d20" covers so many disparate systems and products at this point that any blanket statement about it is bound to be wrong in the context of a specific example.<br/><br/>That said, I think Larry's "action-oriented tactical miniatures glued together with a healthy dollop of the other roleplaying stuff" is as apt  a description of 3.5 as I've ever heard.<br/><br/>Otherwise, what Adam said.                        </div>

                            Daniel,<br/><br/>I'll just say again how much fun, and how easy to run play and prep for Savage Worlds is.  The description of "action-oriented tactical miniatures glued together with a healthy dollop of the other roleplaying stuff" fits very well and it's very easy to prep for even at higher power levels.<br/><br/>Also, the setting materials for it are really well geared towards the busy GM.  I'm talking about the Plot Point campaign books here, like 50 Fathoms and Rippers.  Typically you have 144 pages, 4 are the setting that the players need to know, 40 are extra rules and new powers for the players to use and the other 100 pages are adventures and things to kill.  I've been running 50 Fathoms for a year now and really haven't needed to do any proper work (except build the lego monsters for the players to wail on).  It's a fun system and it's worth looking at if you're worried that d&amp;d is too fiddly.<br/><br/>As for the problem of irregular schedules, I think if you're looking at story focussed game as an option you might want to look at the "small game" type thingies like Mountain Witch or Shab Al-Hiri roach.  Designed (pretty much) to create a single specific type of story in a single session.  That might be worth thinking about, or am I missing the point?                        </div>

                            I have two things to add about D&amp;D3.5:<br/>1. What's been repeated many times here, that D&amp;D may be oriented toward dungeon crawls I think there are products that do it better.  I went through 3/4 of Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil (among other products) and a set of 20-year gaming vets could only manage about 4 to 5 rooms a session.  As a ruleset it tends to be sluggish and bits heavy (and after a while even I find it kinda unmanageable).  I will say that as a system it's head's above older versions mathematically and intiutively - namely roll a d20 and add to get a target number.  I love consistancy <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As an alternative dungeon crawl machine I suggest <b>Descent: Journeys in the Dark</b>.  With a few tweaks I made this FF boardgame into a great dungeon crawl RPG.<br/><br/>2. As mentioned there are more RPG oriented versions of D20 (Mongoose &amp; Green Ronin are about the most successful at this) that remove some of the parts that don't add much and add a level of lethality to the game that some folks (myself included) find hit point systems severely lacking.  I don't really like leveling as a GM.  I like advancement in games (I am a sim player at heart) but I prefer the advancement be akin to actions and characterization.                        </div>

I'd give a shout out to Malhavoc as well, particularly <i>Arcana Evolved</i>. I was actually in an event Mearls ran at GenCon that had a lot more "rolepalying stuff" than the D&amp;D I typically play. I think this is because AE adds some mechanical bits that tie into aspects of the setting (e.g., the emphasis on ceremony), and the dramatic-editing aspects of Hero Points give the players some narrative input. But, it's also 99% D&amp;D, so you can use all of the resources available.                        </div>

                            Adam - Though you're right that D&amp;D does give the throw down and play option, I like the idea of other mechanics to support other types or throw down. I'm just running off the cuff here, but a research/investigation system, where the problem is modeled similarly to an opponent, and the research 'erodes' the problem/to mystery instead of the sword doing damage. I would like to make clear however, I don't have an interest in drifting d&amp;d to something else. I'm just looking to see what sort of 'mini-games' other systems have, and how they help 'grease' play.<br/><br/>Rich - I've found Savage Worlds, and I really dig it. With the plot point settings, it almost hits the nail on the head for the low prep, fun if you just want to throw down, deep enough for good stories when you want that. The irregular schedule (and inconsistent group size) does make things tricky, but with a stable of pregen's that might not be a huge problem. Small games will help, but I don't think that system alone can solve this.                        </div>

                            Daniel, for sure a system alone cannot solve all problems like a magic wand.  I think that from what you say it's an approach to gaming that's needed.  So, if you want a story focussed game with an irregular group, you kinda need to complete the story in one session, so next time it doesn't rely on the same people showing up.  The other thing is to keep prep to a minimum.  I mean, we all have lives outside of gaming don't we?<br/><br/>We've had some good experiences with a handful of games like this which allow for a complete story in one sitting with little or no preparation.  I don't really know if that's what you're looking for though, but it's not system <i>per se</i> so much as the games approach to gaming and how the game text tells you to run the game.<br/><br/>For example, I was at a Con last week and three of us sat down in a 4 hour slot with nothing to do.  After mucking about for about half an hour, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2359" rel="nofollow">Scott decided to run Dogs in the Vineyard</a>.  James and I created characters and we played out an awesome game well within the allotted time.  I think that you could use that story structure for other games, in fact, I did exactly that for a Deadlands game I ran later that Con.  The point is that with the right approach and a system which backs it up, you can have a pretty satisfying story driven game in one session with little or no prep.<br/><br/>But, y'know, throwing down with D&amp;D or Savage Worlds, killing things and taking their stuff is pretty awesome fun too.  My group alternates between the two, we play pretty crunchy combat/action oriented games half the time and much more story focussed stuff half the time.<br/><br/>BTW, I see exactly where you're coming from with the SW Plot Point campaigns.  Wicked cool, but yeah, really designed for an ongoing game with mostly the same players session after session.  Of the ones I've read, 50 Fathoms is probably the one which would work best with sporadic attendance because you can have any number of "spare" characters hanging around on a ship, but even then I think what you're talking about better suits a series of one-offs.                        </div>

<blockquote>joepub - Polarpunk sounds pretty neat, I'd like to know more.</blockquote>
Daniel (or anyone else), whisper me your email and I can send you a playtest copy.<br/><br/>What Polarpunk offers is:<br/>*Quick character generation, based off of Archetypes and Feat selection<br/>*Simple characters: 4 attributes, 2 Thresholds, a Wound total, Feats and Gear.<br/>*Tactical options without a lot of crunch. Combat is simple enough so that I can fit the whole system - all its options and rules - onto a single page flowchart.<br/>*Easy to prep for, and it'll offer a lot of support in the form of pre-generated conflicts and opponents and obstacles<br/>*the possibility for miniatures usage, but not requirement.<br/><br/>The small-version setting pitch is:
<blockquote>Apocalypse hit. Nuclear war decimated our cities, global anarchy broke out, global warming hit its breaking point, and a second ice age washed over the earth. The shattered remains of humankind went underground, setting up fragmented, isolated bunker colonies.<br/><br/>Now, finally, we have re-emerged. Earth is an icy, radiation-clouded wasteland. Polar bears have assumed empire over the earth. Our cities lie in ruins, waiting to be reclaimed. As a forward scout for humanity's re-expansion, it's your job to seek out other bunker colonies, scavenge our past from abandoned cities, and fight off the growing polar bear hordes. You're our first and last hope of ever reclaiming the earth.</blockquote> </div>

                            JDCorley, you're correct. Both would be wildly different games.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is a game that involves miniatures, according to its rulebook. This makes it a miniatures game if the definition OF a minis game is "a game which involves miniatures", but according to other definitions might put it outside the label of "miniatures game".<br/><br/>There's no use debating terms if you're talking about two seperate things.                        </div>

                            Guys, I missed the part where the original poster expressed a sincere interest in an argument about "what D&amp;D is." I simply pointed out to him that the style of gameplay he was thinking about is explicitly supported by the rules text he was considering, so he should totally rock on. Suddenly, people are leaping in the defend the besmirched reputation of D&amp;D, as though I was suggesting the way some particular instance of "D&amp;D" is being played wrong. What gives?*<br/><br/>Hey Daniel,<br/><br/>The really important part of my previous post was the last paragraph, with the questions about who's playing. If you go through a bunch of effort to set up a new game with a focus on dungeon crawling and "throwing down," and it turns out the other people you're playing with aren't really interested in that sort of thing, well, you just found a new way to waste a bunch of prep time, no?<br/><br/>Also, I wanted to mention something about not automatically discounting non-gamers from your considerations, but I gotta run out for a bit. Maybe someone else would elaborate?<br/><br/><br/><br/>* That's a rhetorical question, smartass, so don't even.

                            Larry,<br/>I know what you mean (regarding not setting up a game that delivers what the folks playing aren't buying), and actually that's part of my point. There are a lot of games that deliver tactics with their bowl of RPG, before I started looking at story games, I was a big 'universal system' guy. GURPS, Hero, that sort of thing. Same deal, tactics + roleplaying (please lets not get into an argument about these systems, and whether they are or aren't, they all have simple task resoluton systems, and <b>very</b> complex combat systems. Yes, you can dial those bits way down, and some universal systems really hold your hand in doing it, but then you're left with just the basic mechanic.<br/><br/>Regarding who's playing, I try to play with just about anyone I know, often breaking in new players (which means, often the player's don't really know what they want). I don't really think I'm discounting non-gamers, I'm not pulling strangers off the street either though.<br/><br/>What I really like about narrative games, is it makes it easy for the players to tell the GM what they want the game to be about. The part that's frustrating is when there are people at the table who really have no idea what they want, it's nice to have a structure to hang the game off for the first couple of sessions. There's one guy in our on again, off again group who has a great time, every time we play, but it takes him forever to come up with a character concept. It's like pulling teeth. It would be much easier for him if we were playing something like red box D&amp;D. Much like how The Shadow of Yesterday's keys reward the characters for what the players define as important, is there a way to have a per player dial for 'crunch' (not just the fighty kind)?<br/><br/>Is this insane?                        </div>

                            Man, you said it.  Specifically, that one of the most frustrating things about a narrative game is when the players really don't know what they want out of it and there's no simple-to-understand, easy-to-work-with structure to hang everything off of until they work it out.<br/><br/>Speaking as a guy who tends to come up with character ideas and gaming goals pretty slowly, I know <b>I</b> like having some guiding principles laid down, a nice (and short!) list of options that are guaranteed to be solid, playable, and fun.  Nearly every narrative game I've played in has started out the same way, with a lot of open-ended questions that I probably couldn't answer well even if you gave me a day to think them over.  When push comes to shove, I'd rather try and use someone else's ideas and skip the whole brainstorming part of most narrative games, at least until enough time has passed for my own ideas to actually be ready to serve (and when I'm actually comfortable enough with the setting, the system, and the group to feel like I know which of those ideas work and which ones are likely to be a terrible waste of time).<br/><br/>I'd find trying a new narrative game to be less awkward and unsatisfying if more tools were available to get play started quickly.  Even just a stack of index cards, each with a pre-written concept or trait or whatever on it, passed out randomly, would be a godsend--anything that'll postpone the question "what do you want this game to be about?" until it's possible for me to actually <i>answer</i> that question.  Anything that'll give the group an easy road away from the blank stares and awkward silences and get the game rolling.  It would actually make a narrative game something our group (I'm not the only "slow idea" man here) could use for a pickup game: as it is, we blow through most of our evening just trying to get the game started, and play suffers as a result.  It's not the only problem we run into when we dip our toe into the narrative-gaming pool, but it's certainly one of the larger ones.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>

                            Accounting -- right on. It's actually what got me interested in indie games, this focus on "this game does this, and if this isn't what you want, don't play this game", it's a refreshing change from "here is a system you can buy into, and play whatever you want with it". I'm not sure that the latter really works without a lot of GM time filling in the gap between the rules and the game. When I first looked at Savage Worlds, it seemed nice, and it had some interesting ideas, but it didn't really fit what I needed at all, it was just another system, with attributes, skills, advantages, and disadvantages, sure combat was different, and bennies were great, but nothing that made things well suited for casual play.<br/><br/>Then I looked at Rippers (a plot point setting).<br/><br/>Sure it had the typical stuff I'd expect with setting books, new advantages, skills, some gear, rules. Then they got to adventures. Instead of focusing on structure, the first thing the book does is grab you and say "This is what Rippers do", and gave you six things. They expanded each of those, for how to actually run an adventure that does each of those things. Only after that, they give a broad story arc, and a list of adventure seeds.                        </div>

                            Here's something to consider:<br/><br/>Is it truly so that the people playing (including possibly yourself) are "slow" and uncreative and require prodding and predigested ideas in order to "figure out" what they "really want"? Or is there an unspoken assumption, perhaps inadvertently developed over years of playing more or less the same game,  that the mere act of <b>being creatively assertive</b> is somehow not kosher to the social arrangement, like you'd be stepping on somebody's toes or being the asshole or something?<br/><br/>I certainly don't pretend to know the answer to that for any particular group of players.

                            I don't know.  Maybe, maybe not.  How would one tell the difference?<br/><br/>And more importantly, is there a useful difference between providing "training wheels" to get a pickup narrative game going quickly for players who tend to think up ideas slowly, and providing the same for players who are nervous about being creatively assertive?<br/><br/>If the goal is to be able to do a pickup game that's fun for a whole group of players like the ones I've seen (and/or the one I am), I'm not sure the <i>why</i> behind the initial slowdown/awkwardness matters...at least not in the short run when all you care about is everyone having a good time.

                            While I'm not letting you off the hook to actually contemplate the possibility I've presented, "Accounting" has a good point there, so I'll focus on that, since it seems like the most constructive avenue for discussion at this point.<br/><br/>How do you safely create a space where each participant can decide for himself that it's okay to jump in and really cut loose creatively, that his contribution will in fact be valued as adding to everyone's fun? (Or, conversely, to signal "Thanks, but no thanks, I'd really be happiest if somebody else held the reigns right now.") I'll admit, just egging them on to "be more assertive" is not super useful advice.<br/><br/>I think one of the things to look for is what's often referred to as "flags." I'm not aware of a formal definition for that term as Forge lingo or whatever, but it seems pretty self-explanatory if you've seen it in use. Here are the first two local links I found by minimal effort:

</ul>
Daniel (and AFT), read those over and let me know if that's useful to you. Too "well, duh, I already know that" perhaps?<br/><br/>This is something I haven't tested out to my own satisfaction yet, so I'm eager to understand this better myself.                        </div>

                            I think the key, Larry, is unfortunately a paradigm shift in the expectations of players.  You have to go from "show up and experience the GM's story" or "show up and experience this emulation of cool thing X" and move into "show up and develop, together and in real time, the progress of a story the results of which no one knows ahead of time."  Until you accept that anything can happen and the story will not be living up to some external criterion, individual player contributions will always be accepted or rejected on the basis of that criterion (ie, the GM's story, or "how the World of Darkness is supposed to work").  You have to come to the table saying, "I'm going to play this game with these creative people and together we're going to make something new."  (Admittedly, it may not really be that new, but preconceived notions will screw things up.)<br/><br/>How to create the paradigm shift?  For my money, the best method is short-run games with little to no prep or build-up.  When there's no opportunity to preconceive, there are fewer preconceptions. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            I see what y'all are saying about the social expectation change and it's ringing true (how did we miss the social contract all those years, were we stupid, I ask myself?) but I would put it in more positive terms. If you're friends getting together to hang out and throw some dice and drink some beer, you may have deep matters-of-taste differences, as in 'jesus, everything that my friend says when he makes up stuff is retarded', and if that happens, it doesn't matter how good the structure is - the content is going to make you dissatisfied.<br/><br/>Real play example: My best friend and I love to concoct elaborate confidence schemes and our characters lie (and get caught in lies) all the time. My wife and her friend are at best indifferent to stories about liars and are constantly undermining our characters' lies and ruining our confidence schemes because they simply, out-of-character, could not care fucking less.<br/><br/>We can play together happily in a game where we're fairly well creatively constrained by the structure of GM and setting and rules, because then we can all push that creative difference to a level where it's handled "elsewhere", but if you force us to collaborate on something entirely new and independent, we're all going to be dissatisfied. And that even leaves out Tigger behavior which we are deeply susceptible to.                        </div>

                            Larry - I'm not sure if it's a case of not wanting to be creatively assertive. The same guy who when creating characters it's like pulling teeth; in Primetime Adventures, he dug right into it, and brought a lot of elements to the table, once things got started. Usually when my schedule says I get to game, I'm not 'on'. It takes me some time to get running on all cylinders. To be able to sit down, and make the game work for us, play, and have fun until we get into the groove.<br/>The games where everyone is encouraged to come to the table characterless, and build the characters as a group, identifying keys to play off each other and motivate the characters. This takes time, and it would be nice to grab from a pile of pregens and get started, letting the keys (and contacts, and beliefs, and all that stuff) emerge during play. Even years ago, it took me a couple of sessions to really get invested in a character. I'm not saying that this is a bad thing. I could play, and have a good time until I was ready to actually let 'my' story begin. That's the thing, when I sit down, I may be looking for a one sort of experience, and as play progresses, what I want may change. At the beginning of a session, I'm often looking for a gamist experience, which becomes narrativist once I get rolling. I don't think I'm the only one. How do I do this.                        </div>

I really haven't seen it in use, or if I have, it was done stealthily and under a different name so that I never associated the word "flag" with it.  The links you shared (and the links within those links) are interesting, though, and I could see how having pre-written "flags" available and passed out to the players might help with getting a pickup game rolling.<br/><br/>I don't think it would fix everything, of course.  In fact, I suspect that our pickup narrative games would still be awkward and unsatisfying, because as Joshua points out, there's a definite paradigm shift required at some point and I quite honestly have absolutely no goddamn idea whatsoever how that's supposed to happen or what it would look like if it did.  I don't know if it's possible to ease into it, to lay down pre-generated ideas and other creative constraints that will help (as JD puts it) provide an "elsewhere" to settle the inevitable creative differences.  I want to think that it <i>is</i> possible, because each of the narrative games we've tried has had at least one thing in them that I liked and thought was pretty fun, even though the play experience as a whole has never managed to work out well.<br/><br/><br/>As a side note to Joshua:  I really don't get what you mean by "short-run games with little to no prep or build-up."  So...er...what do you mean by that?  <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> </div>

                            Daniel,<br/><br/>If I understand what you're saying correctly, then the ideal game might be something which starts off pretty structured and then the players gain more and more control as the game goes on.  So there is an obvious path at the start, a situation which you can rock out with and react to at the beginning of the game and then the players can kinda take over with their creativity after they've "warmed up" so to speak.<br/><br/>Does that sound right?  Because I gotta say, that sounds like a superb idea for a game structure.  The idea which Paul Tevis (I think) mentioned about how he runs Con games seems to sum this up best: Six players sit down and are given six pre-genned characters to choose from.  Then he starts the characters off in a pit trap where the spiked walls are closing in.  Then, before they have a chance to react, he tells them he needs to use the lav, and leaves them to plan their escape for a couple of minutes.  So he provides Characters and Situation and then lets the players react to that as the first thing they do in the session.  I imagine that really gets people thinking and creative right away.<br/><br/>Maybe something like Spirit Of The Century with pre-gens?  Or maybe get character ideas from the players before hand via email, give them a week to think of their character concepts, then stat them out as the GM and hand them semi-pre gens at the start of the session and drop them into an interesting situation that gets them to react straight away.  So they're kinda-sorta forced to warm to the character pretty fast.<br/><br/>I can't think of a game which formally does this, but I'd be interested to hear from other folks if there is one.                        </div>

                            Rich,<br/><br/>That's great. I was thinking a bit slower paced, but I think the idea of starting In media res would be a useful tool to get things started. I like the idea of pregenerated characters, especially if there are a pile of flags on the table for them to take and 'plug-in' as play progresses (click and lock anyone???)                        </div>

                            Firstly, Larry is <em>absolutely correct</em>, and JD was saying something similar earlier.  Some people just aren't interested in narrativist gaming, it's not what they game for, and no matter how clever you are you will not trick them into it.  That said...
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>As a side note to Joshua:  I really don't get what you mean by "short-run games with little to no prep or build-up."  So...er...what do you mean by that?  <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/></blockquote>
Assuming you have players who are open to trying something different, running games where everybody shows up and plays... damn, I have to unpack that, too.<br/><br/>Okay!  So.  You send out an email: "Hey, we're going to play Roach on Tuesday."  Maybe you give a capsule description or link to Jason's site.  But that's it.  No chatting about how you want to set up the game or what kind of <em>Roach</em> game you want to play.  Everybody shows up on Tuesday, you create characters in ten minutes, and <em>you start playing then and there</em>.  <em>Roach</em> is a good game for this, as it's designed to ratchet up the crazy as the players just spin off into dementedland.  It's a good game for experiencing prepless, preconceived-notionless play, where the only structure is provided by the rules system and most or all of the content is provided by the immediate creativity of the players.  Additionally, once people experience how that works out (and perhaps as host you make it clear that you had nothing up your sleeve and you did not direct the motion of the Ouija marker), they can begin to see that games can be things unto themselves, rather than conforming to expectations from beyond the table.<br/><br/>Then you shoot out an email inviting them to a game of the <em>Pool</em> or <em>Capes Lite</em> or something, again with no prep (full-on <em>Capes</em> and multi-session <em>Capes</em> do much better with prep, though).  Repeat.  And then maybe you ease into something like <em>Primetime Adventures</em>, which does require some prep on the part of the Producer, but the focus and emphasis is on the creativity of the players, and the Producer's prepwork is only providing opportunities for the players to riff.  This isn't sneaking up on mode -- everybody should be patently aware that you're trying something new -- but it is learning the fundamentals of a new mode of play in an at least somewhat step-by-step fashion.<br/><br/>..making any sense?                        </div>

                            It makes some sense to me, but only on a strictly intellectual level.  I think I just don't have the right kind of narrative-game experience to really <i>get</i> what you're saying: I can follow along okay, I just don't have any gut reaction that tells me whether it's plausible or not.<br/><br/>But <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/The_Shab-al-Hiri_Roach.php" rel="nofollow"><i>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</i></a> (I googled for it because I'd actually never looked at it before) does look really interesting, and like something that could indeed work with our group as a pickup game.  It does a lot of the things I've been looking for: it gives us a bunch of preset tools to get the game started quickly and keep it moving, it explicitly allows players who don't want to frame a scene to opt out without making them feel bad, and it has a good, simple answer to the "what is this game about?" question.  I'm really looking forward to trying this one out, thanks for mentioning it!                        </div>

                            Larry,<br/>Why can't a person move through modes in a session without ruining the game. I'm not talking about 'tricking' someone into a different play style. I'm talking about having a game that can flex along those lines. Or, to put it another way, like most creative things, it's important to 'warm up' before actually getting into the creating bit. If this is possible, how can a game accommodate the transition from one mode to another, and then, (I think this is a long shot) can it work if the players need a different amount of pre-narrative to get rolling? If I'm missing the point, let me know, but I do think that there might be something there.                        </div>

                            Daniel,<br/><br/>I don't know exactly <i>why</i> it doesn't work, but a whole lot of accumulated, shared experience provides evidence to the effect that it just <i>doesn't</i> work.<br/><br/>(Watch out, here comes a bunch of jargon.)<br/><br/>There's a popular misconception that's pretty easy to form about GNS Modes... if a game contains any degree of competition and esteem-staking, it must be Gamist; if it involves any Exploration, it must be Sim; and if it addresses a story premise, it must be Narrativist. But...  ALL things we might reasonably describe as RPGs will variously involve those things in some combination or another. Rather, the correct understanding is something like this: when push comes to shove, one of these priorities has got to trump the others. If it can't, if it's not allowed to, then at best gameplay just... <i>gums up</i>... turns into this situation we're maybe all familiar with where everyone is politely hanging out, enjoying one another's company, but no longer really engaged in the shared activity anymore... you've got a stalemate where no agenda can shine without fear of ruining somebody else's fun. Regrettably, this situation can persist for <i>years,</i> until people realize they have better things to do with their time. (And that's <i>at best</i>.)<br/><br/>In the case of this particular prospective D&amp;D game you're talking about, I suspect your concerns that you'll need to build some kinda split-mode Gamist/Narrativist hybrid are unnecessary. You can have "this game is about throwing down and whomping the monsterz" and still have grand story elements that might superficially remind you of a more Narrativist game. That's what I meant by "glued together by dollops of other stuff." Just, with the caveat that any participant's attempt to Address Premise in a meaningful way is liable to get mowed over in pursuit of the greater goal of "winning."<br/><br/>And if what you want out of the game changes as you go, don't you think it's rather more important to plainly express that desire to the other people who are already playing and who may or may not share the sentiment, rather than trying to elaborately engineer a strategy for how that shift can automatically occur, maybe without their consent?<br/><br/>Oh hey, I'd been meaning to ask... What's the "Popularity Contests" aspect you mention in the topic?                        </div>

                            Larry -<br/>    I think I get what you mean now about mode now. And now to clarify. I'm not planning a D&amp;D game, I've been trying to build a group of non-gamers without being able to get a regular meeting. I've had some fair sessions, and several terrible sessions, mostly due to my inability to come up with decent hooks. We started with superheroes with MURPG, and drifted to Champions, then started to drift to a Sci-Fi Hero game. I started blaming myself for not making the hooks 'grabby' enough, while at times, struggling with helping the players (all new to gaming outside of games you get get at walmart) come up with concepts that they can get into. I found myself thinking about AD&amp;D1e, with the Roll Stats/Pick Race/Pick Class/Pick Alignment/Shop play character generation, random encounter, treasure, weather tables and all that other stuff. From there I get to D&amp;D 3.5, which has more of that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Out of this, I got two things:<br/><br/>I don't want to play Dungeons and Dragons<br/>I do like the idea of the game helping the players come up with characters and the gm come up with conflicts/complications/encounters, if only to get the juices flowing, , and think that this feature enables pickup play, and that might be one of the biggest strengths of D&amp;D as a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>The popularity contests bit was a little joke, because I have doubts about the "most popular RPG" claim that Wizards has made.                        </div>

                            Daniel, my concern here is this: you seem to be concerning yourself with how if you maybe get the ball rolling in <i>just</i> the right way, it will maybe possibly mutate into something that is fun for you LATER. Just... nuh-uh. Fuck that. Don't. Concern yourself with a game that is fun NOW.<br/><br/>That's what all the talk of short-run games with little to no prep is about. If you want people to give something a try, be up front about what you're playing and don't attach a huge multi-session commitment to it. Either people will decide for themselves, "Hey, that WAS fun! Let's do more stuff like that!" or "Well, that's not really my cup of tea. But I only invested four hours in it, so I'm not resentful."                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/>   Re PTA, got it, played it, like it. I've only run a pilot, so haven't gotten to really play with the spotlight episode bits yet. With the series generation phase, it's enough to get warmed up and ready to go. I have trouble coming up with issues early on, but from what I've heard, that's usually a sign of settling on a series that doesn't grab the players enough.                        </div>

                            Daniel, a little trick you can do is give yourself a provisional issue and set your spotlight early in the season arc, intending to change the issue during or after the spotlight.                        </div>
