My third skin ever - and third skin in under a week.  It's not as feral as the last two - but some times you don't want to be quite that feral.  And it's also a monstrous version of a missing slightly broken archetype - the Class Clown.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7JHnlN3e-1PM-5JXMTWOqePKDUKPshFal7gGhg5jLw/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7JHnlN3e-1PM-5JXMTWOqePKDUKPshFal7gGhg5jLw/edit</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429193/#Comment_429193" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-06T20:15:47+00:00" title="March  6, 2014  8:15PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there's a lot of cool stuff there that I might get to later.

Very much my bad on the diversity front.  After thinking about it I've scrubbed the names list entirely from both this and my other skins - my reasoning is below in reply to Mcdaldno.<br/><br/>On the charge of Cultural Appropriation, top level Japanese culture is IMO in the same position as top level British or American culture.  Cultural exchange happens.  A lot.  And Japan exports entertainment and stories in the way both Britain and America do, especially childrens' entertainment.  There isn't the power disparity or, so far as I can tell, the resistance that makes cultural appropriation harmful in many cases.  But if it isn't harmful (as I believe it isn't in the case of top level Japanese mythology) then insisting on hard boundaries enforces exoticism.<br/><br/>The irony here is that I grew up amongst other things on stories of foxes (including Reynard) - but despite Reynard being a north-west European set of myths, the Kitsune would be much more easily recognisable in Britain where I live.  Also although I can think of a number of British and Northern European trickster-foxes, they are individuals without, as far as I know having a collective type unless filed under Reynard.\n<blockquote>No skin should have only European names.<br/>Every skin should have a diversity of implied racial backgrounds.<br/><br/>I've probably failed on this count on some of my skins, but hope others remain mindful of it.</blockquote>\nThe first two lines are very true and I messed up badly - but on reflection I've removed suggested names from all my Monsterhearts skins.  It's always been the part of Monsterhearts character creation I've felt the least happy with, and thinking about it in response to this has made me think about and understand why.<br/><br/>In Apocalypse World the names are an actual part of setting creation and an implied setting.  And more to the point a lot of the names are not ones I expect to be names in the real world (<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=rolfball&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=rqoZU8X2KoaQhQeGqoHIBQ" rel="nofollow">Rolfball</a> springs to mind).  The Apocalypse World names list therefore says "This world is not like our world".  And it doesn't drag in existing cultural baggage so much as tweak a setting.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts is different.  Monsterhearts is about something that is <em>almost</em> the real world and a lot of the strength of the game is in how it mirrors the real world.  And Monsterhearts names are real world names.  This means that the Monsterhearts name list when tied to the Monsterhearts name description list is either deliberately or accidentally about stereotyping real world names.  Which is something that happens but isn't a process I wish to contribute to, so I've scrubbed the names list.<br/><br/>For the record I've just been through the basic skins, and none of them are completely lacking diversity.  Two of them appear to me to have token diversity, however - and unfortunately these are the Queen and the Mortal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
