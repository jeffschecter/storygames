That freed up the day for pure play, and me and the rest of the gang from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-RPG-Meetup-Group/" rel="nofollow">London Indie RPG Meet</a> ran a whack of small-press games and games on demand upstairs all day.<br/><br/>I played <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/witch/" rel="nofollow">Witch</a> again in the morning, which is a Montsegur 1244/Love in the Time of Seid-style structured freeform game. Good times, and we played with two folk that were just wandering around looking for a game: they were great, and one of 'em hadn't even role-played before and he rocked it.<br/><br/>I played Love in the Time of Seid in the late afternoon slot: I've played this plucky wee game 10 times this year and I love it. We had a corking game full of Stirring! Viking! Imagery! with white stags, heart-eating, a cultured and somewhat effete Earl played with great aplomb by Alex, a male heir being smothered at childbirth by a scheming Seidkona, and a withered King trying to do his best for his crumbling kingdom while his very body withered around him thanks to the poisons being poured into him by the Earl's ambitious son the Knight Tjor.<br/><br/>(The LitToS session did raise some interesting conversation afterwards regarding expectations and Theme Guides <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=12001" rel="nofollow">which you can read here</a>.

It went down like a pork pie at a Bar-Mitzvah - no takers whatsoever.  Another gentleman who runs a gaming group in a southern coastal town gave me his interpretation of this in no uncertain terms in that many gamers there were not very social (he used slightly more exotic language).  However, I had a good chat with a few folk.<br/><br/>I ran 'Dogs' in the afternoon.  I wrote my own town and shall post on an alternative process for town generation later.  We are having an interesting discussion on Lines and Veils on UK Roleplayers and my group ended up 'exorcising' a young woman with learning disabilites as she was 'a temptress.'  I had based her on Remedios the Beauty in 100 Years of Solitude, a book so dull that I kind of wished they'd stayed in solitude.<br/><br/>Didn't play anything but the best thing that happened to me?  Well, there were two: the first was having a number of us from London Indie RPG running loads of different indie games and getting some good feedback from the players.  Our six GMs were bedecked in <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=11167" rel="nofollow">glorious t-shirts</a> and it was inspiring to be around such an enthusiastic bunch of people.<br/><br/>The secondbest thing was going into the gents where some dad had taken his little girl into.  She began to sing a song about peeing which was so funny I had to leave the bathroom and come back later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349775/#Comment_349775" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T05:01:32+00:00" title="November 28, 2011  5:01AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seemed quieter than previous years, but that meant less of a scrum for game signups, so some positives there.<br/><br/>We sold some games!

I also learned that two freelancers were worried that I was annoyed with them (not in any way), in one case imagining me stroking a white cat when I emailed "I know I can rely on you."
