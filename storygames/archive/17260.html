(So step back Shadowrun and Hollowpoint fans.)<br/><br/>I'm talking about clever stunts, glitches, capable masters of crime and despicable Marks getting what they deserve.<br/>Something that emulates movies like The Sting, Sneakers or The Great Train Robbery.<br/>Clever characters, high stakes glitches, lots of room for improv and no GM.<br/>I got some ideas I'd like to discuss if anyone's interested.<br/><br/>What I have in mind is kind of "showing off" with later consequences rules. Kind of like InSpectres, but not as silly and (ahem) GMless.<br/><br/>(But please, PLEASE don't throw any virtues-and-flaws type suggestions at me because I can tell you right now: that doesn't work right in this genre.)                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391312/#Comment_391312" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T09:57:22+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  9:57AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been playing around with a cross between Wilderness of Mirrors and PSI*Run. All of the characters have specialties. Someone has a cool setting, a hotel or a compound for play. You use an oracle for set up. Then you plot the job. Each scene the player describes what their character encounters and rolls some dice. One of the dice is for success, one is for Harm, and one is for delay. the player decides which die goes in which spot, and tells their part of the story based on that. then you move to the next player. It is all happening in simultaneous pulses. The initial plan would have talked about who was doing what in each phase. Harm comes in two sorts, damage and notice.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391316/#Comment_391316" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T10:19:59+00:00" title="September 25, 2012 10:19AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The important thing here is to make sure that somebody or something introduces unexpected setbacks and twists into the fiction.  A heist movie needs guards to show up or alarms to go off or tools that need improvised.  You need complications and setbacks to keep the story interesting.  Ocean by Jake Richmond has a whole dice economy based on building obstacles (which makes obstacles needed for ultimate success.)  Fiasco does this with the white and black dice: half the scenes will be a setback or complication for someone.  That exact trick might not work in this game, though, if all the players are conspiring for their characters to win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391324/#Comment_391324" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T11:19:03+00:00" title="September 25, 2012 11:19AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2012 11:19AM by Felan.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a whole Ocean's Eleven-style heist campaign with d20 Modern, and can attest that a big clunky system is largely superfluous - the best parts of the game were the players all standing around the table, pointing at the map, drawing up game plans, and arguing over the best strategies, none of which involved the dice or the rules. They weren't speaking in character, but they were totally embodying their characters intentions and actions.<br/><br/>So, yeah, something that makes the pre-heist planning central would be awesome. I could see a two-phase game - phase 1, make a plan, phase 2, find out what goes wrong and improvise to come out on top. Maybe a card mechanic to introduce complications, a la Fiasco's tilt table (except with the assumption that the players will overcome them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391332/#Comment_391332" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T12:32:30+00:00" title="September 25, 2012 12:32PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are lots of things Leverage does right, for doing a heist game, that make it an excellent read.<br/><br/>It gives the characters earpieces so they can always talk to each other, even when they are not in the same place. Super important.<br/><br/>It has at least one, and maybe more than one, way for players to introduce pre-planning after the fact. I remember there's an ability called something like "Remember when I gave you that ___" that lets you introduce a helpful thing that gets a character out of a jam.<br/><br/>It has some good techniques in it for making the characters be characters, and not just statblocks, which is especially challenging in a heist game, where characters tend to be shallow archetypes and little else.<br/><br/>It's not GMless, but it's super worth reading through for anyone who wants to do heist games. You might not want to use the mechanics, but there are some core structures in there that are worth reading for.<br/><br/>I'd be more detailed if it hadn't been so long since I read it. And if I'd ever run it and solidified what I read in my mind better.<br/><br/>Doing a heist game GMless seems especially challenging, especially if you're not wanting to do it Fiasco-style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391335/#Comment_391335" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T13:09:45+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  1:09PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GMless obstacles are totally easy!

I was originally going to suggest it as a playset for Our Last Best Hope (less because of suitability and more because I was already working on an OLBH playset), but I got to thinking that maybe it wasn't quite the right fit. It'd be close, but I discovered I was changing so much of the system it'd be worth starting from scratch. Basically, in OLBH you define "Threats" at the start of the game, and add them to a pile that's drawn from through play; I figured you could do this more openly and make it equivalent to the planning of the heist, and then run through the rest of the game, with the end of Act 1 being the twist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391496/#Comment_391496" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T15:54:57+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  3:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Graham:</b> Bliss Stage is based on Otherkind Dice + Fudge and works like this. You have a number of different things you're trying to do at once, like -- in our imaginary heist game -- (1) avoid complications, (2) accomplish the task at hand, and (3) don't alert security. <br/><br/>Let's say you have 5 Fudge dice to roll and get [+]{+][0][0][-]. You have to assign one die to each of your three things, with a plus being success, a blank being a mixed result, and a minus being failure. Due to your roll, something has to get a mixed result and let's say we put the pluses in completing the task (descending on a rope from the ceiling) and not alerting the guards, leaving "complications" with a mixed result.<br/><br/>Let's also say that the mixed result on "complications" introduces yet another thing you have to do. Maybe the rope is stuck, leaving you swinging a few feet higher than you wanted, and you have to hang upside-down in order to reach the alarm controls you're trying to disable. When you roll to disable the alarm, now, you still have 5 dice, but have to assign 4 of them instead of 3: to (1) avoid more complications, (2) disable the alarm, (3) avoid altering the guards, and (4) have no trouble due to hanging upside-down on a stuck rope. Let's hope you get a good roll!<br/><br/>Bliss Stage is a bit more complicated and unique than that, but that's how it generally works. You accumulate the additional costs of past rolls over time and keep trying to juggle more and more things, all the while trying to complete your mission.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
