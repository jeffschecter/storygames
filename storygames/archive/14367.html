"We see my guy accidentally lock himself inside of the walk-in freezer. Cut"   They'll have plenty of opportunity to do more, next go-'round.    It's ok to be a supporting character if being a major one is too intimidating.<br/><br/>-You can also give players an early heads-up that the game has a built-in ending-generator, so they don't have to fret about inventing a tidy outcome.<br/><br/>-If the players do wrap things up neatly before everyone has played 4 scenes, it's ok to just say 'The End', instead of forcing more unwanted scenes on players.

Definitely play it as written! Thing is, as written it leaves a huge amount of latitude for individual groups to fashion an experience well suited to them. Stuff as simple as who gets to talk and when is deliberately ambiguous. What constitutes a positive outcome. How much control and authority anyone has over a character. Who has the right to edit, and when. Almost always these decisions are made organically, in play, as players negotiate the game's bones, which are fixed - what relationships exist and why they are in crisis, who establishes and who resolves, what happens to disrupt the status quo, and how the whole thing turns out. Every group decides for themselves, for that session, and there can be a lot of variation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gravity" title="gravity"><img alt="gravity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gravity">gravity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326621/#Comment_326621" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-27T05:04:34+00:00" title="May 27, 2011  5:04AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2011 5:04AM by gravity.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite></blockquote>\nThis pains me a little because it makes Fiasco sound like Once Upon A Time or something. Definitely play it as written! <br/><br/>We do play it as written (except this time we were one more player than recommended), but as you say Jason, there are much fewer procedural and technical rules specified in the rules set. In my experience, this is great for introducing adult non-gamers to the hobby. 1) Most non-RPG people I know are not into complex rules. 2) There is less time spent on teaching how to play. 3) Play flows more organically according to the personalities and preferences of the people around the table. <br/><br/>I know that if I'd brought Burning Wheel to the session last weekend and tried to explain the rules and procedures, I'd have been met by blank stares from the new players. When we laid Touring Rock Band on the table, read the theme text and quickly went through how scenes, acts and dice worked, I was met by exclamations of joy and excitement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
