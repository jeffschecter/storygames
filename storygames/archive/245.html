                    Not to be deterred by <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=120&amp;page=1#Item_33" rel="nofollow">my last misadventure with TSoY</a>, I have gathered another group to give it another go! This time we're playing in roughly-16th-century Italy, with a pretty strong tendency towards the farcical.<br/><br/>I'm much happier with the group of people this time.<br/><br/>The Storyguide is Michael St. Claire, who was in my playtest of <i>Galactic</i> and came to KueiCon. He's secretly running the game like Sorcerer, but in a good way this time, by asking for kickers to get things going. He's a grad student in the drama department, with an emphasis on dramaturgy.<br/><br/>William (from the previous game) is playing the first son of a prosperous Florentine banker who wishes he was the third son. That is, he's bound to inherit the property, but is more interested in the church. He's got the most Reason pool and skills of any of us, Secret of Unshakeable Faith, Key of the Family Protector, and I think a Key involving his religion. My prediction is that he's going to start his own little protestant reformation before too long.<br/><br/>His kicker is that his father just died in a duel resulting from a nasty sex scandal, tossing responsibility for covering for the scandal and managing the family right on his head.<br/><br/>Peter is playing a struggling young artist who's ultimate goal is to get a large church comission like the roof of the Sistine Chapel. He has the Secret of Inner Meaning, primarily for use with his Freeload skill, and a Key about getting work as an artist.<br/><br/>His kicker is that some petty nobleman just discovered that he is one-quarter Jewish and, erroneously assuming that he therefore must have plenty of money, is attempting to blackmail him out of much more money than he actually has.<br/><br/>My character is Marco Bruni, a Venetian adventurer in town looking for fun. He has Key of the Rake (functions much like Key of the Mission [seduce as many women as possible], but not quite so directed), Key of Power, and a boatload of fun skills like Disguise, Dueling, and Savoir Faire.<br/><br/>His kicker? He just slept with the young, beautiful, [until recently] virginal granddaughter of Cosimo de Medici.<br/><br/>I'm excited, and TSoY is continuing to show its awesomeness.<br/><br/>Key selection as Situation Creation is really neat. When you mindfully select a key, not only are you positing events that will get you xp, but you are positing situations that would get you to buy it off. I'm practically chomping at the bit to make Marco fall in love with [taking Key of Unrequited Love], court, and marry a poor woman, thus buying off three keys at once. Great story and six advances, all wrapped up into one nice little package!<br/><br/>I'm also looking forward to playing up pool refreshment. In the last game, it was basically dropped by the wayside because the structure of the campaign made it inconvenient and non-sensical. This setting, on the other hand, seems practically made for it. I can't wait to seduce a woman by discussing the finer points of theological propriety while drinking far too much wine!<br/><br/>On a completely tangential note, I also love how 'dueling' is listed under Social Skills in the TSoY revised book.                </div>

                            Awesome.  Please keep me informed about this.  I was strongly considering using SOY to do a game set in Thirteenth Century Germany, and I'd be curious to see how things shake out.<br/>

What's the magic dial set at for this?  Zero?                        </div>

                            Not zero, but pretty low. The most advanced natural philosophers have some alchemical-type magic powers. Advanced mechanicians can make fantastical devices, but they require huge outlays of time and labor to maintain. There are implied fantastical things at the edge of the known world, which may come into it. Older Rabbis know some Zu. etc.                        </div>
