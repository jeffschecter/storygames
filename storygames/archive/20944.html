As I know others on here are designing in the same vein, I thought I would share it and see what you all think: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hxp2iri5103l78t/AAAbbE33g9a5tmDQ2aOjO4zwa?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hxp2iri5103l78t/AAAbbE33g9a5tmDQ2aOjO4zwa?dl=0</a> <br/><br/>Quick facts so you can tell if this interests you:<br/>- GM-less<br/>- playing-card resource management -&gt; narrative control<br/>- the rules are 8 pages, plus there are 3 pages of character sheet<br/>- two previous iterations have been playtested in an exploratory sort of way by my friends<br/>- inspired by Game of Thrones and the Farseer books by Robin Hobb<br/>- although the rules assume a courtly setting, any leader with an inner camarilla structure would theoretically work (e.g. a president and advisers)<br/><br/>All feedback, criticism, discussion, collaboration welcome. Although I wrote it as part of a job application which I have now submitted (fingers crossed - it is a very, very cool job) I do intend to keep working on the idea... even if the final product looks nothing like it does now!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459644/#Comment_459644" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-27T02:15:16+00:00" title="January 27, 2017  2:15AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a REALLY interesting game, and I like the attractive design of the character sheet.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of potential here, and I like how the players can effectively challenge each other for control of the secondary characters and groups. The way "Bones" and the crossroads creates the starting conditions for play sound very good to me, too.<br/><br/>The card mechanics are very interesting. Character creation through "sharing out" the first deck is a very interesting idea.<br/><br/>Things I'm not sure about:<br/><br/>How does the game actually end? What happens? Does someone "win" anything related to the crossroads? Who decides what the fallout of all this action is?<br/><br/>Taking the place of the Queen might need some more careful handling. (Or, at least, I didn't totally understand how it's supposed to proceed.)<br/><br/>Some details seem unclear. (Even basic things, like how to compare the cards. Do we count the single highest value, or add them all together, or what?)<br/><br/>If I'm making effectively "an attack" on another player's faction, it's probably most interesting if the other main character is in the scene or elsewise involved. However, mechanically, the game punishes me for this (since narrating them into the scene gives that player a bonus on the card score). This might be an unfortunate dynamic, if I always want to have a scene without your main character present, but you DO want them there.<br/><br/>In a way, it might be more interesting if I get a mechanical benefit by making your character present! <br/><br/>An excellent and fascinating draft, even if it seems unpolished to me.

[...] How does the game actually end? What happens? Does someone "win" anything related to the crossroads? Who decides what the fallout of all this action is?</blockquote>\nThe <i>theory</i> is that players will let their narrative instincts naturally draw things to a close during the final scenes just because they know the story must end by the end of scene twelve. The setup is supposedly optimised so that everyone has goals that will be achieved/lost/rendered irrelevant by the end of the story.<br/><br/>I've found in play that the outer Bones tend to be the main focus in Acts 1 and 3, resolving by the end of the story; while the crossed Bones tend to come into play in Act 2 but don't really get resolved. The Crossroads, meanwhile, is largely ignored except where it is reflected in the Bones\u2014I had conceived of it as largely a setting conceit rather than an active storyline, but this isn't adequately reflected in the rules!<br/><br/>And in every game I've played there's been a power struggle with one of the players taking the throne. (I think I need to embrace that this is what people will want to do with the game.)<br/><br/>I think that the focus on personal interests over the actual governance of the kingdom is inherent to the genre, so I'm happy with how that has emerged (even though I can't really claim to have done it on purpose). However, I think you're totally on to something here. I want the format to be open enough to allow both one-offs and campaign play, but I also want players to be able to enjoy the game unfolding without worrying about manipulating the story. And, re the other thread about intrigue games, one of the emotional rewards we want to replicate is the epicness of the consequences of our personal struggles. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's as simple as adding a Montage of Epic Consequences at the end of each Act in which players can all contribute images of the world outside court? <br/><br/>It's definately not about actually resolving the Crossroads though. We can play Ben Robbins' Kingdom for that.\n<blockquote>The card mechanics are very interesting. Character creation through "sharing out" the first deck is a very interesting idea.

(If one character is authoritarian, the rule of drama means that another will be an anarchist.)<br/><br/>I would very much like to see your card game! I love the aesthetic of cards so the more story games using cards there are the better.\n<blockquote>If I'm making effectively "an attack" on another player's faction, it's probably most interesting if the other main character is in the scene or elsewise involved.

I need to rethink (with reference to the genre I'm emulating) how secondary characters fit in.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your stimulating thoughts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459800/#Comment_459800" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-01T16:58:02+00:00" title="February  1, 2017  4:58PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answers.<br/><br/>I hope you'll address the nuts &amp; bolts questions, too (mainly how you compare cards) so that people could actually play this, if you they decide to. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459803/#Comment_459803" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-01T20:37:18+00:00" title="February  1, 2017  8:37PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I hope you'll address the nuts &amp; bolts questions, too (mainly how you compare cards) so that people could actually play this, if you they decide to. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nHaha! Yes, I was so sure I'd caught of the unclear bits when I was copy editing too... There's always something.<br/><br/>For the record, the idea is to total *all* of the cards for and against the Challenge, no matter who played them, to determine if it succeeds or fails. Meanwhile, the player who has played the cards totalling the highest number narrates the end of the chapter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
