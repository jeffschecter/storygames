I want it to flow conversationally, like Dungeon World. I want it to be fast, intense, chaotic, first-person, and visceral, like the Middle Earth game Silmenume plays. And I want it to have all the mechanical and tactical richness provided by modern D&amp;D.<br/><br/>People talk about action economy in D&amp;D a lot. It basically comes down to, each team has so many opportunities to make progress towards defeating the other team. It makes a fight feel like a team sport, rather than a personal struggle for survival; and it makes people feel that not spending their currency to contribute to the overall effort as efficiently as possible == sub-optimal &amp; ineffective.<br/><br/>Here's a rough attempt.\n<h2>Spotlight</h2>\nInstead of rounds and initiative, have the spotlight move with the conversation. Say what's happening, turn to someone, and ask what they do. Keep going with that thread until you get a natural break point; often one side or the other's gone down, or taken some meaningful damage\u2014or maybe someone else at the table is jumping up and down waiting to tell you what <i>they're</i> doing now!<br/><br/>When you can, move the spotlight to whoever's been most quiet or acted least recently.<br/><br/>Sometimes you'll spotlight an individual, sometimes a small group of characters. Occasionally the whole party. You might try to spotlight one person, but it'll end up naturally that someone else, or a slightly larger group, is the focus of action.<br/><br/><small>GM: Around the corner come three orcs and behind them, in chains, a cave troll. They're as surprised to see you as you are to see them! A, you're in the front, what do you do?<br/>A: Rush to meet them in melee!<br/>B: Me too! Nobody's getting past us!</small>\n<h2>Reciprocity</h2>\nWhen a player says what their character does, the GM says how enemies respond in turn. Often one PC to one enemy, but not necessarily! If you're surrounded by foes, when you do something, maybe all or several of them respond. Or vice versa. However many foes react, it should be enemies who are directly engaging with the spotlighted PCs, or maybe using the conspicuous respite granted by the PCs' attention elsewhere to do the something important.<br/><br/>In general, however much "action" the PC uses, that's the amount of "action" the opponent responds with. In general, move for move, attack routine / spell / etc for attack routine / spell / etc... with bonus actions really being bonus!<br/><br/><small>GM: As ya'll charge down the corridor, the troll and two of the orcs scramble to meet you!</small>\n<h2>Exchanges and Bouts</h2>\nExchanges trade melee attack routine for melee attack routine, among everyone in a melee group! You can give up your attacks to disengage or dodge, or use some spell or special ability that basically amounts to a melee attack, but nothing else.<br/><br/>In a bout of melee, the GM will usually call for 2-3 exchanges in a row! If one side wants to withdraw and the other doesn't, they're gonna have to sacrifice their attack routine in a bout to Disengage, unless they can do it as a bonus action or whatever.<br/><br/>By a melee group, I mean a scrum where at most one of the sides has multiple combatants. So 1v1, or a PC and the foes that surround him, or a group of PCs surrounding their victim.<br/><br/>Let's call attack rolls maneuver rolls instead, here. You can choose to apply your damage from each maneuver as you roll it, or you can lump everything from a whole exchange or bout into one hit, at the end of the exchange or bout, whatever you like. Errol Flynn style fence-fence-fence-fence-STAB! Or bloody, gory hack, hack, hack.<br/><br/>Between exchanges, players should do stuff! Like try to wrestle, outmaneuver, whatever. This is where to try to grapple or disarm or push or shove or trip your enemy, or force them over to the bridge and fling them over the edge. If you try something and your opponent wins, they get to do something of equal-ish nastiness to you, instead. If nobody quickly jumps in with something they want between exchanges, the GM will just ask for a flat d20 roll. Natural 1s and 20s between exchanges are chances for the GM to apply the chaos of battle. People trip. Mounts rear and throw their riders. Blades shatter. Shields splinter. Quivers spill. Morale gives way.<br/><br/>At the end of a bout, combatants push away from each other, stumble back, have a bit of a space to breathe.<br/><br/><small>GM: A, throw an exchange against the troll, AC 15! (dice clatter). He's holding 18 damage over you.<br/>A: Fuck, nothing. I want to scramble on his back where he can't reach me!<br/>GM: Your Acrobatics against his Athletics! 19!<br/>A: 14! Fuck!<br/>GM: He plucks you off, throws you to the ground, and pins you there with his foot! You're prone and restrained! Roll another bout, at disad! (more dice clatter)<br/>A: Miss and a hit! Spending a superiority die for Pushing Attack. 19 damage and I throw him off me!<br/>GM: He lands another claw. You take 29 total from the bout.<br/></small>\n<h2>Volleys</h2>\nWhen the GM calls for a volley, PCs and their enemies in the spotlight sling spells and arrows at one another. Usually an exchange of ranged attack routines, with the option to give up your attacks to dodge or run for cover or cast a spell or whatever.<br/><br/>If you're smart and lucky, you might be able to get a volley unopposed: All the enemies are busy fighting your friends, nobody's trying to feather you in turn. If you're so free, and the action's been off you for a while, the GM might grant multiple sets of your ranged attack routine.<br/><br/>We'll call attack rolls aim rolls instead, here. If you like, each aim roll can be an individual arrow. Or you can bundle it all in to a single, deadly shot.<br/><br/>At the end of an exchange of melee, if there are unopposed enemies, they might get free volleys if nobody's trying to deal with them. Uh-oh!\n<h2>What's my Speed good for?</h2>\nWhen lines of battle are forming, faster characters or monsters get to choose who engages with whom. They get to shape the initial melee groups. Maybe you can Dash in order to choose your foe, forfeiting your first exchange in the bout of melee.\n<h2>The Action Economy is Grist for the Mill</h2>\nOf deciding what's "fair" reciprocity. But it's not the iron-clad law. Some characters may end up with more actions total, but likely because they're fighting for their lives, not mowing down all the opposition.<br/><br/>This is getting long.

(Btw one idea I've experimented with\u2014unlike my group social experiments downthread [wow, the life-changing magic of cataphoric reference enabled by post-editing] this was in a computer sim though] is that the hero makes one roll vs the moster's AC; the d20 + mod tells us whether or not the hero hit the monster (over AC means hit); the singles digit on the d20 tells us whether the monster hit the hero. (You'd want a lookup table of monster manual to-hit bonuses cross-referenced with hero ACs, for example +4 vs 15 means the hero needs to have a singles digit )of 6 or higher to avoid being hit)).<br/><br/>Kutulu (also mentioned downthread) has the idea that you can only defend against one enemy. Which makes the combat situation have incredible coldness; if you attack, you can't defend. If you are attacked, you can defend\u2026 ONCE. Against one of the enemies you are attacked by.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Some characters may end up with more actions total, but likely because they're fighting for their lives, not mowing down all the opposition.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis implies that the problem I had was that the "many-actions-taker" would be powerful or defeat many monsters. That wasn't the case. The problem was spotlight time. The "conversation" is not enough. Just look at that Dungeon World guide that the SA goons did (I really really hate SA but\u2026 this is a well-known PDF guide) and the examples in it. Count up how unfairly the spotlight is being distributed in this oh-so-natural conversation flow.<br/><br/>For 5e, the math econ thing is easy (my singles-digit-hack being just a toy) if powerlevel is your only concern;<br/>whenever a hero takes an action, the resolution of that action also includes an amount of actions by monsters by this formula:<br/><br/>[amount of heroes]:[amount of monsters].<br/><br/>For example, two heroes, eight monsters: whenever a hero (either of the two heroes) takes an action, four of the monsters also act.<br/><br/>Four heroes two monsters: every <i>second</i> time a hero acts, a monster acts.<br/><br/>With this you can use the same CR/matchup math as you're used to.<br/><br/>The monster actions need to be part of the resolution so that the heroes just don't fast-talk the DM.<br/>But, as I note downthread, the problem isn't the monsters getting fast-talked, it's the heroes fast-talking <i>each other</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483145/#Comment_483145" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-10T20:09:21+00:00" title="May 10, 2019  8:09PM">May 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;&lt; reply forthcoming from me, as well, once I know what the topic of discussion is! :P &gt;&gt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483147/#Comment_483147" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-10T20:41:34+00:00" title="May 10, 2019  8:41PM">May 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the D&amp;D5e action economy is a proxy for a pacing mechanism which has grown to monstrous size, devouring the pacing as it is manipulated by optimization pressures from designers and players and GMs, and should be destroyed but cannot without unacceptable casualties as its tendrils reach too deeply into the rest of design<br/><br/>...um, change my mind?

I want a little bit of that, but to really force that first-person perspective with some more continuity over time. Rather than, "John, what's this one thing you do? Judy, what's one thing you do?"

If you want to get rid of the action economy and make it so players don't <i>have</i> to take all their actions effectively, you need to change that.<br/><br/>The secondary fundament for why action economy matters is the initiative issue: earlier actions in the fight are more valuable than later ones, and this is all the more true when characters have valuable actions that can actually impact the action economy, such as status effects that lessen the value of the enemy's actions. In the theoretical corner case of two infinite-HP fighters bashing at each other it of course doesn't matter what order the attacks occur - you could have one hit the other ten times and then the reverse, as the combat isn't ending and thus leaving one side unable to take their own turns. The fact that the combat ends at some point makes earlier actions more valuable than the later ones.<br/><br/>There are three common mechanical developments in this regard that I know of:<br/><br/><b>Symmetric actions:</b> If "A hits B" and "B hits A" are essentially the same mechanically, then a player who chooses to forgo an attack is actually also losing an attack opportunity for the opponent. Insofar as the symmetry holds, it doesn't matter who acts and who reacts. Many games that don't have an action economy work on this basis; initiative is more for determining the combat pairings (the attacker chooses who they attack) than for seeing who hits first.<br/><br/><b>Paying for actions:</b> If taking an action costs you something, then that also neutralizes the action economy, as now a player choosing to not act is saving up whatever it is that they would've paid to act. Could be initiative or stamina or even a reverse-payment system of some sort - when you act you get a busyness token that harms you later.<br/><br/><b>False actions:</b> If all actions are not equally valuable, then the action economy doesn't matter, and instead what matters is the conditions that make an action valuable. Many realism-seeking games go this way: you might e.g. wait for the right moment to act, outright wasting actions just to make sure you are in the right place at the right time to take the actually important action. It's also common in drama games: if somebody has been quiet for a while, their next move is more effective for the surprise of their weighting in.<br/><br/>If you want to implement the "symmetric actions" model for modern D&amp;D specifically, the overall simplest way is to say that whenever you attack somebody, that somebody also gets to attack you (a standard action attack, to be specific). If it's a ranged attack, they get to move instead of attacking you (an outright edge for ranged attacks, but that's the simplest approach). Everybody still takes all of their turns. Your attack happens before theirs, so if your attack slays them, they don't get the counter-attack. Mull that over and you'll probably find some corner cases, but generally the math should work out.<br/><br/>If you want to implement the "paying for actions" model, I suspect that the overall simplest way in the relatively complex modern D&amp;D chassis would be the energy gauge approach familiar from video games: have every character start the fight with initiative tokens (a few more for those with more init bonus), and then every time somebody acts, they distribute one token to every other character in the fight. You can't act if you don't have tokens equal to the number of combatants to distribute. If two characters want to act simultaneously, the one with the more tokens gets to execute first. This doesn't <i>really</i> break action economy, but it does make it so that you can pretty much follow the natural action choreography most of the time and let characters act when they feel like it, within certain boundaries.<br/><br/>The "false actions" model doesn't translate into modern D&amp;D in an entirely trivial way, but the basic conceit would probably be something like dividing actions in combat into "minor" and "major" actions: the former can be taken rather freely as reaction to whatever else happens, but their mechanical impact is limited to causing minor damage or minor circumstance bonuses/penalties, or seizing the initiative. When the latter occurs, the character in question gets a "major" action, also known as a traditional turn, after which it's back to minor actions until somebody else succeeds in seizing a major action. The idea is to play a little jockeying sub-game of "minor actions" in between actually mechanically impactful moves. There would presumably be a skilled GM, ensuring that equally active characters using equally inventive tactics almost always end up taking roughly the same number of major actions per combat, plus or minus one. Basically, the more major actions you get, the more of a tactical advantage you have to demonstrate in the minor action jockeying to get one more, until the opponent finally seizes the initiative and takes their own major action.<br/><br/>My treatment here is relatively conservative and constrained because I'm thinking of modern D&amp;D - new school - specifically. There are more radical possibilities for how to arrange combat rounds in this sort of game, but modern D&amp;D is generally speaking so mechanically intensive that you'll have to rejigger the entire system if you go too far. That's why a 5e action economy reformation basically has to end up as a different way to distribute roughly the same number of spell casting opportunities between the combatants. The trick is to find the way that's most intuitive for you, and best helps maintain a fun and vivacious action choreography.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483160/#Comment_483160" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-10T23:18:30+00:00" title="May 10, 2019 11:18PM">May 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Action parity between whoever's in the spotlight and the enemies they're immediately concerned with.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis, though, certainly an area where 2097e could be improved; it's just so\u2026 like, with hack-and-slash in DW, before you know that the MC/GM can do hard moves (including inflicting harm) if you don't act, it's like "wait the monsters only hurt me because i hurt them?"<br/><br/>2097e tries ensures that each front rank hero has a monster to tango with, right? this is for purps of approximating action parity.

It's definitely worth trying.<br/><br/>Two questions for you:<br/><br/>1. Fairly important, I think, is "how do we decide when to move the spotlight?"<br/><br/>For instance, I'm fighting the ogre, and I'm losing badly. I'd much prefer the exchange/whatever to stop, pause, and to move the spotlight to my friend Lucy, who I know can finish of her opponent easily and come over to me.<br/><br/>(As Eero says, the hit point economy in D&amp;D is what creates the necessity for an action economy, so when I'm winning I want my 'exchange' to go along for as long as possible, and when I'm losing I'd rather it end as quickly as possible. Your approach has to manage that somehow.)<br/><br/>2. Exciting, flowing, fast, fluid combat is a great goal! But why in the world would you want to use D&amp;D with that? (Honest question.) Nothing about D&amp;D combat is designed for speed and excitement. Hit points often take away a sense of tension/uncertainty (e.g. I know how much damage a spear does, and I know how many HP I have, so I know I can handle at least three attacks safely), and every roll which results in nothing happening (from missed attack rolls to failed/successful saving throws negating effects to low damage rolls meaning nothing really changes) slows down the flow by creating "empty pacing" or delay without evolving the situation.<br/><br/>So, why not design from scratch, or go with something else?<br/><br/>(Silmenume/Cary's game throws out the rules of D&amp;D combat pretty much altogether to achieve this effect, by the way.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483238/#Comment_483238" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-12T05:41:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2019  5:41AM">May 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh Jonatan\u2665<br/><br/>Playing w/ Jonatan (on either sides of the screen) has taught me so much.<br/><br/>BTW I also want to say in this context of increasing the "time chaos" that we also have a house rule; in normal D&amp;D you can spend your action to "dodge" (all attacks against you have disad for the entire round).

For me the answer is that rpg systems for master-level play require hellishly complicated cybernetics. Newbies and basic interactions are one thing, but when you up the level of your play, you also require your systems to be quicker, with deeper interfacing, more precision, multitasking, error-correction and other such qualities.<br/><br/>Now, there are many approaches for how to develop these heavy-duty systems, but there is one theoretical tack that the D&amp;D system takes, which happens to actually be relevant here: when building a complex and dynamic SIS that gets used intensely, you start by creating a <i>baseline formalism</i> that gets to handle the overall rough parts of the process, and then deal with <i>emergent complexity</i> on top of that with <i>situational rulings</i>. This is what the D&amp;D combat system does, near flawlessly; we've dealt with various "platonically perfect" treatments of D&amp;D in the past, it can be taken as a given by now that the game's concept actually encompasses a perfect treatment of its topic in this sense.<br/><br/>In practice: D&amp;D's baseline formalism in combat is that everybody in turns gets to deduct HP from each other until only one side is standing; we call it a "round" when everybody's gotten their chance; you can fine-tune the efficacy of any given action up or down by messing with the action check (hit roll) the character makes to find out if they whiff or act each round. This is simple, this is reliable, this does not break. The formalism reaches its tendrils into fundamental tables (so fundamental that they are not actually printed into the rules as themselves), things like "you get about 4 HP per level" and "a sword stroke causes 4 HP of damage" and "10 feet of fall is like a sword stroke" and so on. A GM can internalize this math and this arrangement, and, bestowed with this power, make it utterly trivial to organize a work-flow for dealing with 10 combatants on a side, of differing power levels, each with their own variety of situational weirdness.<br/><br/>Once you have this formalism running as the baseline of your combat procedure, you get to the part where the combat becomes exciting, flowing, fast and fluid: because the baseline formalism is so simple, even-handed and one-dimensional, it is very easy to build emergent complexity on top. Specifically, you can simulate all kinds of events in the fiction with well-known, instinctive knobs that the baseline interface offers you. Slippery ground? -2 to hit for everybody! An explosion? 3d6 damage! Fire resistance? Halve in-coming fire damage! Clever tactics? Attack bonuses for everybody! Reactive action? Take your action now instead of later! Clever stunt? Take two actions instead of one, but both at -2!<br/><br/>D&amp;D specifically doesn't get to the goal line with its base formalism. That formalism is dull, simple-minded, repetitive and inflexible. I think, however, that it is a realistic design goal to make it so that your dance on top of the formalism, the things you do to gild it up in actual play, can well achieve the goal. And it does that specifically because the baseline formalism is so functional in what it does. The formalism doesn't do anything except tell us when somebody goes down in combat, but it also allows us to push modifiers into that process quite freely for everything else that could possibly happen. This is far from trivial, there are rather few games in between D&amp;D (1974) and Hero Wars (2000) that can claim to run on an universal formalism like this. And D&amp;D's is, ironically, the prettier of the two in sheer mechanical simplicity.<br/><br/>I hope that answered the question. I freely admit that this gets into the abstract territory where people's eyes start glazing over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483273/#Comment_483273" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-12T20:49:44+00:00" title="May 12, 2019  8:49PM">May 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2019 8:55PM by Paul_T.">edited May 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I don't know, Eero. Perhaps you have a point (if I'm even understanding you correctly; this is one of your less lucid posts, at least for me - perhaps I'm just being dense, though!).<br/><br/>Even if you are right, however, I still maintain that modern D&amp;D isn't built for speed or drama. And Jeph is <i>specifically</i> talking about D&amp;D5e (the edition is specified in the OP's subject line), not some kind of platonic D&amp;D-inspired ideal:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And I want it to have all the mechanical and tactical richness provided by modern D&amp;D.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThere's a lot to consider in running modern D&amp;D "by the book". When I played with a group of relatively veteran players (there was one newbie in the group, admittedly, but everyone else had played for years, and the campaign was a year and a half old), a turn of combat would often take about 30 minutes, and we often had to stop to look up effects and rules in the books (and/or debate them). (I actually kept stats on the timing, and could dig them up, if it matters! But that, in itself, is telling: if I had time to by writing down how long everything took, that says a lot about how unengaging and slow the process was.)<br/><br/>This is not too different in other groups that run 'expert level' D&amp;D5e. <i>Critical Role</i>, for instance, which is made up of people who have been playing the same campaign and the same characters for years, mostly exclusively play not just D&amp;D but specifically 5e, and have a support team helping them look up rules. Despite all that, their combats are typically about an hour long (someone collected stats on this over in the <i>Critical Role</i> thread). Their longest combat was over 3 hours long!<br/><br/>That's not exactly "fast, intense, chaotic, first-person, and visceral".<br/><br/>I get your argument that there is a platonic simplicity about the basic format of D&amp;D combat, but it's not built for any of the terms Jeph used ("fast, intense, chaotic, first-person, and visceral"). And the basic premise has a number of "time-wasting" elements built into it, like the whole "roll to hit" (often creating "dead moments", almost 50% of the time) and separate "roll for damage" (which, again, usually results in no actual action or outcome).<br/><br/>I mean, the whole point of the hit point system is to <i>pace</i> the combat, stretching it out: to keep anyone from making a decisive victory early in the fight, basically. And, furthermore, the whole concept of hit points and tightly bound action economies and damage numbers is about <i>reducing</i> uncertainty and chaos. Giving the players control over tactical decisions as they move turn-by-turn, at a level which never happens in real combat (you can stop to chat with your friend about whether you should use this maneuver or that, for instance). <br/><br/>Strict turn order is <i>all about</i> reducing chaos. Jeph recognizes this, so s/he wants to remove the action economy... but so many other bits and pieces of the system are similarly there to reduce randomness, chaos, and intensity.<br/><br/>Almost any other RPG system seems better suited as a starting point (maybe with the exception of Burning Wheel or Rolemaster, but even the former has D&amp;D beat on the "chaotic" front because of blind action declaration). <br/><br/>What if we slapped down cards at each other or threw tokens at each other? What if I could do everything I need to be ready by the time my turn came around? What if I could act at any time instead of waiting for my turn? What if waited until combat was over to determine the severity of our injuries? How about drawing from a Jenga tower with a ticking timer? <br/><br/>The "Cary spicy dice" game does this very well by removing formalism altogether - combats are incredibly intense and visceral (to the point that some players quit the game because they find it too stressful!), because someone's yelling at you (and sometimes physically miming an attack coming at you!) and you only have, at most, seconds to decide what you will do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483275/#Comment_483275" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-12T21:01:17+00:00" title="May 12, 2019  9:01PM">May 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2019 9:06PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well yeah, I obviously agree with you about D&amp;D 5e - that thing's basically never going to become a slim, mean combat engine [grin]. The D&amp;D that does that resembles the '74 text much more than the current edition.<br/><br/>But it's not taking the D&amp;D as your starting point that's the problem there, it's the desire to retain much cruft that is not essential to the concept, nor particularly well-designed for the goal on hand. Much of that goes into modern D&amp;D is massively contrary to the ideal of responsive, exciting combat. You'll need to drop all the petty circumstantial bonuses for one, just to get rid of that whole "did I count all my bonuses" dance, and while 5e seems to have less of those than e.g. 4e, this is basically a case where everything's gotta go if you're ever to get anywhere.<br/><br/>Regarding my argument about D&amp;D's potential, perhaps this helps understand it better: I am arguing that the baseline engine chassis <i>by its very conservative nature</i> allows you to play a more free-wheeling game on top of it without making regrettable decisions that cause unexpected, unworkable consequences. That is: the system being as staid as it is is what allows the players to be zany, inventive and imaginative.<br/><br/>A system with less solid fundamentals would not be able to give us the amount of freedom that D&amp;D does in this regard, while retaining a core structure.<br/><br/>The rules systems you suggest as comparison are either not as nimble as D&amp;D, or they're not capable of actual simulation of a SIS. Obviously you can draw Jenga blocks or flip coins to resolve combats, but how are you going to simulate the differences between a spear and a sword in that system? Is your solution going to make the game rather less nimble than it seemed at first?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483289/#Comment_483289" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T01:26:05+00:00" title="May 13, 2019  1:26AM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm!

For example, something like <i>Runequest</i> has less solidity to its fundamentals in that there is no clear way to make combatants stronger or weaker, there's no default interface for circumstance modifiers, and scaling combatants or circumstance modifiers is non-existent.<br/><br/>What this means is that the core process in Runequest is less stable and more prone to unexpected outcomes (judgement calls that need to be revised due to unforeseen consequences, that is) than it would be in D&amp;D, requiring you to play things closer to the designed norm to keep the system operating as advertised. I'll provide a practical use case to demonstrate:<br/><br/><b>This GM wants to create a Neanderthal Warrior</b><br/><br/>The concept is that neanderthals are sort of like the orcs of the setting; they challenge the modern human to prove its mettle against a physically mightier alternative. Greater grip strength, stronger punches and so on.<br/><br/>The neanderthal warrior should be a formidable foe; a single individual would be a shoo-in for the Roman Colosseum, a star gladiator. Conan the barbarian would fight them and only triumph after a hard-fought battle. It has a clear advantage against a single ordinary human, but it is by no means undefeatable.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D the neanderthal warrior is a <i>very</i> quick design to create, mechanically speaking: 2 HD (or maybe 3) and... that's it, actually. The rest is largely procedurally emergent for a D&amp;D optimized for fluid, quick, etc. what the list of adjectives said. (You could instead do the miniatures skirmish combat modern D&amp;D thing and spend five hours crafting a stat block if you wanted, but that wasn't what we were doing, right?)<br/><br/>This D&amp;D version of the creature does exactly what we want it to do: it is a formidable foe, but not out of reach of a heroic individual. We could see an adventure party battle an entire troop of them. Everything that makes it "neanderthal-y" is in the fluff and emergent rulings: it's sort of slow-moving and might have a disadvantage in sensing stuff, for example, if that's what the GM understands the concept to be. Its AC comes down to whatever armour it wears, as the thick skin gets counter-balanced by being less nimble than a human would be. Maybe give it a point or two more damage on a successful hit than a human would get, if that's the mechanical flavour of the overall system.<br/><br/>How do you create this being in Runequest? Will your solution end up actually more powerful than a human warrior, like the D&amp;D version is thanks to its greater HD score? Presumably whatever you do is going to involve determining a Strength bonus and probably a Dexterity penalty. Take care fiddling those knobs, it's going to be easy to create something completely overpowering or completely underwhelming! There is no universal power scale in Runequest the way there is in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The flimsiness of Runequest's core structure becomes evident: it's fine as long as you're pitting player character types against each other, or using monsters out of a book. New monsters are more difficult, requiring careful stat block design to get the effect you want them to have. Essentially, you're playing with a system that does unexpected things when you postulate a fantastic combatant, forcing you to choose to either slow down (spend the time to create the considerate stat block carefully) or take a shot in the dark.<br/><br/>Of course the point here is not to rag on Runequest; it does its own thing. The point is to realize that D&amp;D is actually very solid in what it does, and that this solidity essentially translates into more freedom of imagination in what you can practically perform at the gaming table. The core structure of "more HP equals more combat strength" does not mind an improvised monster like the neanderthal warrior. D&amp;D, having clearer and more universal fundamentals, actively enables creative freedom without descending into chaos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483328/#Comment_483328" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T18:45:29+00:00" title="May 13, 2019  6:45PM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019m only very superficially familiar with Runequest, but it also has hit points, so couldn\u2019t you do exactly the same: this guy has twice the hit points, so he\u2019ll be that much harder (but not impossible) to put down, and let\u2019s say the rest is largely a wash?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483335/#Comment_483335" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T20:07:42+00:00" title="May 13, 2019  8:07PM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The D&amp;D HD directly influences a number of other things aside from hit points.

That was the whole point - that Dungeons &amp; Dragons <i>in itself</i> is the wrong thing to start with. It just ain't so. Admittedly 5th edition is pretty far away from anything elegant, but it's still the same base chassis. It is not a fundamentally wrong choice in the way you implied.<br/><br/>Remember, I started from a 3rd edition chassis myself when I started paring down and building up towards my own happy house system. After what, 15 years at this point, it's nigh unrecognizable. I got rid of the action economy thing on the way, too, by the way, using a combination of the "action cost" and "false actions" conceits from my overview upthread. I don't think that it's impossible to end up somewhere similar starting with 5e.<br/><br/>Had you said that "Nothing about 5e combat is designed for speed and excitement" I wouldn't have batted an eye, but that wasn't the point: you were suggesting that the entire D&amp;D chassis should be discarded.<br/><br/>Note that this is all very relevant because hacking the action economy in modern D&amp;D is some pretty radical deep-trough diving into the messy guts of the game. We're not talking about cosmetic changes here any more. My own analysis of the matter basically stopped at the point where I'd have had to scrap the actual class design of the game to go any further, leaving little of the particularities of 5e.<br/><br/>In this context a perfectly viable answer to your claim that D&amp;D is not fast is that it actually is fast, even if 5e isn't. Presumably you'd want to look at those fast variants of the game to make 5e run faster, wouldn't you? Knowing that they exist is useful, and prima facie evidence that it's not outright impossible to achieve a happy solution. It's the opposite of what you implied, that the project would be doomed to failure at the start because <i>D&amp;D can't be agile</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483344/#Comment_483344" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T22:06:12+00:00" title="May 13, 2019 10:06PM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

The action typing may be a good thing for rigorous miniatures gaming, but the old way is better for being quick and intuitive, and not getting players stuck in analysis paralysis.<br/><br/>(The "old way" here is what D&amp;D used to do: on your turn you can do one action, moving if necessary, plus some stuff is so minor you can do it on the side. It's basically the same, except when you phrase it this way it doesn't devolve into abstract puzzle-fitting.)<br/><br/>The big, fat advantage of the old approach is basically that it encourages a SIS-based evaluation of the course of action: the question that the GM asks you on your turn is not "what combination of mechanical levers do you pull for maximum effect" so much as it is "given that you've been paying attention, what is the correct tack to take in this combat situation?" It's a single unified question. Aside from it being much more fiction-based (which isn't at trial here, although it is an advantage in my opinion), it is more unitary because you're asked for one <i>course of action</i> instead of a set of three actions.<br/><br/>The practical problem in importing this to modern D&amp;D, however, is that not only is your turn broken out into three actions (standard, move, minor) that you puzzle out separately, but also the actions themselves are typed. Some things that you might want to do are standard, others are minor, and you gotta care of the distinction, or you get the particular joy of rewriting the classes to account for the minor action type no longer existing.<br/><br/>An idle thought on a starting point that might lead somewhere on this: what if you could use your minor action, and possibly the move action as well, as immediate reactions? (We'd lift the cap on the number of those per round, of course.) Combine that with a culture of not waiting around for the player to finesse their turn, and you should technically speaking be back in the unitary action situation, more or less: the player's turn is one action, and they can mull over their move and minor while the others are playing, holding them in reserve or doing them when they figure out what to do or whatever.<br/><br/>Would something like that require major revision to the various ways 5e uses minor actions?<br/><br/>If not, then one could consider going a step further. Stealing from myself, I think that the modern D&amp;D combats would be much more exciting if players had reaction moves. If it were possible to use your minor at any point of the round, and there were one or two generically useful minor combat actions, wouldn't that be interesting? I'm thinking of something like "Focused defense", gets you +4 AC against a single attack, or "Riposte", lets you attack back if somebody misses you. Might help keep players engaged and paying attention throughout the round if they always had some reactive opportunity outside the vapid opportunity attack thing. (Vapid because it's a no-brainer and not something you choose - the enemy chooses to suffer it, you're just forced to take your eyes off your phone to roll the dice.) The fact that this would also ensure a certain baseline of effectiveness in action economy doesn't hurt; I've always found it a flaw in modern D&amp;D that players need to understand action economy to build optimal characters that actually expend their actions usefully, rather than wasting their minor every round because the player didn't realize to pay attention while picking their powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483351/#Comment_483351" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T22:52:46+00:00" title="May 13, 2019 10:52PM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2019 11:06PM by Jeph.">edited May 13</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/shimrod" rel="nofollow">shimrod</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Do the PCs use all the standard 5E PC special abilities, or are they somehow pared down?

Hirelings don't typically have any sort of special abilities.<br/><br/>We still have people waffling about using special abilities! It just happens a lot faster. I think the difference is that everyone in the damn room is breathing down your neck to get on with it, when we use phases, which is a lot of social pressure. In standard initiative, it's just Betty waiting on you, everyone else is still scratching their butts whether or not its your turn or Betty's turn...<br/><br/>And whatever bits of waffling don't require verbal back-and-forth interaction happen in parallel, too!<br/><br/>Also, phases make it really, REALLY obvious when one person is a lot slower than everyone else at the table. It lets the group identify what they're having trouble with and help them remove that obstacle. Like, "Hey, you should be rolling all your attacks at the same time." Or, "You take the -5 attack for +10 damage whenever their AC is less than {whatever}, or if you think you can take 'em out without the bonus."<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, OH! Another thing that matters HUGELY. In phases, the state of the game changes at most 4 times per round. In turn-based initiative, the state of the game changes all. the. fucking. time, twice (move + attacks) for each combatant. This means that, in phase-land, you often know whether or not you want to use a special ability WAY ahead of time. I know whether Fireball is gonna hit a good number of enemies without roasting my friends as of the end of the previous Movement phase.

If there are two types of enemies, it usually becomes quickly evident that players will assume one is default, and not mention the target when they attack that one; and the other is specifically called out. When un-obvious, there might be an exchange like "3 hits for 7 each!" "The big guy?" "Yeah."<br/><br/>Are ya'll familiar with pro-drop languages? Finnish, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, all to some extent, will omit pronouns and even entire noun phrases when the entity the speaker wishes to refer to is obvious from context or the inflection of verbs &amp; adjectives. It works like that.<br/><br/>(I should do a primer on the applications of linguistic pragmatics to playin' games, some time.)<br/><br/>We don't use minis, but sometimes we'll push dice or beads into clumps to visually demonstrate some spatial relationship.<br/><br/>We play that opportunity attacks happen when one character moves away and an enemy in reach chooses not to follow. There are frequent little exchanges like, "He's falling back, follow or OA?" "Hit for 9!"<br/><br/>Or, "He's falling back." "I stay with him." "He'll dash to escape."<br/><br/>Or, "I drop back!" "He's gonna OA." "I'll Disengage."<br/><br/>As much as I love the phases we use, it's <i>very</i> different in feel from what I've got in my minds eye when I think about the system described in the OP.<br/><br/>EDIT: I don't mean to imply that we're all preternatural 5e rules-wizards, but most of us have been playing since we were 10 and we're 30 now, so. One guy is new-ish, but he went head first into the hobby and started DMing for another group like 10 sessions into the first campaign we played (and for the moment I'm taking a break while he DMs!). And another is less rock-solid on the rules, sometimes forget things, but those negotiations are quick. "Fuck, I shoulda used Hunter's Mark last turn." "No prob, we'll say you did it.

So I set up a \u201cchewing gum &amp; hanger wire\u201d mashup of elisp, pandoc, zsh, zenity and sqlite to help me search through my firefox browser history (which it stores in sqlite) and add links. I also recently added a way to quickly add abbreviations since I use so many acronyms.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483365/#Comment_483365" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-14T06:42:06+00:00" title="May 14, 2019  6:42AM">May 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Speaking of social capital\u2026</p><p>it\u2019s weird, one of the reason I had to rely so much on rules is that I started out with like zero authority as a DM. People would run roughshod over me when I tried to speak (#patriarchy\u2026? I mean, maybe?). Creating rules was the one thing I found that worked. It\u2019s hard to create a rule that kind of enforces itself but one way to do that is to make rules that answer questions. Like, people would be like \u201cOK, who can I hit from here?\u201d and I\u2019d be like \u201cYou can hit that goblin\u201d and Bob\u2019d be like \u201cWell, that\u2019s just your opinion, Sandra, how about you, Ted, don\u2019t you think I could hit the stirge from here?\u201d and Ted would be like \u201cYeah, for sure!\u201d and Bob\u2019d go \u201cOK, then I kill the stirge\u201d. Whereas if I can quote page&amp;paragraph it\u2019s no longer \u201cjust my opinion\u201d.</p><p>But now after DMing for years and gradually building up social capital through my rules mastery I\u2019ve also found that I\u2019ve learned how to become more assertive in other contexts even with people I\u2019ve never played D&amp;D with. It\u2019s been pretty interesting. I also run a shikantaza group Wednesdays and I\u2019ve slowly grown from being a weirdo mousy girl that\u2019s that shyly says <small>\u201cok it\u2019s time to start now\u2026 if you wish\u2026 please\u2026\u201d<small> to like loudly &amp; cleary be like \u201cOK! Welcome, everyone!\u201d etc.</small></small></p><p><small>(Hmm although.. the increased social capital kind of coincided with getting inked! Maybe it\u2019s tats more than rules mastery! Otoh the third and probably biggest factor was going through 2 years of pretty intensive therapy where we did tons of exercises on being assertive in relationships. <small>Offhand throwaway truth bomb</small>)</small></p><p>But seriously I do think the rules mastery was a giant part of it. Between our first and second session ever (this was in <abbr title="Lost Mines of Phandelver">LMoP</abbr>) I learned about the Petitioner/Granter stuff. I had had a weak af NPC interaction \u201cthis town, uh, hmm, looks for heroes! that\u2019s right!\u201d which was weird because when I was doing improv I could always do NPCs just fine; but post mirror story I had a harder time. So I decided to look for books on it and found Unframed &amp; Law\u2019s chapter in it and wow, that was dynamite, made dialogues so much crisper! Because it turns out there are rules for talking\u2665 BTW I also use the petitioner/granter skills at church! Come to my congregation &amp; get emotionally validated\u2665</p><p>Another clear example of where rules mastery was <em>crucial</em> was <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22062/scheduling-game-days-in-the-grim-dark-future-of-the-year-2097-where-there-is-only-d-d/p1" rel="nofollow">date selection</a>; this was post therapy, post tats, post everything but they would still just be complete fucks about scheduling until I codified the rough heuristics I had bricolaged rattling round in my head into an explicit algorithm and put it in <code>git</code>. That was a godsend\u2665 I mean I had to do all the work but still. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23lawfulevil2097&amp;Mode=like">#lawfulevil2097</a></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483384/#Comment_483384" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-14T15:47:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2019  3:47PM">May 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Your group sounds incredible.

We just know the rules pretty well, <i>just</i> enough that we only rarely have to look stuff up in play, and when we do we usually can find the reference very quickly. And we have a few good habits around rules lookups:<br/><br/>People start looking stuff up when they have a jonesin' to use an ability they don't remember 100%, not at the point of application, not "Rebuke! Fuck how does Rebuke work again?" Maybe because you don't have a sacrosanct Turn, where you get to dominate table time and force everyone else to wait until you're done making decisions and doing things?<br/><br/>And we're good about punting. If we try to look something up and it's not in the first place we check, I'll say, "This time, it'll go {whatever arbitrary way}, and we'll look it up later."<br/><br/>Last, we don't use any supplements. Core + a campaign google doc only.<br/><br/>We're not godly rules-savants, we're just numerate, experienced, courteous, and hygienic.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Dear Jeph\u2665</p><p>it seems like you\u2019re moving between extremes?</p></div></blockquote>\nHaha, yes. Or actually no!<br/><br/>I've already vacillated between the extremes. The phased rounds we've been chatting about, and my attempt at recreating Silmenume's and Cary's play style. Those are the extremes!<br/><br/>This thread is about an attempt at a gentle and moderate median between the two.<br/><br/>Your comment around dilated handling time for this sort of IIEE structure fills me with fear, because I bet you're right but don't want to admit it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483401/#Comment_483401" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-14T20:49:53+00:00" title="May 14, 2019  8:49PM">May 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It took around 6 times longer<br/><br/>The time it takes to get one round around the table (six people) is approx the time it took to do one player's thing<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483406/#Comment_483406" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-14T22:28:29+00:00" title="May 14, 2019 10:28PM">May 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap, that's a lot longer!<br/><br/>From the other threads, it sounds like everything else about the fights you ran was excellent.<br/><br/>But, like, that's a <i>lot</i> longer!<br/><br/>You and I share a lot of goals at the table, but also run D&amp;D very differently; for instance like you've pointed out I tend to say "here's a rules framework, interact with that please," while you tend to say, "act only diageticaly, here's the rules framework I'll use to interpret your actions but you don't need to pay attention to it during play."<br/><br/>With that in mind. I'm reading your <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483404/#Comment_483404" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play</a> <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483400/#Comment_483400" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">descriptions</a> and thinking, "This is awesome but it would never work at my table!" Why? Maybe:\n<ul><li>I can't identify points where all the additional diagetic steps ("I roll laterally, to the side!" "OK, you can spend 9 HP to do that") feed back into the dice. The player could have said, "Kerfuffle, xylophone!" and you would have responded, "OK, you can spend 9 HP to do that."</li>\n<li>The increased handling time! That's hella big! I'd be worrying, hey, this is eating into the amount of stuff that happens in the session, the number of meaningful choices per human per hour. It's reducing the total entropy of the product of all the choices made over the course of the entire campaign!</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

resources to defeat a certain number of Hit Dice of monsters. It was to allow one-round resolution of combat for minor fights. This was actually designed for play-by-post! But I still think it's a decent idea overall, since 5E breaks so hard if you only have 1-2 combats before allowing a long rest.<br/><br/>I seem to have lost it, but I think it went something like this (the numbers may not be right, but the ideas are basically correct*):<br/><br/>Every HD of monster in a fight costs the party 5 HP. The party can simply pay the cost, apportioning the damage as desired, BUT expendable party resources can also help defray the cost of the encounter. A rough schema might be something like:<br/><br/>5 HP per level of spell expended<br/>5 HP per character level for expending a Barbarian rage (which is <i>really good</i>, y'all)<br/>2 HP for spending a Bardic Inspiration d6 die, increased by 1 every time the die size goes up<br/>3 HP per character level for using an appropriate Channel Divinity<br/><br/>Etc. Wouldn't cover everything, but could be nice.<br/><br/>You could even do stuff like have the cost be decreased by 20% if the PCs set up an ambush with appropriate skill rolls, or decreased by some other factor if the PCs, e.g., know the monsters' elemental weaknesses.<br/><br/>*Originally I had this weird blind bidding thing, but in hindsight I think it'd be better to just let them work it out at the table level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483420/#Comment_483420" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T08:02:47+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  8:02AM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What do I want combat in D&amp;D to be?

As you may know, I use methods similar to Deliverator's postal play skirmish rules in my wargamey D&amp;D to speed up play and deal with trivial encounters.<br/><br/>Were I doing this, I would try to retain the fundamental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws" rel="nofollow">Lanchester's Laws</a> arrangement underlying the D&amp;D combat model - it seems a shame to let go of that when it's basically the fundamental merit of D&amp;D's combat model as inherited from wargaming. Whatever else one may say about D&amp;D combat, <i>at least</i> it holds true that a group with double the firepower deals double the damage on the opposing side over a given time-frame (which is of course the combat round).<br/><br/>To achieve this, though, we can't let players buy themselves out of an encounter with a static 5 HP per HD ratio; rather, you should calculate a force correlation factor based on the relative strengths of the sides, and use that to determine the price.<br/><br/>In old school D&amp;D you could generally sum up the HD on each side of the fight and use that as the force correlation: the game generally tends to be designed in such a way that a 5th level character is roughly as effective as five 1st level characters. (Specifically: the combat longevity, minor attack effectiveness bonuses and various hax that the higher-level character gains are supposed to roughly off-set the higher number of attacks and circumstance advantages that the larger group would have.) Whether this holds true for a given edition of the game depends on particulars, and I think it's pretty obvious that it doesn't apply to modern D&amp;D for the most part, but it might still be a preferable simplification. Or maybe you should use the square of the average party HD multiplied by number of members, might be closer.<br/><br/>But anyway, we produce some numbers that can be compared to each other, and then use that ratio to correct the pricing on what the adventuring party should pay to brush away a minor encounter. This could be as simple as multiplying the base cost by the force ratio: 4 goblins with 1 HD each would cost 20 HP for an equal-sized force, but if the adventuring party has 8 HD, they'll only pay 10 HP because they overpower the opposition by a 2:1 ratio. The stronger you are, the less you pay.<br/><br/>Alternatively - and this is often enough exactly what I do - you could just run the game's own core process for a few cycles and let it grind out an outcome. This is what I often do for "large skirmishes" - those combats that have too many participants to be run comfortably with the normal swashbuckling combat rules with initiative and individual maneuvers and stuff, but that are too small to use proper mass combat procedures. 20-100 participants, for instance. No reason why you couldn't use the same principles with smaller skirmishes, too.<br/><br/>In fact, I'll just lay out my "large skirmish" rules for old D&amp;D here - might include something useful, and I think that it helps illustrate what I mean by "grinding the core process". I think it's quite beautiful how D&amp;D manages the Lanchester's Laws, myself. It's essentially still a wargame when abstracted out to this level.<br/><br/><b>How to resolve large skirmishes in old D&amp;D</b><br/><br/>At the start of the combat round talk about the fictional positioning however much you need to. Figure out which parts of the forces engage which other parts - there could be some bow-men, swordsmen or whatever involved. If you just want a result, then assume that all forces on both sides engage effectively, tactics be damned.<br/><br/>For each combat-participant who manages to engage this round roll a d6. The default hit probability is 50%, so 4-6 hits and 1-3 misses. For forces that have an effectiveness disadvantage (skill, equipment, whatever) only 5-6 hits, and contrariwise for superior forces 3-6 hits. You might have PCs roll their actual d20 to-hit rolls, as players seem to enjoy that, but presumably the scale of the combat is so large that their individual performance only has a minor impact. Similarly, if the forces are too large to roll all the dice, scale the dice proportionally: e.g. roll 10d6 and have each die count for 10 combatants in a 100-man company.<br/><br/>(You might notice that this is very roughly the same odds as basic D&amp;D has for individual combat: armor class and hit bonuses come down to this same range for approximately real human combatants.)<br/><br/>Because 50% casualties per round is a tad too quick of a round for tactical purposes, and because D&amp;D <i>does</i> have the concept, you will probably want to do a "damage soak" stage next: for each hit of damage caused, roll the die again and discard the hit on a 1-3; this signifies a hit that was too minor to down a combatant. The remaining hits are all severe enough to put down a foe (assuming they're 1 HD, as all normal combatants are). You probably don't want to track actual HP for 50 separate combatants, but what I do is that I jot down the number of "soaked hits" and factor that into the next round of combat, if such is upcoming.<br/><br/>After deducing casualties you're ready for another round! Do some more maneuvering to shift forces around and represent the tactical consequences of the round you just resolved, then continue on to dicing the second round. Don't forget morale checks where applicable. Assuming completely non-descript battle space, force quality and tactics, the combatants each cause 25% of their own strength in attrition to the opponent every round, with a binomial random distribution providing some excitement to the process. It's quick to do at the table, too, assuming you have enough dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483449/#Comment_483449" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T14:46:07+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  2:46PM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The big virtue that I hope to illustrate by discussing this simplified form of D&amp;D combat relates to the idea of proportionality: by rolling even simplified attack rolls for every combatant, the system automatically accounts for force parity. The force with double the number of combatants gets, on average, double the number of hits. And because more hits whittles down the enemy force quicker, the enemy has even less attack strength on its next round. The system very neatly, very succinctly respects Lanchester's square law without asking for the complex math that you'd require to do the same calculation without iteration. (The dicing process round by round is mathematically rather similar to running an iterative serial calculus on an abacus, except it also includes a stochastic variable.)<br/><br/>We might utilize that same idea for "quick combat" in modern D&amp;D context by saying that each combatant by default eliminates enemy HD equal to the square root of their own level each round. So a 1st level character deals 1 HD damage, and a 4th level character deals 2 HD. We could dice it out, too, but doing a static calculation might fit the modern spirit better - we want resource attrition, not an accidental TPK. Presumably any combat that would actually cause meaningful attrition by the quick combat formula should actually be played out blow by blow.<br/><br/>On top of the default force-elimination potential PCs would then use their combat talents to speed up the process and therefore reduce the attrition to their own side. To simplify the issue I would just say that linear classes (fighters etc. with their powers always on) get to double their nominal HD for the damage calculation, while quadratic classes (wizards etc. with daily powers) may expend one daily power per round (random pick?) to do double damage for that round. Half-ass classes (which 5e does have, I understand) need to be dealt with somehow, too. Monsters and NPCs and other disinteresting critters just get the baseline unless the GM feels otherwise.<br/><br/>The damage in this scheme would be distributed one half evenly (randomly) between the opponents, and another half evenly between the opponent "front line", however you want to define that. Individual combatants go down when they take damage equal to their HD, and thus do not contribute to the next round of quick combat. At the end of the combat you'd presumably convert the HD of damage into concrete HP damage for the player characters.<br/><br/>Something like that, maybe. The disadvantage of this approach would be that you'd need to calculate multiple rounds of "quick combat" to figure out the final result. The advantage would be that it'd account for on-going force attrition during the combat, which would make the numbers of combatants count more for the final outcome: a superior force could indeed brush away a minor threat with minimal damage, but the amount of damage you take yourself would quickly go up against anything resembling an equal foe.<br/><br/>Food for thought, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483456/#Comment_483456" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T15:18:04+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  3:18PM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "each combatant by default eliminates enemy HD equal to the square root of their own level each round" that, adding a spell level factor, could give the "maneuvering" value of spells.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483458/#Comment_483458" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T15:27:06+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  3:27PM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2019 4:21PM by Jeph.">edited May 15</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>No, the response then would\u2019ve been \u201cOK, make an injury roll!\u2019 and the player would\u2019ve been injured.</p></div></blockquote>\nAha!

"Oh, Injury!" is absolutely similar in that regard.<br/><br/>If that's not what I wanted, I would whip out my Everway set instead of creating the rules that I have here. Which, well, super nostalgic for it &amp; <i>great</i> setting, so maybe that wouldn't be too bad... many of the problems I had with Everway back in the day could be addressed by making better (more Karma-supporting) prep, and relying heavily on the Finchian trap-finding and Lawsian emo-petitioning that I already do today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483526/#Comment_483526" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T09:27:19+00:00" title="May 16, 2019  9:27AM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my own sake I got so swept up by the diegetical action that I sometimes forgot some of the dice-level restrictions that are in place!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483529/#Comment_483529" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T12:52:27+00:00" title="May 16, 2019 12:52PM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Eero, your simplified large skirmish D&amp;D resolution? <br/><br/>GW is thinking of suing over IP infringement. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>( That's essentially the core rules of combat in most Games Workshop minis games for the last 30 years or so).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483531/#Comment_483531" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T15:27:41+00:00" title="May 16, 2019  3:27PM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the difference between the DW action flow and the 2097e action flow is pretty simple:<br/><br/>When the DW GM says that there is a sword or dragon breath incoming, and asks, \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d, it\u2019s a genuine open-ended question. <br/><br/>There are a variety of moves you can make, non-move actions, and so forth - perhaps you could try to cast a spell as you are engulfed in the flames, for instance. If you do defy danger, the description changes which stat you will roll, too (minor as that is). It\u2019s genuinely your turn to act, though, in any case.<br/><br/>In the D&amp;D version - and I think this is what Jeph was getting at - you have a binary choice: roll to defend or go down. It\u2019s not open-ended. And since you will very very rarely choose to \u201ctake the blow\u201d, it\u2019s ALMOST a forced choice. <br/><br/>Then that happens again with the HP spend; same choice.<br/><br/>It does seem like an improvement in some respects on normal D&amp;D flow, but it\u2019s very limited and there are several steps in the process which include very few choices. (You can see that from how the player simply repeats \u201cI roll away/to the side\u201d in the example Sandra wrote up earlier. This is why my original proposal, as clunky as it was in some ways, tried to add some real choice into that step (do you parry or fall back? Do you spend extra HP to get out of the way of the attack completely?). Since we don\u2019t know what the next step will be, we have to actually listen to the player\u2019s choice and narration. In this, we could have a player say, \u201cI spend 10 HP to avoid, baking a souffl\xe9,\u201d and it still works with the action flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483534/#Comment_483534" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T15:41:06+00:00" title="May 16, 2019  3:41PM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Hey Eero, your simplified large skirmish D&amp;D resolution? <br/><br/>GW is thinking of suing over IP infringement. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>( That's essentially the core rules of combat in most Games Workshop minis games for the last 30 years or so).</p></div></blockquote>\nAh, but it's <i>also</i> essentially how <i>Chainmail</i> runs.

Blades in the Dark has a lot more of it where position/effect are two \u201cinputs\u201d to the dice engagement.</li><li>gave myself a pretty darn <strong>good</strong> excuse: this system worked perfectly in dice-only mode for 5 years so ofc the \u201cdice engagements\u201d are set up to not rely on diegetics. I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20652/spatial-relationships-in-verbal-games/p1" rel="nofollow">had previously <strong>deliberately decoupled</strong> the dice engagements from being too dependent on diegetic specifics</a>, including things that almost <em>every other DM on Earth</em> rely on the diegetics to determine, such as \u201cwho are hit by the fireball\u201d or \u201cwho does the monster attack\u201d and that\u2019s not undone in a day.</li><li>explained that the even though they <small>[during first session, before the adv/disadv change for second session]</small> didn\u2019t affect the <em>inputs</em> to the dice, we found that they affected the <strong>choice</strong> of dice engagement very often. (In programming terms: dispatching which function was being called.) For example increased use of grapple, disarm, shove from both hobos and monsters, and a whole new set of lesser-used spells and moves from the hobos, including rank switching a lot more. Similar to Jeph\u2019s example from DW where Alice chooses between defending herself or defending Bob based on the diegetics.</li><li>(and this is one I\u2019m getting the most frustrated with you denying, and this is the one where we\u2019re repeating ourselves / talking past each other to an embarrassing degree): Just as how in DW, there are several diegetic circumstances that are all resolved with Defy Danger, here there are several diegetic moves that are all resolved with a defense roll or a hit point spend. The <strong>choice of diegetic move still matters</strong> because it affects the diegetic response. Now, to the counter argument that \u201cwell it\u2019s all the same on the dice level in the end\u201d, see points 1 through 3 above. As I said, ironically, the killing blow is the only skippable diegetic move [I just need discipline for it]; if the monster can defend, I need to say how it does that so I can explain to the player why their diegetic position was compromised; and in order to defend I need to know from the player the diegetic <em>specifics</em> of the attack etc.</li></ol><p>Straw doll version of Paul \u201cNow, what does that matter, in the end the monster lives or dies depending on dice alone\u201d; well, that\u2019s if it\u2019s just one hobo &amp; one monster. But there\u2019s often multiple on both sides and what happened was that trap-finding and monster-fighting were a lot more integrated seamlessly. Even though one monster dies, maybe others are still alive and your fictional positioning still matters when fighting with them [for reasons 1,2,3 <strong>and 4</strong>] or dealing with traps or social fallout from defending/abandoning each other.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For the killing blow, have you tried, \u201cit can\u2019t dodge this one\u2026 what happens?\u201d</p></div></blockquote><p>Yes, tried it (I do pretty diligent testing of variant phrases &amp; discoursive sequences), ran into stance issue right away.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, on the issue of maneuvering vs attacking, I\u2019ll start a new thread.

I'm not trying to tear anything down. Clearly it's working for you - and I've repeatedly said that I want to try it myself.<br/><br/>What you're saying about stance issues makes instant sense to me, for instance.<br/><br/>I'm just having trouble visualizing your particular arguments(?)/statements(?) here. For instance, what I take from your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is that having a more vivid, descriptive fiction is reminding people to use other combat options more often. Is that right? That's a useful thing, no doubt. I've always tried to make D&amp;D combat feel more dynamic than "people standing still, whacking at each other", and describing the ebb and flow of battle is a huge part of that. Agreed.<br/><br/>That covers <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, as well, right? I'm not disagreeing with any of this - not sure why I'm coming across as being adversarial here. That's not my intention.<br/><br/>(#3, though, is the thing I'm most curious about, and I've never seen you actually explain what that looks like. That's what I was hoping for an example of. But I think, if I got it in the long paragraph above, then it makes sense to me.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> is the one I simply don't understand. In both DW and 2097e, the dice (in the literal sense) aren't directly affected by the narration: we still roll the same dice and add the same numbers. However, in DW, we don't know what rule or move is getting engaged until we hear the player's decision/description/narration. Is it Hack and Slash? Defy Danger? Defend? Just trade harm for harm? It seems to me that in 2097e, it's either "I suffer the attack", or "I roll defense", and, on a failed defense, it's always "I spend HP" - no way around that. But perhaps adding the option of "I suffer the attack" at each of those points has dramatically changed the flow of battle? (I find that hard to imagine, because I can't see players doing that very often <i>unless the action economy also changes, such that forfeiting defense would grant an extra chance to do something</i>, but perhaps that's what's happening.)<br/><br/>Does that help clarify, or just make it more confusing for you? I'm willing to drop this, too; it's not really a super important point. I'm just curious, because your statements about increased diegetic meaningfulness in combat description doesn't seem to flow naturally from the rules being used. I'd ask you to be patient with me, since you made the same assumptions until you actually tried it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm basically in your shoes a week ago (or whenever that actually was).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483684/#Comment_483684" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-18T19:02:54+00:00" title="May 18, 2019  7:02PM">May 18</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2019 7:03PM by 2097.">edited May 18</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>For instance, what I take from your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is that having a more vivid, descriptive fiction is reminding people to use other combat options more often.

That\u2019s part of the big hangup.</p><p>But for the sake of argument, let\u2019s look at that interaction, one where the player wishes to narrate themselves into an \u201cI roll defense\u201d (or into an \u201cI spend hit points\u201d) because that\u2019s their only way to avoid Harm Inflicted [<abbr title="lingering injuries">LIs</abbr> and <abbr title="death save failures">DSFs</abbr>]. That, or they need to think <em>very</em> outside the box.
