The entire dream was in sepia-tone; in a vacant sort of 30s New York.  Started with JM and I trying to get a pick-up game going in New York.  We were trying to play out of doors on the street.  Jason was dumpster diving for plywood so we could make furniture.  An ex-girlfriend walked up and asked if she could join.  We tried to explain that these games often dealt with uncomfortable subject matter.  And then Jason started making out with her.  To make matters even more surreal, JM had this really tight-curl beautiful blond hair.  Like an angel. <br/><br/>Play got moved indoors into some tenement walk-up.  Filled with a sort-of heroin haze story gaming drifters.  Enter John and Matt. At least irl i know John fairly well.  I've only ever played something once with Matt.  So, inside this house, things break up into LARP like sub-groups.  Jenskot takes me aside and hands me an ornately written letter from Europe addressed to my wife and myself.  There's no explanation as to why he has it.<br/><br/>Again, we all converge on this dank and poorly lit hall to resume the game.  Everyone has characters named Lance (specifically John and Matt).  I want to name my character Lamb (something) but John intercedes and insists that my character needs to be called Rex (something).  Everyone around the circle agrees that it's more pulp and much better.  There's talk about the how the story is centering around some sort of Ivory Door.  In a haze, they cut to me and it's my turn to aggressively frame a scene.  I say something involving a door and everyone looks at me like i've said the wrong thing.<br/><br/>I apologize for not knowing the story.  "what's the story" i keep asking to the group but nobody will tell me.  We've all been holding these flash cards.  It would seem we are playing a game of Jason's design.  On the cards are ways of addressing your scene.  A list of modes or questions that have to be hit.  In the middle of the card, as a choice, is the word "cabbage".  Jason says, "just cabbage it."  And i say confused, "i don't understand.  what's the cabbage?  What's THE CABBAGE?"<br/><br/>And then i woke.  Described it to my wife.  And now i'm still haunted by it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296303/#Comment_296303" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T15:09:11+00:00" title="October  8, 2010  3:09PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRu-kH79EiX9qAaE1-h5OdYfNqUG7WLRwsrNhSAnDtlEgXkILQ&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__qUEvsyNz7_xbSHya-uC6DxAuhDY="/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296326/#Comment_296326" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-09T00:12:40+00:00" title="October  9, 2010 12:12AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds super frustrating!
