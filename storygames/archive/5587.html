Maybe for some reason, you can't build anything near them (I know: because they're <i>hanging in the air</i> and <i>they float around</i>). So once you get through the portal, you can expect defending fliers to arrive to try to push you back through or shoot you down, and you want to get to the bases where the defenders muster in order to disable their capability to do that.<br/><br/>Now you're not attacking and defending these fixed points; instead, you've got zones in which invaders will likely appear, that you have to monitor with your own ships or vehicles, rather than fixed installations.

So portals have reasonably fixed addresses/signatures, and you can create an opening to push a mess of stuff through any that you know about.  Fixing the location of a portal deep behind enemy lines would be the job of small, specialized teams.

That is, things that can move. We can build them, yes, but it's not easy. It's costly in time and resources. And we still don't understand how to make a portal for a specific place. It appears to be a physical law that each must be unique. And also a portal will change destinations if the construction changes for anything but repairs (it's rumored that some of the kingdoms have an ancient canoe or wagon in its vaults, hopelessly antique, but with a very useful active portal). But where they will lead we can't determine until the construction is complete and the portal has power.<br/><br/>In ancient days, portals were crafted into the earliest wagons and river boats. Wars were fought over control and defense of these. But as humanity progressed, we took to the high seas and later the sky. Now, one of the best ways to ensure to safety of a portal is to build it into something that can defend itself, a sea vessel or skyship.  But as always, the powerful try to one-up their rivals, so you find these Portalships only with their masive fleets to defend them.<br/><br/>A popular debate among portal engineering strategists is whether you build a portal ship with weaponry or without. The "with" camp says that it adds to the defense, and because of the cost and time to build a ship, adding several dozen cannons and lightning generators is a pittance.  The "without" camp likes to point out that these costs could be moved to the defending fleet, and by keeping the Portalship from being a threat, it reduces the chance for accidental destruction, and add to do otherwise is short-sighted. The "with" camp counters by claiming they are "designing in surrender". <br/><br/>Elite squads get sent into the portals, sometimes leading work crews, to extract useful things from the world on the otherside. More than one squad over the centuries has returned to the entry point only to find their portal gone, the ship that generated it, destroyed. For this reason, we must be cautious not to send too many through at once, or as they say in the north, too many that you hope to see again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125239/#Comment_125239" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T13:41:02+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  1:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Andy's model is going to be the one I take on.
