There was a book called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2:_The_Edge_of_Human" rel="nofollow">Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human</a>, but I'll confess I never got around to reading it.  I heard there were even more, but I don't think I ever saw them on bookshelves.  Whatever the case, there are at least sequel possibilities and even a little prequel action if you want to go that way, all of which could/would feature Rick Deckard, blade runner extraordinaire.<br/><br/>As a hobbyist community we actually do a fair amount of playing in other media's back yards.  The <i>Star Wars</i> roleplaying game (d6 and d20) sold to <i>somebody</i> and I'm sure they were played.  I'll admit I even used to play the infamous <i>Indiana Jones</i> game that TSR put out.  How about <i>Marvel Super Heroes</i>?  The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>In most of these cases you're not playing the <i>characters</i> that typify the setting, but new creations that live in the same world.  In the <i>James Bond 007</i> roleplaying game you're not Bond, but another MI-6 agent.  In <i>Star Wars</i> you might be Jedi, but you're not playing Obi-Wan Kenobi.  And so on.<br/><br/>What's stopping us?<br/><br/>If we can take command of a media property and bend it to our will with new stories, why can't we seize the characters themselves and do what we wish?  Is there some unspoken guideline?  Thou shalt not take a canon character for thine own?  Is it wanting to have complete ownership of a character, which is something we can never do if we choose to play Rick Deckard?  From one perspective it almost seems as though we'd enjoy the game <i>more</i> if we were playing canon characters, like a grown-up version of imaginative action figure play.  Why isn't that the case, then?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250438/#Comment_250438" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T06:22:34+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  6:22AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A long time back, a friend and I started the first two roleplay-oriented MUSHes on the Internet.

It just never came to me, it's so "in the hobby" to set your games in the world in a way where:<br/>* You have a new character with a destiny not tied to the canon<br/>* You separate yourselves from the canon as much as possible in order to not have it lorded over your PCs actions<br/><br/>But now that I think of it, I'd love to "re-invent" some canon (ala Star Trek movie, FUCK the "alt timeline" shit as an excuse to do so) by having the players take on the roles of some of the known heroes. Star Trek, Dragonlance, Buffy and the like espeically.

If I'm Luke between Yavin IV and Hoth, I *must* be more-or-less unchanged by the time I get to the Hoth base--I can't go to the Dark Side or try to knock boots with Leia, that's for sure!<br/><br/>* But conversely, folks are afraid to totally derail canon. I *could* very well rack up Dark Side Points between Yavin IV and Hoth, and go to the Dark Side, and Episodes V and VI just don't happen. Maybe the second Death Star is planned and under construction. Maybe Han and Leia hook up. But there's little chance I'm going to be helping the Rebels at the Battle of Hoth, slicing up AT-ATs and such. More likely, I'm on my way to find Vader or Palpatine and take my rightful place as ruler of the galaxy! *shakes fist*<br/><br/>* And THAT bothers folks who want to keep some notion of a "party" together--to play as a group--and yet canon characters so-often have to split up or have conflicting goals (or, in the Luke Goes Dark Scenario, one could totally overshadow the others and, basically, do a TPK or make them all sidekicks).<br/><br/>* And further, a lot of folks want to "make their own mark," even in a canon universe. The RPG itch is NOT the same as the recreationist itch: I don't RP only to figure out how it would feel to be Luke in the duel with Vader in Ep V; I RP to have control over when or even *if* that duel occurs! And if a canon also includes a plot line (most definitions of canon imply that) then I'd have to make my mark on the universe in some parallel but equally important venture. Luke et al destroyed the Death Star, you say? Big whoop--I captured and am piloting the Sun Crusher. Tell that Padawan he can call me General Fandango; and have him report for mess duty, for destroying a super-asset rather than capturing it!!!<br/><br/>* And finally, in the "canon mix-and-match"--where some canon characters mix with non-canon characters (all as PCs)--there is almost inevitable deprotagonization. You're Drano Inna-Kho'mode, the fearsome rogue pilot and swashbuckler? Yeah, well I'm FUCKING HAN SOLO. So suck it.<br/><br/>And all that above is why, if I were to run anything in a canon universe again:<br/><br/>+ The PCs can NOT be canon characters.<br/><br/>+ The canon plot line will run with its Major Events ONLY... and there IS no "Luke" or "Leia" to save the day. Or if there are, they show up a day late and a dollar short, thankful of the PCs for picking up their slack!<br/><br/>Lando would basically be a PC in "my style" of canon play: the "game" started around mid-EP V, and Lando is one of the main PCs... and, by the end of Ep VI, he's the one to blow up the Death Star while the NPC "heroes" Luke, Leia, and Han either distract Vader and Palpatine with a bunch of whinging and whining, or have the boring job of knocking out some planet-based energy shield guarded by mooks, with the help pf primitive teddy bears.<br/><br/>If anyone gets deprotagonized, it will be *the canon protagonists*, not my game's PCs.<br/><br/>My 2\xa2....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

IOW, canon characters are often an easier to grasp concept for new players ( whether new to gaming in general or new to a specific game/genre).<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Destiny: This seems like the big one to me, actually, especially as a setting+characters develops. For example, I know Mouse Alexander dies in one of the later Easy Rawlins books ( I forget which right now), which may well act as a limitation on when I can set any stories in that setting.<br/><br/>Personality: Minor deal to me, personally. This seems more of an issue of insuring a player is aware of the canon being used. I've seen at least one game where the writer commonly has players make arguments for why they should be the player of specific characters. With long-running canon characters, there is usually room for interpretation or re-interpretation. After all, Robert Downey and Basil Rathbone do Holmes differently in film.<br/><br/>More in a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250627/#Comment_250627" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T09:17:48+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  9:17AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Sorry Tristan, I forget that deadpan humor doesn't translate well to the internet sometimes.</blockquote>\nI did get the humor.

I'm sometimes not sure it comes through.<br/><br/>Without completely derailing the direction of the thread, could we (not you specifically Tristan) perhaps table the discussion of the Pro- points for laying with player created characters in a known property/numbers filed off setting?<br/><br/>The reason for my request is, well, frankly it's a pretty thoroughly explored topic. I mean, games have been doing that since D&amp;D came out. There seems to hae been less thought put towards going directly with canon characters in their native environment.<br/><br/>I mean, what about character death? How could/should that be addressed?<br/><br/>What about the timing of adventures within canon?<br/><br/>Or really, what about the way broad genre elements interact with the specifics of the particular property? Why is a Holmes mystery different from a Marlow mystery different from a Rawlins mystery, and so on?<br/><br/>What about interpretting those key canon characters? How to convey well that concept, while still giving room to manuever for the players?<br/><br/>What about the issue of on-going properties and how that may change how a character acts or how a player interprets them in play?<br/><br/>How does a company or designer deal with canon as a whole and convey that to a player with limited knowledge of the property? What about the way various canon characters interact with one another at different times? Are there broad elements than may not have been discussed game-wise before in designs? ( I mean, I don't know the rules for the Buffy game, but did it deal with the whole romantic relationship thing between characters that was such a big part of the series? Did it do it mechanically?)<br/><br/>On a related question, has anyone taken a look at canon stuff, and developed questions about interpretation or re-interpretation of characters and situation? For example, the relationship between Holmes and Watson has been talked about by fans and different writers multiple times. If one was writiing a Holmes game, would part of the preliminaries be for the play group to re-interpret that, sort of Holmes-Burning, I guess?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250646/#Comment_250646" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T12:17:00+00:00" title="January 13, 2010 12:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were going to run a game with canon characters, I would immediately give up on the idea of maintaining continuity with future published material.

Maybe you don't need an anchor. Depends on how the game evolved.<br/><br/>I definitely wouldn't expect the players to keep their characters the same.

The roleplayers playing canon characters probably outnumber roleplayers not playing canon characters right now by a factor of 100 to 1000, by a brief spin around Yahoogroups and other such places.

This isn't necessarily rational, we understand intellectually that the game is our own and we can do what we want, but I thnk it just creates a certain level of cognitive dissonance: to take Serenity as an example, I'd have a damn hard time playing Wash as the happy-go-lucky goofball who can't ever quite figure out how he landed the hot Amazon when I know that at some point he's going to get a telephone pole through his chest (and I have the sense memory of seeing a theater full of young women literally SOBBING as they left the sneak preview screening I saw...).<br/><br/>My wife explained to me that part of the appeal of 'bad' genre fiction to fanfic writers is that the worse the writing on the show is, the more hooks you have to hang new stories on, the more you can point to inconsistencies or unanswered questions that give you license to have character behave, um, out of character. The better, tighter, and more coherent the established ending of any story, the harder it is to access for new adventures, and I think we can all agree that even those of us who want to play the characters themselves probably aren't necessarily interested in just rehashing the exact scenarios of the media.<br/><br/>As others have talked around, I think the most fruitful way to play 'in genre' is to pick the point where you drop into the canon an be very very clear about the fact that everything everyone knows from that point forward is null and void. You can do it ala the 'Star Trek' reboot ("Whatever we were before this alteration of the time line, we are on a different destiny now...") and go ahead and be Kirk and Spock and Bones and have the adventures you want using the actual canon characters and even replay some of your favorite episodes with the understanding that nothing is set in stone, or you can do it the way I'd run Star Wars if I ever got the urge: "Episode V: After the failed Rebel attack on the Empire's new Death Star weapon, Luke Skywalker is missing and presumed dead, and the fledgling Rebel alliance has been scattered across the galaxy aftere the destruction of its base on the moon of Yavin. Rumors abound that the Queen of Alderann in Exile, Leia Organa I, has a secret contingency plan in place but no one has any clue what that might be.' What do you do?<br/><br/>Granted this isn't <i>exactly</i> the same as playing Luke Skywalker, but if you're working towards the same goals against the canon villains and such with stand-ins (and seriously, anyone who's ever even thought about playing a Star Wars canon game likely wants a shot at choking out Tarkin with their own bare hands...) and a bit of a twist, it's as close as matters, at least IMO.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251151/#Comment_251151" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-16T15:46:36+00:00" title="January 16, 2010  3:46PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryant</cite>If I were going to run a game with canon characters, I would immediately give up on the idea of maintaining continuity with future published material.</blockquote>\nSounds like my cue!<br/><br/>So about a year ago I ran <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/adventures-of-redneck-luke-n-genocidal-leia/" rel="nofollow">a con game based on the Skywalker Paradigm</a>, this crazed fan's analysis of the original movies as propaganda (he had a website, but it's sadly defunct). The gist is, the Empire is sure jerky but the rebels are Royalist douchebags themselves, Leia is a manipulative demagogue, Obi-Wan is a manipulative fanatic, Vader is ruthless but ideal-driven, and Luke is caught in their power-struggle. Solar System was a great fit: Abilities and Secrets sketch out the beloved character you're familiar with, and Keys were a perfect way to highlight the crucial differences.<br/><br/>The PCs were Luke, Obi-Wan, Leia, Han and Vader, of course. We began at the escape from Tatooine, and had a crazy whirlwind blood-operatic blast, culminating with mostly everyone killing each other in the Death Star Docking bay. The whole thing went off like...some thing that goes off well.<br/><br/>so what made it work for us: for starters, the mix of familiarity and unfamiliarity: everyone knows who Han Solo and Darth Vader are, and what they're like. But altering something about them or their context gives you a springboard for fresh play. In this case it's a subversive sort of "here's what was they were REALLY up to" sort of alternate interpretation." You can also handle it by saying "so here's how events transpired differently," like Jim's talking about doing. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4866&amp;page=1#Comment_109176" rel="nofollow">JD Corley's infamous "Arrested Development'style" Star Wars game</a> is doing a little of both: character motivations AND recorded events are being tweaked with.<br/><br/>But of course Jim and JD's ideas both involve playing <i>other</i> characters in a canonical context. In my game you played the <i>real deal</i>, with just enough wiggle room to make them your own. I also ran a Marvel Super-Heroes one-shot where the players got to offer their portrayals of the Fantastic Four and sundry as blunt commentary on what's "really" going on in THAT dynamic. And that was a blast too.<br/><br/>It also strikes me that there are two types of "canon" for our purposes. There's "closed-system" material where the story is pretty much told (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and such), and then there's the more wide-open types of "properties" that consist of a somewhat-unconnected string of individual stories, like Conan, original Star Trek, superhero comics, and such. in the former, playing "in" the canon as the star players involves tweaking something so that you've got your own voice: again, altering the characters or diverging the course of events. But in the case of the latter...you can play Sherlock Holmes, or Fafhrd and Grey Mouser, or Spider-Man, or whatever, pretty much with impunity if it strikes your fancy; it's less "move outta the way, established continuity!" and more "Spider-man's having an adventure! He has lots of adventures, so what's one more?"<br/><br/>There are some issues to conquer, yes. Like the "differing interpretations of the character" one, or the "only one character really matters in these stories" one. But I'm here to tell ya it can be done! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div

Meaning the better we know them, the more difficult it becomes to make them our own.<br/><br/>Certainly we all have ideas of the <i>what if?</i> variety.  What if Luke went to the Dark Side.  What if Ben Kenobi turned out to be Luke's father.  And so on.  But all of these things basically involve changing the circumstances, while the core remains exactly the same.  I mean, Luke's going to remain Luke whether he goes to the Dark Side or not.  And Ben's going to be Ben even if he's been telling whoppers to Luke all along.<br/><br/>Contrast this with a game where the players take on the roles of the Three Musketeers.  Unless the players are big Dumas fans, they only have a basic understanding of the character types and where they're coming from.  This is almost like giving the players carte blanche to do and act however they like, though they are ostensibly playing canon characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251267/#Comment_251267" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T11:32:09+00:00" title="January 18, 2010 11:32AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, changing circumstances are a big help in what I'm talking about. Then again, it strikes me that if you play with "canon" characters, SOMEthing's going to have to alter, either the circumstances immediately BEFORE play...or the circumstances immediately after. 'cuz if we're going to game something, we want something new out of it, so we find some way to make it our own. I remember the opening stages of my Skywalker Paradigm game were awkward because I began with the Cantina Scene, which was too early to diverge--the need to escape the blockade to have a game at all--so we just fumbled around aping the canonical scene until we could get to the "real" roleplaying.<br/><br/>So in an overall, shall we say <i>Corleyan</i> sense we're never playing in the <i>actual canon.</i> We're always only ever playing OUR canon, which is as it should be.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11277/playing-in-the-canon" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11277/playing-in-the-canon" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11277/playing-in-the-canon/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11277%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11277%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
