I\u2019d run Dogs at a local game store and for some gaming buddies last year. Neither event generated an opportunity for more play until now. I contacted David Artman and my gaming buddy Jon. Jon first saw Dogs at MACE 2006 and wanted to play. <br/><br/>We weren\u2019t sure what we were going to play, or who was going to run, but I had a town written up. David had a notion for Banthas in the Vineyard, but Jon also wanted to play vanilla Dogs to solidify our grasp on the rules and rituals of playing it. So we decided to play a couple of towns or three and start. After that we\u2019d try our hand at Banthas. <br/><br/>Jon and I hadn\u2019t had dinner. We started off at a diner next to the game store, spreading out the generation worksheets and rules and dice. I\u2019d never done that before, and I enjoyed drinking inappropriate amounts of sweet tea while Jon and David completed their Dogs.<br/><br/>David\u2019s character (Jonas Tinker) was a pacifist. In fact, one of his Traits was \u201cI never use a weapon on a human.\u201d Jonas had the stamp of destiny on him, and was raised in a town where pride is not tolerated; among the Faithful he was Lareth the Beautiful. Jonas however was not made for working in the fields or fighting. He\u2019d led a sheltered life and joining the Dogs marked his first journey into the world at large.<br/><br/>Jon\u2019s character (Judas) had a complicated background and took a relationship with a demon. Jon pretty much said he was interested in playing a character that would either kill or be killed, eventually, by the other Dogs. The demon, to Judas, was in fact an angel sent by the King of Life to help him complete his Dogs\u2019 training. <br/><br/>Accomplishments are my weakest skill in running Dogs. I always have difficulty grappling with how to frame and resolve these conflicts.<br/><br/>David wanted his accomplishment to be making it through his training without resorting to violence. I started off talking about how the Dog\u2019s instructors made him accompany missionaries into the mining camps to deliver supplies and clothing to the needy. My Raise was a drunken miner striking a prostitute after she, with child on hip, begged him for money. I didn\u2019t say that the child was the miner\u2019s, but that was what I had in mind. I described the women and child flying backwards, blooded and weeping.<br/><br/>David Sees and Raises, just talking, trying to calm the miner. I Raised with the miner pulling a pistol and aiming first at David, and then at the woman and the child, slurring insults at the young Dog prot\xe9g\xe9. David Raised again by pulling the gun back on himself, and that was it, I Gave. David added the Trait \u201cViolence is never the solution.\u201d<br/><br/>Jon\u2019s accomplishment was strengthening the bond with his angel during the training. I narrated my Raises as his instructors talking about nothing will serve you in the mission of being a Dog, not guns or coats or books,  but what you have in here (gesturing at my heart). I also used a Raise where one of the final rites was to walk, spiritually cleansed and naked before the King of Life into the scared temple square garden (meaning, you know, without any supernatural accompaniment).  Jon\u2019s See and Raise was about how his \u201cangel\u201d did accompany him past the consecrated wooden archway.  A he passed the threshold, the \u201cangel\u201d noted a small crack in the wood, and hey, wouldn\u2019t taking a splinter of that archway help him in his arduous trials ahead? Jon won, although I can\u2019t recall if the new Trait was anything but \u201cMy bond with my angel was strengthened.\u201d<br/><br/>The Dogs approach Tea Creek, which is a small Faithful settlement in the foothills of the mountains east of Four Bridal Falls. The town is a lumber town and provides a steady supply of timber for the Faithful in the valleys to the west. I announce that Jonas has an aunt in this town, Sister Grace, and that Judas has a cousin, Brother Simon.<br/><br/>It\u2019s still the end of winter, so it\u2019s a big surprise when they see a fruit orchard in full bloom. It\u2019s unnatural. David immediately suspects demons. They decide to talk to the owners of the orchard, and they meet Sister Dana, who is actually Sister Grace\u2019s daughter. Her father is Brother Ishmael, the branch Steward. Jonas is pretty insistent on finding out why the house is supported by demons. Dana isn\u2019t amused, but suggests he bring this up with Grace in town.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Judas notices that a man is trying to sneak his way out of the back of the house. All in all, it looks like an inappropriate rendezvous between this man, Brother Obadiah and Sister Grace. Obadiah is married, but not to Dana. Judas lets him go after he promises not to continue to see Dana.<br/><br/>They and Dana head into town and everyone is out as if for a party! Yay! The Dogs are here! Everyone is happy to see them, to get mail, and to feed the Dogs. <br/><br/>They meet Grace and her husband, Brother Ishmael, who is clearly the victim of a stroke and is not responsive. Yet, everyone still refers to Ishmael as the Steward.<br/><br/>David went for the jugular \u2013 Jonas accuses his aunt in front of everyone of consorting with demons! I sort of freaked out and panicked. I was really afraid of a big stakes conflict, so Grace pushed to have the conversation in private as opposed to public. I should have gone toe to toe with Jonas, pulling in every NPC I had, and smashed him. <br/><br/>Grace does win, and they talk in private. David doesn\u2019t push right away for another conflict, but he kept a d6 for a follow-up conflict. David doesn\u2019t think he can win, or that Grace isn\u2019t the epicenter. Sister Grace claims to be an \u201cordained oracle\u201d of the King of Life, and in earnest prayer she can determine the will of her husband, as the King of Life speaks to her. She also admits to corresponding with regional officials on behalf of her husband.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119183/#Comment_119183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T20:22:31+00:00" title="January 11, 2008  8:22PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2008 8:23PM by James Jeffers.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judas meets his cousin, Brother Simon, who begs Judas to \u201cpurge\u201d the town and doesn\u2019t elaborate in front of Sister Grace. At his point I draw out the relationship map for the players, as we have lots of names and Brother This and Sister That going on.<br/>There\u2019s Ishmael and Grace, their children Dana (17) and Robert (15), then the other oracle, Susan and her husband Obadiah (the same one who Judas caught at Grace\u2019s house) and their four children (all 5 years or younger), then the last oracle Adelia and her husband Franklin, who have no children yet.<br/><br/>We sort of stalled here, as I think David and Jon didn\u2019t know quite know where to go or who to talk to. And I think that was my fault for being too retentive about the town. I think I should have made is more clear about who thought who was doing what wrong, and so on.<br/><br/>Also, I tried to have Judas\u2019 angel speak up whenever I could, echoing the desires of the demons in the town. That was fun!<br/><br/>The Dogs scout the town, and see that 3 households have fruit trees in bloom, animals birthing early, etc. They decide to go speak with Adelia first. When they arrive at her house, Franklin and Obadiah are on the front porch while farmhands are cleaning up for the end of the day. <br/><br/>Franklin decides that enough is enough, and he\u2019s not going to let these 2 kids push his wife around. The confrontation goes physical with Franklin swinging a shovel at Judas, who defends himself with his book of life. Franklin gives and agrees that what his wife is part of is not right. <br/><br/>Oh my god, this was the best part: when the Dogs walk through the front door to confront Adelia, she\u2019s waiting with a shotgun and her daddy\u2019s pistols. She\u2019s a daughter of a former Dog (that was a 2d20 Trait) \u2013 she knows what\u2019s up. The Dogs See and Raise as they can, but end up shot up, taking multiple d10 fallout dice. David sticks by his non-violent character traits, and only threatens to shoot Adelia. David narrates Franklin taking a bullet. Of course, Adelia is busy stabbing Judas, but the conflict is over: I Give and so Adelia does not kill the Dogs outright. While they go down each with 17 and 16 Fallout totals.<br/><br/>In all the times I have run Dogs in the Vineyard, I never had any NPC attempt to murder the Dogs. But after that conflict, I\u2019m going to try more often. It was so much fun!<br/><br/>Had some questions about medical fallout, but Vincent answered our questions later in the week. Brother Simon ends up taking care of the shot and stabbed dogs and that\u2019s where we left things. <br/><br/>Overall, each conflict had lots of dice being thrown down \u2013 mostly d6s by the players, with a few d8s, since they generally did not want to push things into violence.<br/><br/>Because David and Jon early on decided that demonic attacks were in play, and then shortly after that false doctrine, false priesthood, and sorcery, I had about 4d10s in Demonic Influence. These provided some heavy Raises \u2013 like Adelia\u2019s first Raise was an 18 (10 + 8 on 2 d10s), which I narrated as her emptying both barrels on a shotgun at them.<br/><br/>Overall, I noticed that I tend to do the same thing for each RPG I run. At first, I\u2019m very nervous, to the point nausea. I know I\u2019m going to screw up or that the players will just sit there and stare at me. Then, we start to play and I start to really enjoy it more and more. Dogs In the Vineyard makes it very easy to run. The rules tell you to NOT plan for how things will work out, which in turn eliminates one of the most painful parts of preparing for a game: all the damned planning.<br/><br/>Once the town has a progression of awful and you know what the NPCs and the demons want, it\u2019s just easy to let things go and enjoy the ride. <br/><br/>Also, David and Jon were super-cool and easy going and didn\u2019t get upset when I got rules wrong or had to look up some stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119465/#Comment_119465" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T12:33:36+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 12:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the ending combat scene was VERY "in your face" (literally, with buckshot). I recall at one point Helping Jon by trying to block a shot (right?). It felt very much like what my guy would do, being uber-pacifist and more than a little bit over-confident in his Dogness and Coat to protect him.<br/><br/>I also dug a scene with my Aunt in which she was railing at me that "you've never had children; you don't know what life is really like!" and I reply, pointing at a patch on my Coat, "isn't this the patch you made for me, to strengthen my protection by and devotion to the King of LIFE?" after which I ripped it off, on the Raise, throwing it at her feet. Mind you, this Coat was described something like "immaculately detailed, with patches and embroidery as complex and luminous as stained glass windows." And here my guy is ripping it up to throw in the face of a family member who's doubting his "authority" to judge. One of my favorite Raises so far, in Dogs play--kind of like tearing clothes to signify that a person is "dead to you."<br/><br/>And it's going to be a fun follow-up session, as my Dog now wants the madwoman dead, but has to figure out how to get her to kill herself or get Judas (Jon) to do it. Or, hmmm... is a noose a "weapon?" Is hanging someone who is obviously guilty "violence?" Or, hell... is there anything about my "won't use weapons on a human" and "violence is never the answer" actually *enforced*, or am I just unable to ping them when I am weapon-using or violent? Or maybe I have to try to exorcise the whole town, rather than kill off the perps. Surely, even a pacifist Dog would exorcise a demon, regardless of how one might be able to squint and call such action "violence" against the demon?<br/><br/>Anyhow, it's going well! I can't wait for Jon to show his demon--err, angel--off: it's gonna be a tough battle (for me alone), and my Progidal Son might return home in a coffin.... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119516/#Comment_119516" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T16:07:36+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  4:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be technical, David, your trait is "Violence is never the solution" - it doesn't say anything about violence as a means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
