The game was just starting to get translated into English when Multisim went bankrupt and their assets sold off. Some of those assets ended up in other places (for example, <i>R\xc3\xaave de Dragon</i>), and some I believe are still lost in the mists of time.<br/><br/>At any rate, I think <i>Agone</i> rates as slightly more than a fantasy heartbreaker, as (a) in English it has significant support available, to the tune of four or so sourcebooks/adventures other than the basic rulebook, and (b) in French there is at least the same number of books again.<br/><br/>Agone has lots of quite interesting setting ideas, and the game's theological/magical system is something I haven't seen in any other game (not revolutionary mechanically, but certainly not cut from the same mold as other magical backgrounds).<br/><br/>I'm very sad that Multisim went under, as I would have really liked to see support for <i>Agone</i> continue, and also to eventually see English translations for their other games (especially <i>Guildes El Dorado</i> and <i>Dark Earth</i>).<br/><br/><br/>As for <i>Mechanical Dream</i>, I got a copy of the original hardcover rulebook on a whim, and then traded it in used not six months later. It was full of pretty pictures and strange ideas, but (a) it was obviously written by folks who weren't native English speakers which made the text challenging to read -- not badly written, just not with the "flow" that one might find from a native speaker's writing -- and (b) the game's setting was not at all easy to attach to. I came swiftly to the conclusion that it was not something that was every going to see play in my house, as I just couldn't figure out what players might actually <i>do</i> within the game.<br/><br/>Apparently, Seam Logic (the publisher) also produced a "starter box" supplement for the main rules to get you started playing, and perhaps one or two other books (listed, but I'm not sure they were ever published), that might have assisted in this regard, but those never showed up at my FLGS (and by then, I'd already traded in my rulebook on purchasing something that seemed more likely to see play at my table).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59553/#Comment_59553" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T07:45:13+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  7:45AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought this when it came out.  Please bear in mind that I haven't actually looked at it much since then, so I might be talking total and utter shite.  Also, yes, the English version.<br/><br/>At the time I thought it was a fantastic setting with a pretty uninspiring system.  Actually, IIRC Mechanical Dream has a pretty crappy system.  Character creation involves spending points to buy buy dice to roll your stats or some other crazy thing.  Other things about the system are somewhat crap also.  Interestingly, the book is split in half and has two fronts, one is the "Mechanical" side (rules) and the other is the "Dream" (Setting)<br/><br/>The setting though is totally bonkers in the most glorious way.<br/><br/>First up: There are no humans.  All the races are non-human.  Some are kinda mechanical-but-actually-organic.  All are pretty alien.  All are also humanoid.  Ziin, for example, are the setting's "Great Race" who have better stats than everyone else, but it therefore costs a lot to create a Ziin character and so you always end up with a weak Ziin PC.  Also, the Ziin are rare, because (I kid you not) whenever they see each other they fly into a furious bloodlust and try to kill one another.  Christ knows how thy breed.  Gnath are the most populous race, and are the bulk of the society.  Odwoanes are like lovely hippies who work in factories and don't need to eat, but turn into murderous psychos after dark.<br/><br/>Second, the setting itself: It's set on a planet called Naakinis which is the size of Jupiter.  Most of the surface of Naakinis is covered in a black shadowy wall called The Sofe.  The area of the planet inside the wall is called Ka\xc3\xafnas by it's inhabitants.  Because Naakinis is so unfathomably huge, so is all it's flora and fauna.  Cities are built on a single tree each for example.  Ka\xc3\xafnas has it's own ecosystem at a more human scale that lives alongside the megafauna.  Pretty much the whole of Ka\xc3\xafnas is covered in jungle, and the jungle floor has nasty, enormous things living there.  So the majority of society live in the tree-cities.<br/><br/>Light comes from a thing called The Pendulum which swings back and fourth.  At the ends of it's swing, it's out of sight behind The Sofe and you have a kind of night.  The light from the pendulum drives away the evil madness thing that makes all the bad stuff happen, so when it's dark scary monsters come into existence briefly.<br/><br/>There's a lot more to it, but it's really hard to describe it and not make it sound really crap.  It's much better than I'm making it sound.<br/><br/>The main problem with it is that I can see it being quite hard to get the whole group on the same page.  That is, it's such an odd setting that unless people have read the setting book they probably won't easily get their head around the setting.  It's not like (say) Traveller where you can pretty much sum 90% of it up by saying "it's space opera".  Also, the book was (I think) written in French and published in English.  The translation is charmingly bad at times.  Perfectly readable, but probably not the wording a native English speaker would have chosen.<br/><br/>Does that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59557/#Comment_59557" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T07:56:19+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  7:56AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's got a whole lot of sorta cool artwork in the vein of Tony DiTerlizzi.

Wonderful setting (though too large and complicated for my tastes of play), weird rules (some very random bits, and some very tactical stuff (also, psychological combats are on par with mental ones)), bad english in the core rules (it gets better later on). I bought all the gorgeous books. Every single one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayed it one session as a player. We didn't even start to fathom the depths of the setting. One of those things I'd love to take to another system with a small group of very dedicated players!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played the french version of Agone a few times. Wonderful setting. But play never lived up to the promises of the setting. I played a minotaur character. As Kaare noted, PCs are supposed to be seasoned. My GM had to fudge the dice to prevent a mountain lion not to hand me my bull-ass.<br/>\nThe world tries to be very poetic, but nearly 70 pages of the core book are devoted to combat: equipment list, detailed rules for reach, speed, wounds, etc.<br/>\nThe adventures proposed are very "hey guys, check out the setting: look at this! and this! meet this great NPC! you can interact with him only when his script is fully played out (and you'll want to kill him at that point)", as far as I know.<br/>\nTo give you an idea, I wanted to play a demon summoner. I didn't once summon a critter in three sessions. Then I read Sorcerer and went: OMG! we should totally play in Agone's setting with those rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59743/#Comment_59743" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T15:19:12+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  3:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<code>psychological combats are on par with mental ones</code><br><br>Is that line a typo?

IIRC, you could outright stun enemies in this way. Some "classes" are very good for this kind of combat, and I'm pretty sure it's possible to kill another character in this way. At least, from my reading it's a very good idea to have a character specialized in psychological warfare to soften up enemies, since any kind of wound will weaken a character for the rest of the confrontation.<br/>\nInterestingly, for each physical stat, there is exactly the same stat with the term "mental" in front. "Mental strength, mental agility, etc." Apart from that there are a few social traits, which do not bear this analogy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also rules about how to penetrate sombody's mind. If for example the patient is willing, you could set the scene based on metaphors for his mental illness, populating it with monsters the doctor would have to fight (with his mental stats) to cure the patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings like that.

I suppose its a pretty common-sense approach to adding an additional arena of conflcit to the game while using the same basic rules, but one i've never seen before! Usually, mental and social are just equated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61206/#Comment_61206" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-15T10:31:51+00:00" title="March 15, 2007 10:31AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd pretty much echo what Viktor said.<br><br>Both Agone and Mechanical Dream contain some wild and interesting ideas, which is why I've bought both, but I've never got round to using them (and sold MD). Both have issues of translation, particularly MD. Agone is frustrating in mentioning stuff like the manatee city mentioned above and then not fleshing it out. (Not in the 4 or so supplements that came out in English anyway, though it does feature in a fiction piece. Broadly, a character goes into hibernation in a mausoleum gallery *inside a tooth*.) Agone also seems to have a Cthulhu-like spiral of destruction as you gradually acquire the taint of corruption from dealings with minions of the Masque, the big bad in the setting. I'd describe it as baroque fantasy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
