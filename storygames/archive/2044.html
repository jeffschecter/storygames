                    So, I was gonna bitch about this thing's sister thread on RPGnet, but, why?<br/>
<br/>
I'm hacking Agon to make a Norse thing. I'm looking for mechanical thinking; do these weapons and mechanics make sense? Do they seem to be too much better than the comparable Greek mechanics? Etc.<br/>
<br/>
I examined the weapons and made some adjustments to them; it's my hope that the following should be comparable to them. Are they?<br/>
<br/>
<b>New Weaponry for Ragnarok</b><br/>
<br/>
Some weapons provide two dice. For all those weapons, put both dice in the hand that is using that weapon. One of these dice may be moved to the other hand. You may decide to combine or split these dice at any time before you roll.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Brawling</b>—2d8—Range 0<br/>
You can brawl with one hand or two. If you are using brawling, the <i>only</i> weapon you can use in your left hand is brawling.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Broad Axe</b>—1d8 1d4—Range 1<br/>
You hold a broad axe in one hand.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Great Sword</b>—2d6—Range 1-2<br/>
You hold a great sword in your <i>right</i> hand.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Throwing Axe</b>—Identical to the Greek javelin.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Longbow</b>—Identical to the Greek bow.<br/>
<br/>
In Ragnarok there is no shield. (It occurred to me that it is strictly inferior to defence via brawling.)                </div>

<p>Well, the weapons are (I hope) such that they work with Agon weapons too, but I don't want a confusing profusion of them. I don't want a kabillion skills, either. I really just want axes and more badass swords. Which is to say, I am less interested about talking about <em>what weapons to include</em> than I am about <em>the specific implementation of particular weapons.</em> It's mechanical, not creative, input that I am after.</p>
<p>And if anyone has experience with altering the weaponry, I'd love to hear that.</p>

I think part of the problem you had on RPG.net was that people hear you say "Norse thing" and they think of, well ... <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/lit/epics/TheStoryofBurntNjal/chap83.html" rel="nofollow">this sort of stuff:</a><br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Then the Vikings shot at them and the fight began, and the chapmen guard themselves well. Snowcolf sprang aboard and at Olaf, and thrust his spear through his body, but Grim thrust at Snowcolf with his spear, and so stoutly, that he fell overboard. Then Helgi turned to meet Grim, and they two drove down all the Vikings as they tried to board, and Njal's sons were ever where there was most need. Then the Vikings called out to the chapmen and bade them give up, but they said they would never yield. Just then some one looked seaward, and there they see ships coming from the south round the Ness, and they were not fewer than ten, and they row hard and steer thitherwards. Along their sides were shield on shield, but on that ship that came first stood a man by the mast, who was clad in a silken kirtle, and had a gilded helm, and his hair was both fair and thick; that man had a spear inlaid with gold in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
He asked, "Who have here such an uneven game?"</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
... which seems pretty archetypal, given my (admittedly limited) reading experience of Norse stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanically, I think the Broad Axe is pretty pud -- that d4 is just sitting around to suck.  Moreover, I'm not quite clear what the goal you have for these weapons is -- if we're just talking <i>purely mechanically</i> then what is "wrong" with the given Agon weapons that you want to change?  'Cause all the names and descriptions are just chrome, right?                        </div>

<p>Robert, I want them to <em>feel different</em> physically, so they should have physically different dice and range than the Greek weaponry do. It's about making the experiences different, and it widens your options when you have (bizarrely) Greek and Norse heroes fighting side-by-side; they can be differentiated at a glance. The Norsemen are much stronger at closer ranges and have lots of two-dice weapons.</p>
<p>Yeah, the broad axe is kinda borked. That's fine - I expect people to use it heavily weighted toward offense.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you are getting at by your quotation. Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>p.s. Thanks for asking questions. I really, really appreciate it.</p>

I guess I included the quote to demonstrate why (I think) posters on RPG.net were getting bent out of shape:  Spear and shield combat seems pretty quintessential to a lot of viking sagas and tales.  So telling people you're going to "norse it up" by getting rid of spears &amp; shields short circuits their brains.<br/>
<br/>
Your weapons ideas aren't bad, and I get the idea to make them different.  Something I'd be interested in seeing might be ideas about attack maneuvers which change positioning -- both the idea of a "rush/push" which does damage but also pushes opponents back, and some kind of "grab/hook" which draws them closer.  I could imagine linking shields --&gt; push and spears --&gt; grab, but you could do it with other weapons, eg. the axe could have a "hooking" component.<br/>
<br/>
Despite having run a bunch of trial Agon combats, I don't think I have the Actual Play chops to comment on specific numbers.  From what I do know, the rest of your numbers look okay in that you have tried (I gather) to offset numbers vs the difficulty of closing, right?                        </div>

<p>I like your idea about attack maneuvers, abstractly.</p>
<p>But I don't want to weigh down the system, y'know?</p>
<p>I guess you are making a reasonable point regarding spears and shields; I'll have to work out a way to include them without creating some stupid excess of different weapon abilities. Ideas?</p>

<p>That more or less works. I was also thinking about rearranging the skill <em>layout</em>, and making it a pyramid with Name at the top and Battle at the bottom.</p>
<p>I still pretty much want to dump shields and armour entirely, for selfish reasons - I never remember to use them, so I don't want my adaptation to hinge on them.</p>
