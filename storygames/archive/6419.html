A lot of those members have their own groups who don't really interact.<br/><br/><b>Monthly Meetup:</b><br/>We meet at a pub (the Yellow Griffin) in Toronto to play, they treat us OK and don't charge us anything for the space.  <br/>At that meetup, the most popular games are board and card games with roleplaying elements:<br/>1) Werewolves with RPing<br/>2) Cash and Guns with shit-talking<br/>3) Shadows over Camelot with knightly table-talk.<br/>We also run some demos; I ran In A Wicked Age and TGCHNN, but there's a lot of D&amp;D demos and a few times GMs have held their regular big games of D&amp;D there too.  But if you're having a hard time making your scene work I'd recommend those light, rp-ey boardgames where you can casually meet people, rather than fighting through the veil of roleplaying expectations right from minute 1.<br/><br/><b>GM's Meetup</b><br/>This is another monthly meetup held at a different bar (Scallywag's) in Toronto (<i>Edit: We get about 10-15 GMs out to these</i>).  We always have a topic of conversation that is the launching-off point, but we tend to just trade dice tales and talk about what worked and what didn't.  What I've found best about these is that most of the people who are really dedicated gamers are in fact, GMs most often, so this is another great place to meet new players.  Since we're just a bunch of folks hanging out, we don't need to reserve space, so this meetup is very solid.  <br/><br/><b>Regular games</b><br/>We have about 4 or 5 regular groups whose meetups are posted regularly, but these games are typically full already, and you have to get permission to come.  This represents probably a third of the regular games being run by GMs in this meetup.  That's what I think is the biggest barrier for entry for the meetup - a lot of our wallflowers seem to be waiting for an open slot in a game as their entry point into real, face-to-face communication.  <br/><br/><b>Recent Events</b><br/>We recently renamed ourselves from the (inaccurate, clunky) title of 'York D&amp;D Gamers Meetup' (YD&amp;DMG) to 'Toronto Area Gamers' (TAG).  Two other local groups lost their organizers, so we've had a nominal influx of members from the local boardgame and roleplayers meetups as their accounts expire.<br/><br/><b>Specific things we're doing right</b><br/>1.  Kicking creeps:  We've had to kick a handful of members in our group's 3-year lifetime, and this is crucial.  We're very clear that we're not a place to pick up, that we expect people to respect the host, venue, and other players, that we don't tolerate racism or sexism and that we don't tolerate people following members home and intimidating them.  Sad as it is, warnings don't work for some people - if someone is violating our rules and not apologizing or backing off, somebody has to have the authority to kick them, and the other organizers MUST back up their decision.<br/>2.  Social games at the monthly meetups - instead of playing some serious game, it's really good to mix it up and play with lots of people, laugh, get to know some names.<br/><br/><b>Specific things we're having a hard time with</b><br/>1.  Outgrowing our venues and strapped for cash.  We have a maximum of 25 people for the Yellow Griffin and Scallywags we don't even reserve.  Bars locally want a $500 deposit and from $150 to $300 for a room rental for a day.  We're also not big drinkers so we can't play that card either.  Even at my condo building there's a $200 deposit and $100 to reserve the party room (which therefore goes infuriatingly empty night after night).  <br/>2.  Getting wallflowers out - we have a bunch of people who regularly check the site, are nominally members, change their profiles to indicate they'd love to game, but then remain essentially anonymous and don't ever post in our messageboard.  I've gotten the impression from some of our other new members that they're waiting for a spot to open up in a game they can join, or a new game starting up.  That's a recipe for never finding a game because GMs tend to put feelers out to players they've at least met.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142112/#Comment_142112" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T16:33:12+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  4:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I live in the SF Bay Area and am lucky to have a fantastic FLGS: <a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com/" rel="nofollow">Endgame Oakland</a>.

If they were turned on by the prospect of hanging out with several dozen people they don't already know fairly well, they'd be showing up at your monthly events.  If they were assertive/pushy/extroverted enough to be comfortable about asking to be in a game run by someone they don't know or even to run a game for people they don't know, they'd be doing that.<br/><br/>But they're not.  They're probably interested in gaming (otherwise why even bother checking the site?) but it sounds like they're not interested in the social end of your organization.

We are *very* lucky to have such a forward-thinking FLGS with an amazing gaming area for free.  But not everyone has that.<br/><br/>I wanted to suggest a hybrid approach which I've seen work elsewhere.  When I first moved to the Bay Area, I was playing M: tG and other CCGs and boardgames with folks at a weekly game night at a local pizza place.  It was "sponsored" by the FLGS that was nearby but didn't have any real space for gaming.  But they would supply some freebees and prices for people, and worked to bring people in occasionally to demo and playtest games with us.  It seemed like a win-win relationship for everyone.<br/><br/>But if your local gaming stores aren't so friendly, then that can be a challenge:)<br/><br/>Ryan, your comment about getting the wallflowers out is well taken.  Elliott Wilen started Troupe Berkeley a few years ago to get people together to try different games.  And it's tough because we find the same thing that you do, which is that people join, post their "hi my name is XX and I want to play YY", and then never post again unless someone offers to run something they are interested in.<br/><br/>The only thing that seems to bring out the dead are the quarterly minicons that Chris Hanrahan runs at EndGame.  It's a structured system where GMs sign up to run games in a particular time slot, and people can sign up to play and everything is out in the open.<br/><br/>Perhaps some structure will help bring more of your gamers out?  And you might think about the pizza thing to0.  Many local mom-and-pop pizza places are hurting for dine-in customers, especially on weeknights.  And god knows gamers can go through a lot of pizza and soda:)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142124/#Comment_142124" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T17:48:02+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  5:48PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>How do you support and cultivate your local scene?</blockquote>\nI'm organizing a mini-con in the Triangle area of North Carolina this July.

We've worked hard to grow it over the last year from a few individuals to close to 100 people.. Go Play SE Portland, our monthly game night, has been a big part of that growth. Once a month 10-20 of us get together to play a few different games. GameStorm, our local yearly gaming convention, has also been a big part of it. as has our site, <a href="http://www.goplaypdx.com/" rel="nofollow">Go Play PDX.</a> More then anything, just having about 20 people who are really excited and willing to get other people excited about indie games has really helped.

We have around 40 die hard members, run bi-weekly events that attract 20-30 people, quarterly events that attract 80-100 people, and an overall active base of 150 people with many more inactive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf NerdNYC was a boardgame, when it works, it looks like this...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Appoint leaders<br/>\n- Distribute responsibilities (so no one is overwhelmed)<br/>\n- Create plan (or update)<br/>\n- Create brand (or update)<br/>\n- Create website (or update)<br/>\n- Raise resources (donations or sponsorships)<br/>\n- Buy promo materials (cards &amp; shirts)<br/>\n- Find nerd events (cons, stores)<br/>\n- Promote brand (run booth, seminars, &amp; games)<br/>\n- Identify new friendly nerds<br/>\n- Direct to website (cards)<br/>\n- Maintain new friendly nerds' interest and kill time between events (goof off on website)<br/>\n- Find event space<br/>\n- Find event organizers<br/>\n- Find sponsors<br/>\n- Announce events via website<br/>\n- Run game events (rpgs, boardgames: play games, make friends)<br/>\n- Run social events (picnics, paintball, movies: make friends, play games)<br/>\n- Build social network (new friendly nerds form their own sub groups)<br/>\n- Maintain social network<br/>\n- Debriefing (what can we improve or change)<br/>\n- Repeat cycle<br/>\n<br/>\nWe've been in a bit of a lag and my life has been in utter turmoil the last 6-7 months. But we are running a 1 day event at the upcoming Big Apple Comic Con, are restructuring our leadership team, revamping the website and more in the coming 4 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur biggest problem is that it is easy to find space for 30 or 100 people. Finding space for 150 people becomes very, very hard in nyc. Keeping motivated leaders is a challenge. Running booths at cons becomes hellish after a while. We were IPR at cons for 1-2 years before IPR was formed. And it burned out the people involved. Yet that was one of the best ways to attract more people. Selling shirts was also great in building comradery. But tracking stock was a pain. There are better options now that need to be readdressed. It also becomes very difficult to host a movie night when you have grown past 30 people. Also, the more successful in some ways, the more people break off into their own sub groups. Some people are very excited to form a community when they want to make friends but once they make those friends people tend to settle down. Our age demographics range from 18-60 with the core between 28-36 and many leaders drawn from that core. Another problem is people running out of time having families at that age and working jobs that demand hours between 50-70 hours a week. Definitely a huge challenge. Lots of work for a non profit enterprise (especially in nyc when you can use as much money as possible). But when you see everyone gathered in a room together having fun... it's awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm hoping in the summer to run 1-shots in public stores for non nerdnyc members to recruit and help people form their own gaming groups. As well as running more seminars at cons such as women in gaming, mature themes in gaming, expanding gaming communities, and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wish I wasn't as busy so I can do more. I work 60 hours a week easily, run several companies, and travel all over the world on a sometimes monthly basis. Plus we're couch surfing while our place is under serious construction. But I need more gaming! Hahahahaha. We have so many amazing people living in NY!<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Torquemada" title="Torquemada"><img alt="Torquemada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Torquemada">Torquemada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143330/#Comment_143330" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T13:31:11+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  1:31PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>If NerdNYC was a boardgame, when it works, it looks like this...</blockquote>\nNice set of instructions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br><i>* yoinked *</i> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143332/#Comment_143332" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T13:41:28+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  1:41PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Torquemada</cite><i>* yoinked *</i></blockquote>Ditto for Toronto.

That's what we do at the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Milton Keynes RPG club</a> and we're going from strength to strength.  We've got about 22 regular members who attend each week, with another dozen or so who've come at one point or another but are now on hiatus.  Not bad for a city of only 250,000 people.  <br><br>We meet on Tuesday evenings, 8.00pm - 11.00pm in a local community centre.  We've currently got five separate games on: Earthdawn, Dictionary of Mu, Dark Heresy, Blood Rose Circle, and a Story Games Smorgasbord.  <br><br>When we started the club, we took the view that one benefit of having a large pool of players was the ability to have variety in the games played and the people you're playing with.  To help that, we organise our time into 8-week mini-campaigns interleaved with three weeks of one-off games.  If people want longer campaigns, they just do it over more than one eight-week block.  During the three week block, GMs propose games for the next long block and we all vote for what we want to play.  <br><br>We also organise the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6034" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow mini-con</a> twice a year.  That's converted a few attendees into members, but not many to be honest.  <br><br>Our biggest avenue for new members is the website: it's now the top result on Google for variants on the 'milton keynes rpg' search term.  People keep noticing the site and popping along to the club.  Plonking links to the club on all the website we can think of certainly helps.  <br><br>Hope this helps.  Ask if you want to know more about how we operate.  <br><br>Neil.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143385/#Comment_143385" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-10T06:56:26+00:00" title="May 10, 2008  6:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome work to everyone else.<br>\nI do little personally to support the local gaming here.
