We had fun with it, but also found it tough to get into. We struggled quite a bit with trying to describe action dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the problem was the theme. We mostly picked the Beast Hunters demo because it was something for 2 players we could try for free, but neither of us really has much interest in tribal warriors, melee combat, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue, I think, is that our storytelling skills are pretty weak. We're out of practice--we've become boardgamers who aren't used to thinking in narrative ways when we sit down to play a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few ideas on what to try next:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Play a different rpg. Mars Colony looks interesting. Other 2-player suggestions? 3-player suggestions? <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Play boardgames with significant story elements like Tales of the Arabian Nights. Any recommendations in this category?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Inject extra narrative into games. For example, we've recently been playing the card game Court of the Medici. All the game's thematic aspects are purely "flavor" applied to a numeric strategy game, but it's not hard to see the opportunity for little story fragments as the various characters form alliances and conspiracies against each other. Anybody tried this sort of thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeem like good ideas? What other advice would you seasoned roleplayers/storytellers offer?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309263/#Comment_309263" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T21:24:03+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  9:24PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In about a month or two I would recommend <a href="http://www.seedrpg.com" rel="nofollow">my own game</a><br/><br/>but that is not quite here yet<br/><br/>Until then, i would recommend Apocalypse World if your ok with mature content.

I didn't know AW could do that well.<br/><br/>I haven't played Mars Colony yet (I'd love to hear more from people who have), but I would suggest finding a good RPG that you might like, "storygamey" or otherwise, and inject that story stuff into it. Like a light action game ala Savage Worlds, or crunchier game (World of Darkness?) or whatever.<br/><br/>There are other few-player games that work well, Breaking the Ice is a game about dating, but it is FUN AS HELL, and a great game for two people.<br/><br/>I've heard great things about "S/LAY WITH ME", but haven't played it myself.<br/><br/>Oh, and dude, don't feel bad re Beast Hunters. Pardon the pun, but that game can be a BEAST. I like it, and have played it about 5 times (including once hacked to run a table of like 10 people), but you can get into a real rut of finding new ways to say "I hit it" over and over again.<br/><br/>Brand Robbins played with his wife a lot, and he had success with it basically from the GM awarding HEAPS of those points-for-narration for every action. Not 1 here 3 there, but 5-10 standard, in order to push things along. This makes the two of you more willing to keep some things out of the rules and simply act them out, as well as to get around the whole "this combat has been going on for '20 rounds', and I've long since run out of ways to describe stabbing this monster with my spear" thing. Maybe try heaping on situational points like that.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309266/#Comment_309266" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T21:55:49+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  9:55PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and welcome back to the world of RPGs!

This is more of a "baby step", though, most likely, unless you really hack the narration part. Gloom suggests some narration as part of the game, but it is all one-sided. One thing you can add is that each other player gets to ask you a question about the story you are spinning on your turn, which you have to make up an answer for. Another method is a requirement that every story someone spins must reference a visible card in someone else's hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309287/#Comment_309287" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T05:44:37+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  5:44AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David,<br/>that's funny, right now I'm experiencing the exact opposite situation, I've turned my attention from RPGs to boardgames.<br/>Anyways, I don't think there's much you can do with narration. You just have to get used to it, and the best way is to play games that spur such imagination. Mars Colony is absolutely recommended, but don't think that it has less narration than Beast Hunters. It may even be more difficult, because you'll have to create and keep in mind the status of intense political situations.<br/>Another recommendation would be Ron Edward's s/lay w/me. Also, I'm currently developing a game that is going to work pretty well in 2 players games. But it's still in betatesting, and I'm not satisfied with how it works yet.<br/>Best<br/>Suna                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309297/#Comment_309297" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T06:57:46+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  6:57AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 6:58AM by mease19.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had good luck so far with play-by-forum and play-by-email games.

I find that it can help to have as much time as you need to craft the narration and dialogue.  Don't shoot for a long game, just do one-offs or short story arcs (though I find I can usually participate in 1-3 different games at the same time).

A secondary mechanic determines when the story ends.<br/><br/>Here's a draft of the game on <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dct676c8_142fk56pjc9" rel="nofollow">Google Docs</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309315/#Comment_309315" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T08:43:50+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  8:43AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me pitch my game-in-development <i>Showdown</i>.

The story is that a group a teenages have come aboard a ghost ship to try and steal gold on it. Meanwhile the ghost are out to make them pay for their greed. The narration is structured by the player picking a victory point to go for each turn. You pick a victory point and then narrate a story around it. A simple die roll lets you know which narrations happen. Plays in less than two hours and is for two to six players. <br/><br/>If you are interested I'll get a copy off to you.

It's got a fair amount of crunch for a story game, which you should be fine with because of your boardgame roots, and all the crunch has a point, makes cool story stuff happen.  I've never played it with just two but I bet it would work great:  it's kind of a 2-player game where the two players rotate through the group anyhow.  <br/><br/>If you prefer vampires to science fiction, then Annalise - still a lot of crunch, still a rotating 2-player game, though it takes longer.<br/><br/>If you want low-crunch, then Archipelago II ... which is free.

I'd recommend reading *Play Unsafe* by Graham Walmsley.<br/><br/>Also, I've found 2-player story gaming is just hard - it's easy to get stuck, that third player somehow is the magic ingredient that keeps things spinning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey" title="VacuumJockey"><img alt="VacuumJockey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey">VacuumJockey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309790/#Comment_309790" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T13:59:58+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  1:59PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming at it from the other end, you could try to play games with a strong tactical element - D&amp;D 3/4 ed, Savage Worlds or that old classic, The Fantasy Trip. Ease yourselves into it, so to speak. See what story emerges, and just go with that.<br/><br/>That said, I agree with jdfristrom that it's hard to play story with just 2 guys. Perhaps you could find some cohorts at the local gameshop?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
