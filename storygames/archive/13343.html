I live in Boston. But as it turns out, I'm part of a similar event: a Nov 22 geek-out event at Word Books in Brooklyn called \u201cOf Wizards and Wookiees: A Panel Discussion on Gaming &amp; Fandom." I thought you all might be interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe event features the author of FANTASY FREAKS AND GAMING GEEKS: An Epic Quest for Reality Among Role Players, Online Gamers, and Other Dwellers of Imaginary Realms (Lyons Press, now out in paperback) -- that's me ---  teaming up with another author, Tony Pacitti, author of MY BEST FRIEND IS A WOOKIEE: One Boy's Journey to Find His Place in the Galaxy (Adams Media), to discuss our coming-of-age tales set against the backdrop of Star Wars and Dungeons &amp; Dragons obsessions.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI will definitely be checking this out and would love to to see some other NYC-area storygamers there!

It's partially a memoir of his youth and adulthood treks through fantasy worlds &amp; games, but largely it's a rumination on the meaning of fantasy, whether it's all escapism, and what the answer to that means for our lives. Funny and meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
