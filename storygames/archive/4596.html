Sex, infidelity, polyamory, you name it. One of the things I'd like to include in the game are alternate takes on scenes. Either to be able to explore better ways people could have handled explosive situations, or else to see just how bad things could really get. Seems like you could get some really juicy scenes this way.<br/><br/>What I'm wondering though, is how to deal with issues this raises about the flow of the story. How do people who use this kind of technique, in live form games or table top rp, deal with the multiple versions of the story that result? I've got some ideas in mind, but I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts and experiences. Would it work just fine, or are there other issues I'm not even seeing yet?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103977/#Comment_103977" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-20T17:58:04+00:00" title="October 20, 2007  5:58PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it would be interesting to have each replay of the scene be the scene as it happened from some character's perspective. Maybe even someone who isn't there. What if the first time things go poorly and then your ex-girlfriend hears about it going that way, even if what actually happened was something else.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103984/#Comment_103984" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-20T19:56:09+00:00" title="October 20, 2007  7:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the first take on the scene was bracketed (either deliberately or through careful listening for good stuff) by phrases that were then repeated in subsequent scenes, providing continuity and a point of divergence and reconnection?<br/><br/>I saw Mikkel do something like this in A Day In The Life, using potent words or phrases uttered by players in character to edit scenes - For example I say "It's just too damn hard", and the GM edits, framing a scene in which a new character begins a scene with those same words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104019/#Comment_104019" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T08:46:04+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  8:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a previous thread about this where I went crazy with a bunch of inconsistent narration minigames that could be easily repeated:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3005" rel="nofollow">Fiction of Objectivity</a><br/><br/>I agree that keeping specific elements the same is the key to doing this properly, whether it is a line, a prop, a setting, a challenge, or so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104035/#Comment_104035" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T11:49:53+00:00" title="October 21, 2007 11:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like you're looking for a game that enables you to explore alternatives in a number of different ways. I'm going to work on that assumption.<br/><br/>The way you frame alternatives mechanically will impact what you end up exploring. Romance and erotic fiction can be rich explorations of the myriad ways in which forces like love, affection, consent, anger, jealousy and so on can be configured between two or more people.<br/><br/>I'm going to walk through Breaking the Ice and make some comments and suggestions.<br/><br/><b>Genre</b> could put some limits on what we can explore. Let's say our Genre is "fantasy in a D&amp;D world". This could mean interspecies love. It might mean the breach of trust when a sorcerer uses charm person to try and "fix" her relationship. If it's "romance novel", that implies an exploration of passion as defined within that genre. A game set in the deep south will explore homosexuality differently than one set in San Francisco.<br/><br/><b>Rating</b> might be problemation in some cases. How does Hollywood rate a story about polyamory? I'm not sure Hollywood really knows.<br/><br/><b>Characters</b>: are we free to explore differences in character? I want to play this scene where you're NOT an agoraphobic, and I wasn't raised Hindu. Is this within the scope of your concept?<br/><br/>I've got to go now, but I'm going to contribute more to this later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
