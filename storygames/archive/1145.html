                            I'll play:<br/>
<br/>
1) Players feel psychologically rewarded by seeing an imaginary number rise as a result of their work, irrespective of whether they are having fun otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
2) Said rewards get even stronger when the imaginary number becomes a real object. Tactility, baby.<br/>
<br/>
3) Anything can be made to seem crucially important through application of simple storytelling techniques. (Oh wait, I learned that from White House press conferences)<br/>
<br/>
4) Tactility + convenience (or, if you prefer, better UI) = profit!!! At least until you destroy your organized play program with jackassery<br/>
<br/>
5) A certain segment of the population will always be looking for ways to feel victimized, and thus will take an artistic decision you made for yourself and claim that you made it to send some sort of insulting message to them.                        </div>

The ability to play a game when it is convenient for you, regardless of the availability of people you know, is important.  I.E. if you can only play at 3am, you will find like-minded individuals to team with (the benefit of world-wide player networks).<br/>
<blockquote>2)  What is the best thing we can learn from CCGs?</blockquote>
Brevity and portability. The best CCGs are the ones that can be played quickly and without a lot of pieces/parts to carry around.<br/>
<blockquote>3)  What is the best thing we can learn from Reality Television?</blockquote>
People like escapism, even if it is stupid?<br/>
<blockquote>4) What is the best thing we can learn from Collectible Miniatures Games (a.k.a. Clicky Figs)?</blockquote>@ sold more packs to people "because the little ships look cool and are fun to put together" than because it was a good game.<br/>

I've got nothing. Arrogance?                        </div>

<strong>MMORPGs</strong>  There need be no functional difference between "melee combat" and "magic" and "ranged combat" and "support" roles; everything can work at the same time with similar mechanics.  The mage/warrior distinction built into the old-school RPGs can get ripped right the hell out.  They don't need different rules.<br/><br/><strong>CCGs</strong>  Game rules printed on manipulable items makes games quick, easy, and extensible.<br/><br/><strong>Reality Television</strong>  Anything can be made interesting by putting a human face on it -- <em>King of Cars</em> is about a freaking car dealership.  Jason, I'm still waiting for <em>Copy Repairman: the Xeroxing</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Collectible Miniatures Games</strong>  Uh... toys are fun?<br/><br/><strong>Fine Arts</strong>  A critical eye can help us develop our hobby/genre/avocation in new and interesting ways; things may be rocky at first, but there are insights to be gained from the most fumbling first steps forward.                        </div>

                            Okay. Here are my thoughts. I held them to give others a chance to answer.<br/>
<br/>
1) What is the best thing we can learn from MMORPGs?<br/>
<br/>
My opinion:  Short term goals requiring group cooperation to attain personal development goals.<br/>
<br/>
2) What is the best thing we can learn from CCGs?<br/>
<br/>
My opinion:  Flavor Text (I know it's been done, but people seem inordinately fascinated with quips.)<br/>
<br/>
3) What is the best thing we can learn from Reality Television?<br/>
<br/>
My opinion: Character investment.  In what is traditionally a passive medium (television), a great deal of attachment and investment from viewers go into their favorite and least favorite participants. <br/>
<br/>
4) What is the best thing we can learn from Collectible Miniatures Games (a.k.a. Clicky Figs)?<br/>
<br/>
My opinion:  Overall packaging/merchandising.  (Generating tactile appeal, with expandable rule sets, collectibility)<br/>
<br/>
5) What is the best thing we can learn from the Fine Arts?  Self-expression of style and form in our chosen medium.<br/>
<br/>
....<br/>
I'd also be tempted to add: 6)  What can we learn from Soap Operas?  My opinion:  Drama trumps logic.                        </div>

                            1) MMORPG's:<br/>
Along with what other people have said what can we learn from MMORPG's: That people don't necessarily want to play a role, so much as reap a sense of accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
2) CCG's:<br/>
Art can divide people's opinions. Quick two player drop and play may be a possible avenue to explore for more RPG's.<br/>
<br/>
3)Reality Television:<br/>
<br/>
Not having  (script) control over the behaviour of participents may be boring as heck to some people.<br/>
<br/>
4) CMG's:<br/>
That people like toys.<br/>
<br/>
5) Fine Arts<br/>
Games are visions to an individual and they bring with them as much of what goes in their response as they absorb from the art/game/object.                        </div>

Party up!, for alot of MMORPG's its more fun if its more people. <br/>
<br/>
2) CCG's:<br/>
Quick, Easy to learn. Pretty art. And for me at least, thinking slightly outside the box, getting the rules to do clever things. <br/>
<br/>
3)Reality Television:<br/>
<br/>
uhhh, just because its popular doesnt mean it has any quality? Too much is bad. Some people seem to like watching people bitch and whine for 42 out of a 44 minute show? <br/>
<br/>
4) CMG's:<br/>
Same as CCG's but prettier. <br/>

Exploring a world of possibilities is engaging by itself.
<blockquote>2) What is the best thing we can learn from CCGs?</blockquote>
With a limited set of options in random combination you can create massive possibilities.
<blockquote>3) What is the best thing we can learn from Reality Television?</blockquote>
Nobody ever went broke appealing to the lowest common denominator? <br/><br/>No, I'll go with: Feeling as if you can have an effect, however small, creates engagement disproportionate to the quality of the material. Even if people don't exercise the opportunity to have the effect.
<blockquote>4) What is the best thing we can learn from Collectible Miniatures Games (a.k.a. Clicky Figs)?</blockquote>
Some people are engaged by physical artefacts in a way that they are not engaged by words alone.
<blockquote>5) What is the best thing we can learn from the Fine Arts?</blockquote>
Not to take ourselves too seriously and vanish up our own orifices.                        </div>

<blockquote>1) What is the best thing we can learn from MMORPGs?</blockquote>
Agreed on the "a game so fast it can be thrown down any time". MMOs are played by people tired when they come home from work. RPGs can benefit from that level of thought.<br/><br/>Also echoing "immersion into a visual world you couldn't create" (ex: the buildings, scenery etc of the more lush games).
<blockquote>2)  What is the best thing we can learn from CCGs?</blockquote>
Not just abilities, but abilities that stack on each other. If you're going for the gamist game.<br/><br/>Also, a game you can pull out, run with a few others, then put away after a few hours.
<blockquote>3)  What is the best thing we can learn from Reality Television?</blockquote>
...<br/><br/>Pass!
<blockquote>4) What is the best thing we can learn from Collectible Miniatures Games (a.k.a. Clicky Figs)?</blockquote>
Same as above for CCGs.<br/><br/>Also, collectible + RPG = FAIL.  (see "Everway")
<blockquote>5) What is the best thing we can learn from the Fine Arts?</blockquote>

                            This is a very interesting thread. a great question, one we should all really examine as designers.<br/><br/>1. Players are interested in community. They like to hang out half in and out of game. They like dealing with reource economies. They will participate activly in meta plot regaurdless of whether the game supports it or not (message boards and such). Interface is brutally important.<br/><br/>2. Simplify simplify simplify. Magic is popular because it can be a quick and easy game. Serious players like looking at and comparing stats much like MLB fans. Portability, or the ability to play a pick up game is sought after.<br/><br/>3. People are most interested in other people. They like to watch others and relate that information to themselves. Be it fictional or otherwise we characterize anything we see in media, and relate it to ourselves. We are fiercly personal. We are driven by a desire for a "better" societal groups.<br/><br/>4. Collectability can sell just as many units as playabilty, and the two need not be linked. Again, interface you swine, what you do to play the game is super important. A tactilly and visually pleasing item is desired by players (this should also be in question 1).<br/><br/>5. The audience fetishises the product. "Hands off, because this is important" can be manufactured artificially and yeilds interesting results when dissobeyed. Artifice facinates. Differant people look at the same thing differantly. What you take away from an object is not nesisarily what was put in. Know your audience.                        </div>

                            1) What is the best thing we can learn from MMORPGs?<br/>
<br/>
More people are interested in "Roleplaying" and even "Traditional Genre Roleplaying (D&amp;D)" than actually play Roleplaying games (including D&amp;D).  This should be a serious wake-up call to the RPG industry / hobby.  Time for thinking about <i>why</i> the average person wouldn't play an RPG, but would play WoW.<br/>
<br/>
* Don't have to organize a group of people to meet in the same physical place<br/>
* Can be played whenever it's conventient<br/>
* No prep work require of any Dungeon Master<br/>
* No (or minimal) requirement to learn the rules of the game<br/>
* No social stigma about playing video games (or at least much less than RPGs)<br/>
* Easy to buy in the mall, install on your computer and get playing right away<br/>
<br/>
2) What is the best thing we can learn from CCGs?<br/>
<br/>
* The Game part of RPG and competitive play often gets overlooked.<br/>
* The rules are often much tighter, and don't require a Dungeon Master / Referee<br/>
* Artwork is appreciated, if it shows up as part of the game (instead of just in the rulebook) it is appreciated, and can build a sense of immersion<br/>
<br/>
3) What is the best thing we can learn from Reality Television?<br/>
<br/>
* There is no starring character in a Reality Television show (not like a book, movie, etc)<br/>
* People are aware that there isn't a single path through the game/story to victory.<br/>
* The interaction between the people is more interesting that the overall narrative of the game.<br/>
<br/>
4) What is the best thing we can learn from Collectible Miniatures Games (a.k.a. Clicky Figs)?<br/>
<br/>
* Just like CCGs...<br/>
* Artwork is appreciated, if it shows up as part of the game (instead of just in the rulebook) it is appreciated, and can build a sense of immersion<br/>
* Not everyone who would have miniatures in their game is interested in the parallel hobby of painting miniatures<br/>
<br/>
5) What is the best thing we can learn from the Fine Arts?<br/>
<br/>
* Originality is appreciated<br/>
* Skillful execution is appreciated<br/>
* Learn from the classics                        </div>

There are lots of former tabletop gamers that stilll would like to game, but have limited time to do so. These let those folks connect with a broader community to play at any time. ( I don't play, but I have an old gamer buddy who loves these. He can play when he gets off work at 3 am, whatever day he feels like it).

You can have simple core rules, then break up the rest of the rules into small units that are only used by those interested. You can sell tons of low-cost-per-unit items. Items that reference non-rpg phenomenons ( sports cards) have a mental hook for the greater audience.

People like to stare at trainwrecks.

Adults are embarassed by playing with toys, so they need an excuse.

If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance (the artist), baffle em' with bullsh*t (the sellers).                        </div>

As a side note to this the whole Fantasy Art Card market dried-up shortly after the arrival of M:TG on the shelves. It's like CCGs killed "art fort art's sake cards".                        </div>

                            Okay everyone, here are some brainstorming questions regarding game elements and game design for story games in relation to other entertainment media. Please limit your responses to one item per question.<br>
<br>
As game designers/or players:<br>
<br>
<br>
1) What is the best thing we can learn from MMORPGs?<br>
<br>
Crafting. People can spend hours trying to make their own stuff... and never seem to get bored. It's about homemade rewards. Third edition D&amp;D has attempted to address this phenomena but I think it falls short. I think a good tabletop solution for crafting has yet to be found.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) What is the best thing we can learn from CCGs?<br>
<br>
Stackable Mechanics. The best thing about CCGs is the way a single card can be one thing when regarded alone and another thing entirely when coupled with a partner. Guild Wars is a computer game that tries to adapt this concept to an RPG application. Another computer RPG, Chrono Trigger (SNES) had characters who could utilize special attacks only when they worked together. Stackable Mechanics. These can be a powerful addition to any story game.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) What is the best thing we can learn from Reality Television?<br>
<br>
Immunity Challenges. I haven't watched many Reality TV shows but I am a huge comic book fan and I have been watching "Who Wants to be a Superhero?" it has immunity challenges and I know that Survivor does too and I am sure many others. Story Telling games are not elimination games, so the Immunity Challenge as such won't work. But conceptually the idea is good. Give the players a challenge and reward them for accomplishing this challenge which will give them some special edge that will only be useful in the next (bigger, badder) encounter. It's a model for structuring adventure scenarios that could teach us a lot about motivating players to accomplish a particular goal.<br>
<br>
<br>
4) What is the best thing we can learn from Collectible Miniatures Games (a.k.a. Clicky Figs)?<br>
<br>
Use Miniatures. Miniatures are intrinsic to our hobby. I think the popularity of Miniatures games proves how important the things are to any gaming experience. This gaming model is based upon a CCG marketing concept and has many of the same strengths and weaknesses. So, beyond repeating what was said about Stackable Mechanics (that also exists in the CMG) I just want to emphasize that I feel any story telling game needs to have a mechanic for dealing with miniature figures. People like them.<br>
<br>
<br>
5) What is the best thing we can learn from the Fine Arts?<br>
<br>
Create for Yourself. The best art is a reflection of the artist's soul. As human beings we all have things in common and as such it is entirely possible that your vision will touch someone. Write create and build the game that YOU want to play. This then is your art. The more personal, the more passionate you are about it, the more those people you reach out to who can appreciate your vision will be able to say, "Wow, this really speaks to me."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I don't think that was the primary factor in the failure of Everway, although it may well be in the top ten factors.                        </div>
