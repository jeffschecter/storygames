For example, it's been hashed out a dozen times that yes, a 1st level character can afford a AC 22 armor (leather or equivalent), so everybody can just write that on their sheets if they want it. On the other hand, you don't get AC 25 (chain, etc.) unless there's some fictional positioning involved that would justify it. Lately the players have favoured playing members of Hans Kr\xfcger's (a 5th-level Fighter player character) mercenary company, as he's outfitted his company with mid-range armor, so logically the new player character will also have that <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br>I find that the above method encourages players to respect the fiction from the start. Our style of hardcore gamism relies on everybody truly caring about the fiction, which is why I find it useful to give the players certain freedoms and responsibilities from the start. It gets them used to thinking of the fiction seriously and making positioning decisions without mixing the executive branch (that is, the character's own greed) into it. I've yet to have a player who would interpret "write anything reasonable you think your character should have at the beginning of his adventuring career" as a free hand to put down a horse and plate mail. Wait, no - I did have a guy who wrote down a horse, but it was no big deal to correct it, and he did have the presence of mind to ask about it so I could correct him - because obviously, a horse's a pretty expensive thing, right?<br/><br/>The reason for why we moved onto this method is that buying equipment is slow, and it gets old. The 1st level character doesn't really and truly have an interesting set of options available, and once the other characters have some money to loan him, a low roll on wealth won't be a problem, either. In reality the new character will be getting roughly what he wants off the lower end of material wealth anyway, so there's no reason to waste time with the equipment list. Similar characters will get similar things, which means that it's even further pointless to have the player read the lists again and again. Also, I should emphasize that the equipment list itself is questionable from my viewpoint: players relying on an equipment list for their ideas are not thinking for themselves, and they are sadly limiting themselves to the ideas on the list. Furthermore, it's not like the prices on those lists would hold, from the start our campaign has worked off the assumption that prices change constantly (more realistic, especially as any given static list is going to be hilariously wrong in some aspect): when a player wants to buy something, the GM (or some other player; lately I've subcontracted the haggling) throws out a price off the top of his head, and maybe a bit of haggling ensues if the purchase is so large that it matters.<br/><br/>Interestingly I still have players roll for some spending money on top of their equipment list: 3d6 silver pieces (the default monetary unit) or 2d6 gold (when the character starts in the Imperium) to be held until the game actually starts and they need to pay themselves out of the inn or whatever when they leave for adventure.<br/><br/>All that being said, equipment packages are a definitely competitive method! If I had time for building my own tables, I would go this way. Also, convention games and one-shots, definitely the superior method. One of these days I'm going to do this thing. Maybe make it an alternative to the freeform method we're using: it might be interesting for a player to risk getting a really bad equipment set, or one that includes stuff we don't normally allow for beginning characters.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>In New York Red Box I at least spend so much time having characters die and rolling up new ones that the inspirational value of going over the list and thinking of clever equipment tricks has long ago worn off.

Also, we have a system where players get to retroactively add obvious things into their inventory by rolling Wits checks. A bad failure will indicate that the character actually forgot to take something the player had marked down, while a success means that even if the player forgot totally to take lamp oil, the character had his head on his shoulders. This is a logical outgrowth of the view we have on player-character relations: the player is not his character, he's just the guiding intelligence that provides the character's intent. The character is not going to hilariously underperform himself just because the player is not literally waging his own life and death on the character's antics.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366773/#Comment_366773" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T08:27:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  8:27AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're really introducing new players to that era of D&amp;D, buying equipment and learning how to best use it is part of the process of discovery.

Which doesn't mean you need to do the same thing for your OSR version, but his work may give you something worthwhile to have in mind when thinking about them.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of good stuff there.

But if you're talking about letting the characters wander around the map and discover the variuos encounters (the bandits, the hermit, the lizardmen etc.) then I'm guessing that'll happen eventually, after a few sessions. I'm explicilty stating in my document of principles that this is a sandbox and that they can go anywhere they want (within the confines of the map). The rest of the world we'll build if the need arrises. But it'll all start with choices and dungeons, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Rob, I've downloaded that document some time ago and have looked it briefly. I don't want to get to attached to a specific way of playing out the caves, so I'm not going to read it in detail, but I'll use if and when I feel the need for some additional insights during prep between sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368252/#Comment_368252" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T11:27:50+00:00" title="March 17, 2012 11:27AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Ola">@Ola</a>, I think you got it<br/><br/>I was just saying a sandbox isn't a sandbox unless the players are told it's a sandbox                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368525/#Comment_368525" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T15:11:19+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  3:11PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 3:11PM by Roger.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might like this:<br/><br/><a href="http://redvan.wikidot.com/best-equipment" rel="nofollow">http://redvan.wikidot.com/best-equipment</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369464/#Comment_369464" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T15:20:09+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  3:20PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an excellent breakdown, Roger.

It would affect M-U:s quite a lot, because you need information, so you can prepare the right spell. Heck, I know games where all sorts acrobatics, climbing and stuff are the key to avoiding monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again if the dungeons are pretty straightforward, surprise is something that you can't affect too much, armor doesn't hinder you in other ways except in regard to movement rate, if the turn sequence let's magicians fire their spells without preparation and if sneaking is something you'll resolve with thief skills, it's kinda insane not to use armor. It'll really become stupid if the thief skills are handled so that if you miss your roll, you'll alert the enemy, because the added security that two scouts would give, will make sure that at least someone will miss their check. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read the books both ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370395/#Comment_370395" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T06:04:12+00:00" title="April  1, 2012  6:04AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It will also affect things when you're playing really old skool style and have multiple parties plundering the place on different game nights with different play group composition.<br/><br/><i>Straightforward dungeon</i> is tricky too.<br/><br/>I wish Eliot W was still around here and active.
