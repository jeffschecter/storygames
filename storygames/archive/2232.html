<b>EDIT: See second post: My bad, I don't need a character concept after all</b><br/><br/>Hey all.  This week my weekly gaming group begins our long-term GURPS SF Campaign. (insert picture of an ID card titled "Indie Cred", with my photo, and a red "REVOKED" stamp on it) :-)<br/><br/>Anyway, how we normally handle character generation is this: We all work out together what our character concepts are, some major facts/issues/personality points, then we write them down and the people who own the game books stat those characters out for them.  Beth is a player who has a relaxed attitude about her character, and is totally fine with being handed someone interesting, treating it almost like a theatrical experience. So she doesn't care too much about the nuts and bolts. If there are issues, we usually change the characters around in the first three sessions then let them ride from there.<br/><br/>Problem is, all the other characters are defined, and either statted out or in-process.  Beth's is the only one we're having problems with, particularly because she's not too invested in what she starts off with (since she's totally cool with working with whatever is given her).<br/><br/>So here's what I need help with. We're going to stat up her character tonight, and we want some ideas to throw past her to see what catches her attention.<br/><br/>What she showed interest in sofar is this: "Pilot with language/people skills".  That's it.  From there, I want some 1-3 sentence simple ideas of Personality, Background, stuff like that. When I tried a go at it, all I could think of was "typical brash pilot who also happens to speak a few languages". Boring. <br/><br/>If you have a sec, I'm looking for some interesting ideas in terms of simple personality or background ideas that might bring such a character to life, that isn't obviously based on any particular character in a Joss Whedon production.<br/><br/>The setting is pretty simple: It's like a blend between Firefly and Cowboy Beebop.  There's no "Western" parts (like Firefly) but the social issues of empire/inworld-outworld stuff exists.  From there, pretty much anything goes. Any idea that you contribute can be quickly grounded in the setting, because we're making it up as we go.<br/><br/>So, anyone want a go at turning "Pilot. Good at languages" into something... more? I'm just looking for a sentence or three examples, which we'll run by Beth to figure out which appeals to her the most.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If you're looking for what the other crew members look like, they're over here (but you don't have to read this page to help out)</span><br/>EDIT: Removed link to prevent spambots from scouring it.<br/><br/>Thanks- I'm just looking for some ideas over the next 8 hours or so (as my brain is fried), and will tell you what she picks from there.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            ACK!  I'm really sorry, looks like I jumped the gun.  Alan (the first GM) already has that character covered, and is statting it up right now.  Sorry about the confusion, I don't need ideas after all.<br/><br/>If someone happens to be in the middle of cross-posting, though, I'll find a way to turn your dude into a major NPC. Otherwise, no ideas needed now. Sorry!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            This is a girl who gets around.  Hence the piloting and all.  But she knows somebody in every port, has contacts everywhere, speaks the language, and can do the "disappear into the culture" thing that Indiana Jones <em>says</em> his friend can do in the third movie.  (In GURPS terms, I'm thinking of the Cultural Adaptability trait and a lot of Contacts.)                        </div>

                            Son/Daughter of high ranking empire Starship Captain/ Exec/Pilot. Knows everything about the military ships but couldn't stand the discipline. Lit out for a life of simple adventure but keeps getting caught up in the fact that Organization beats dis-organization which would make Daddy right.                        </div>
