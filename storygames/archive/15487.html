(I'm not generally a television person, nor a zombie person.)<br/><br/>One thing jumped out at me:<br/><br/>This series looks like it could be gamed very well as a Dogs in the Vineyard scenario. All those issues of authority and violence, gender roles, etc, just scream Dogs to me.<br/><br/><br/>(However, that's about the interactions between cast members. You'd probably need to think carefully about what to do if fighting zombies is going to be a part of the game, too. Either you need another, simpler/faster subsystem for that, or you just stick to fighting/guns for zombie conflicts. In this case, escalating to guns presumably is dangerous because it could attract more zombies, making it an interesting choice.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I do like the idea of taking relationship dice with a zombie: we see that a lot in the series, and no one ever seems to get bitten by the zombie of someone they knew, they tend to "win" those conflicts. Relationship dice could model that pretty well, actually, couldn't they?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351202/#Comment_351202" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-11T14:06:27+00:00" title="December 11, 2011  2:06PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2011 2:06PM by J_Walton.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The comics are so much better than the show that it's not even funny, though I had to stop reading the comics after the first few volumes because it got too terrible for me to be willing to continue (graphic violence towards women and children, especially).<br/><br/>Also, Jason Morningstar ran a long-form zombie game with TSOY, as I recall.

My group actually made characters for a high-school-zombie-breakout scenario, and the lifepath character and setting creation was totally amazing-- we had an entire cast of NPCs and list of locations our characters were tied to, all ready for some hell to break loose.

(Also, it's not so great at making zombies an environmental hazard -- at least in my experience.  AFMBE tends to put the zombie menace front-and-center, no matter what flavor of zombie you're using.)<br/><br/>Smallville seems like a decent match to me, though truthfully, you could probably hack just about any damn game to do it.  Zombie stories are very portable that way.<br/><br/><br/>As a side note:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>The comics are so much better than the show that it's not even funny,</blockquote>I'm not so sure about this.  The comics are better in some respects (no budget/location/casting restrictions, etc.), worse in others (no actors to infuse Kirkman's haphazard characterization with genuine, likable personalities), and exactly the same in many ways (both the comics and the show tend to get stuck in long, boring ruts).<br/><br/>It's certainly possible that the comics are better.  "Much better," on the other hand...not really.  It ain't like the awful Dexter novels versus the actually good "Dexter" TV series, that's for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351404/#Comment_351404" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T15:21:46+00:00" title="December 13, 2011  3:21PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in an entirely different TSoY Zombie Apocalypse game than the one that Jason was in and I must concur with his assessment; TSoY is a great engine for playing a Zombie Apocalypse that is about more than just the Zombies.

The Walking Dead is awesome specifically because of the human side of the equation. These are not all (though some are) one-dimensional caricatures, they are as human as you or me. It's their interactions between one another and between groups of survivors that makes the show amazing. Zombies themselves have been done to (un)death.<br/><br/>The zombies are really just the awesome setting for what is otherwise a soap opera for guys. Kind of like Heroes/The 4400 and their whole "special superpowers" shtick: take it away and reveal the lifetime movie beneath.

This isn't just a troll.<br/><br/>Cause I enjoyed, for example, Jericho. Most of the time. But sometimes it was just a little too excessively focused on the who's-sleeping-with-who plots. A little bit of that is fine. But sometimes it gets excessive, when you've completely stopped advancing the "how do we survive after this big event" plotlines in order to completely focus on budding romance and torrid affairs to the exclusion of everything else.<br/><br/>I've watched some of The Walking Dead, but my 9 year old son has a relatively late bed time and my wife has a queasy tummy for anything gross, so I haven't seen nearly as much as I'd like. Also I often use that brief time slot to do things like play Skyrim, which I can start on before the little guy is asleep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351521/#Comment_351521" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T18:19:46+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  6:19PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob,<br/><br/>That's a good point!<br/><br/>I certainly do like the presence of zombies in the show: they provide an interesting catalyst to the existing power dynamics and drama between the characters.<br/><br/>But, just like gratuitous violence or gratuitous "sexy" scenes (or gratuitous melodrama), scaring people with being eaten and images of gruesome dead people sometimes means that the writers/producers are taking an easy way out of creating actual meaningful drama. <br/><br/>I like how the show is developing survival challenges, gender role and power-based conflict given the context of a zombie threat. The actual "fighting with zombies" scenes are OK... but I wouldn't watch the show if that was the main focus. I do like when the subvert the genre in interesting ways, like in the episode where [very slight spoiler, white text follows] <span style="color: #FFFFFF;">the characters are "marching" zombies around by putting loops around their necks, like animal handlers.</span><br/><br/>If it were an RPG, I wouldn't want "fighting zombies" to be a major part of the mechanics of play. Rather a threat, sometimes immediate, sometimes background.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with Jericho! I don't know if I would like it. (I also don't like D&amp;D games that are non-stop combat scenes, for what it's worth.)<br/><br/>In the Dogs metaphor, if Demons were zombies, that would work pretty well for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351525/#Comment_351525" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T19:23:24+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  7:23PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a big difference between things like "we're arguing about our personal drama, but we need to do it quietly because if we scream and yell then the zombies will hear us and attack, so we have this extra pressure going on that's affecting our interaction" and "well, the writers decided to give us this totally safe zone to work with, so now we can scream and yell all we want and the zombies aren't really important anymore".<br/><br/>Does that make sense, as the difference I'm getting at? There's a big difference between having interesting inter-character drama that is affected by the overarching situation of the show, and having character drama that starts to ignore the show's initial setup.<br/><br/>It's great when you have an overarching situation and then you have the inter-character drama, and the character's ability to deal effectively with the overarching situation is complicated by their drama. That's awesome stuff. Love it.<br/><br/>But when you set up an initial situation, and then you stop engaging with that situation and just wallow in relationship drama stuff that stops having anything to do with the initial situation, then you lose that exciting tension and now you just have people being stupid to each other.<br/><br/>For example, I'm finally going through and watching Battlestar Galactica. I won't hide spoilers because I'm pretty sure I'm one of the tiny minority of geeks who is interested in the show and hasn't gotten around to watching it yet. But I'm at the stage after they settled on a planet for a while and now they're off again and looking for Earth supposedly. But the dynamics regarding the initial setup - with the Cylons hunting down the Humans, who then have their own internal problems that make it hard for them to deal with the Cylon threat effectively sometimes - have changed so many times that the tension I was talking about is totally messed up. So now, when I see Starbuck and Apollo going through their marriage/affair/whatever drama, most of the time it's not working for me. It's okay when it's intermingled with the Cylon attack at the Temple of Jupiter, because you have that extra tension thing. But later it's just them mucking around and wallowing in drama cause the Cylons aren't in play.<br/><br/>So just because they aren't fighting zombies doesn't mean that the threat of zombies can't be used to add an extra exciting dimension to the interpersonal conflict.<br/><br/>And now I need to go home and start catching up on the show.<br/><br/>Also - I added the comics to my Xmas list. Thanks for mentioning them on this thread. If I don't get the compendium for Xmas, I'm sure I'll get it for my birthday a month later. That's the upside to a late January birthday - the things that you wanted that you didn't get, you can ask for again, and since people are out of their other creative ideas, they'll get what you request.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351570/#Comment_351570" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T08:51:19+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  8:51AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, the thing about the episodes without zombies is they let you fool yourself into thinking things are normal, that they're safe.

I like this idea, especially with the concepts of long term relationship development play. Its all scacity and no status quo right? No prepared plot, just the obvious front of the walking dead, numerous countdowns and whatever other PC - NPC - PC tensions develop through play. The Dead Weight moves are rather delicious too. Little or no reskinning required.

That's not saying much as I didn't really care for the show up until the last few episodes of Season 2.<br/><br/>I don't know whether it's the script or the acting but I'm not really engaged by the characters as much. Aside from Darryl and Shane, I'm not very curious what happens to them next. The show's made some great creative choices with Shane's character relative to the comic, obviously, and that last episode was dynamite so I'll keep watching.<br/><br/>I revisited the first Walking Dead trade (HC) recently and it's definitely the weakest twelve issues of the series. It got better over time and I find myself amazed by Kirkman's creative energy to keep the whole thing going all these years with few let ups. The courage in his writing and characterization choices too. The show is really just getting started.<br/><br/>One thing about the comics is that Kirkman is a master of the cliffhanger. Picking up the series from the beginning and having to wait a whole month to see what was going to happen next was wonderful and agonizing. You can't really get that from the trades now as you can sit down and read 12 issues straight through.<br/><br/>edit: reading single issues also, for me, kept the horror of the awful things that happen to some of the characters to a level where it did not overwhelm me to the point of not being able to continue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
