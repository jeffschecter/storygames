Due to various factors, some of which are reasonable but which basically boil down to me being disorganised, I didn't send them.<br/><br/>So! If I owe you a PDF of Play Unsafe, then you are probably Arturo, Eric J Boyd, Sean Musgrave or King Turnip. I've just emailed you guys the PDF. <i>However</i>, if it doesn't get through, because of changing email addresses or problems with attachments, get in touch and we'll sort something out. It'd be great if you got them for Christmas.<br/><br/>If you think I owe you a PDF of Play Unsafe, but you are not named Arturo, Eric, Sean or after a vegetable, get in touch.<br/><br/>If you don't think I owe you a PDF, but would like one anyway, then you can get one from the nice blue-haired people at <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16743&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a>.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
