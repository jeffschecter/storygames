In the game, the Morganites are noted for being really, really rich and having a strong taste for luxury.  They're not as tough or as smart as other groups, but they probably have the nicest clubhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thread split, as threads do, into an argument about Ayn Rand* and an actual discussion of the topic at hand, and I came up with this thought:<br/>\n---<br/>\nI think a game set in the Morganite society could be a lot of fun, actually... sort of like Paranoia, but with a tremendous degree of luxury the Alpha Complex doesn't have. Not so much tight ideological control as a constant focus on the bottom line, worry about downsizing, and need to keep up with the latest management fads that have caught the interest of the corner office guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention tank battles.<br/>\n"I think we need to build hovertanks, sir. All the other societies have them already, and they keep flanking us..."<br/>\n"Nonsense. If hovertanks were that important, we'd have invented them ourselves. Now just go out there and fight smarter, not harder."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be like Dilbert with railguns and designer drugs.<br/>\n---<br/>\nMore specifically, like the "corporate noir" novels of Joseph Finder with added cyberpunk, or <u>Market Forces</u> by Richard Morgan.  Maybe the world of <u>Snow Crash</u> fits in there a bit, too.  In gaming terms, I dunno.  Inspectres comes to mind, but you'd have to modify it a fair bit to get from entry-level ghostbusting to corporate warfare.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what system would you use for this sort of game?  How would you make it rock?<br/>\n<br/>\nDanny<br/>\n*Every thread that survives Godwin's law will eventually become an argument about Ayn Rand as post count approaches infinity.  It's a law.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98816/#Comment_98816" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T20:36:16+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  8:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So few games really do decadence and luxury <i>well</i>.

Then again, Cory Doctorow's post-scarcity novel <i>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</i> just introduces a new resource (reputation) which has to be managed - good old primate status instinct. So probably you just need to think about what resource you want to have as the scarce one (I'd suggest status or influence), how its management should look, and then look for a game that manages a resource that way.<br><br>(Scary side note - the spellchecker in Firefox recognizes "Cory Doctorow" as valid words, but not "indie". Nor does it recognize "spellchecker" or indeed "Firefox".)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98824/#Comment_98824" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T21:16:07+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  9:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would suggest office comedies, like, er, The Office.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98826/#Comment_98826" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T21:36:16+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  9:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking more about it.  I'm surprised there isn't a single game that comes to mind; the evil megacorporation is a stock fixture in so much media.<br/>\n<br/>\nDogs in the Vineyard would work.  You'd play the auditors, the inspection team, the hatchet men.  The guys that Weyland-Yutani dispatches in the movie <u>Aliens</u> to find out <i>what the hell</i> is holding up the bioweapons project...  the characters would come to a new facility and get taken out for a nice meal and get a totally bogus powerpoint presentation on how things are going, and then they'd start grilling people and finding out who's sleeping with whom and who's screwed up.  And then heads would roll, figuratively or literally, and on to the next facility.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut.  For one thing, I hate auditors.  For another, there's no mechanism in DitV for reporting back to the head office -- that's the whole point, the Dogs are far from central authority and they're a law unto themselves.  Nor is there any mechanism for accumulating status in the Dog hierarchy by narking on your fellow Dogs or buttering up influential townspeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'd like something with more of an entrepreneurial vibe, with the idea that a lucky and daring character can make it much further than he deserves.  Like salesmen, but with guns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98828/#Comment_98828" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T22:04:28+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:04PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "We had to shoot him in the face, but we closed the contract.
