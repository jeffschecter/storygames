HfL is a breezy little game somewhere between a game of skill and a game of storytelling. Its rules are explained in about 20 minutes. You can find out more about HfL at <a href="http://cobwebgames.com" rel="nofollow">Cobweb Games</a>.<br/><br/>This playtest was done with people who'd never played *any* type of roleplaying game before. They were quite bright, I admit, but otherwise unprepared. We failed gloriously and had a lot of fun.<br/><br/>This was a co-op game, meaning everyone was on the same team. Three characters on Team Victory:<br/><br/>Jason Mueller, the German student/hippie, who arranges flowerbeds according to Feng Shui rules in his free time. He thinks the Network's a horribly evil thing (you don't say) and that the game needs to be brought down from the inside... man. You know? And stuff.<br/><br/>Rhadika Some-Indian-Lastname-I-forgot, a girl who grew up in the slums of New Delhi to become Bollywood's most celebrated choreographer. She's doing it for the children: she wants to use the millions she'll doubtlessly win to build an orphanage. Aww.<br/><br/>Richard Brownman, Texan oilmagnate, patriarch of a failing oil empire. Instead of justly taking the blame for the failure of his family enterprise, he decided it's those pesky MIT fuckers with their alternative energies and their hybrids. So he struck a deal with the network: if he wins the show, the Network will use their connections to make a few particularly meddlesome PhDs become alternative energy sources themselves... IN HELL.<br/><br/>We start in Sleepytown, Germany, where our heroes are dropped off. They discover that their first goal is to raise the median temperature in this godforsaken corner of Germany by four degrees. "No problem," says Dick, "we'll just grab ourselves some newkular thingamajigs and dump 'em in a local river. Problem solved." Jason is eventually convinced to come along: the needs justify the means and so on. So our troop heads for Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant in France... where they find heightened security due to a bunch of hippies protesting in front of the plant.<br/><br/>Not a problem, says Rhadika, I know a trick. So she starts a bonfire a few hundred metres away from the fence and sets up a drum circle around said bonfire, playing her hippie-seducing Indian music. And sure enough, the hippies come and dance with her, thus causing the guards to tag along to make sure there's nothing untoward going on around that fire.<br/><br/>At the same time, Jason uses his gardening abilities to... tunnel under the fence. Don't ask. Once inside the plant, Richard bribes the first bunch of French security guards, and the gang walks away with a bag full of shiny green rods.<br/><br/>This was all smooth sailing so far--three conflicts, and all three simply resolved as successes. We almost had enough VP to achieve the first checkpoint.<br/><br/>However, at the source of the Blies, our trio ran into a bit of a problem. There was a little fair going on in Gronig, and the locals, drunk and amused, took some interest in the strangers trying to get very close to the source of their beloved Blies river. So Rhadika went for a Hail Mary pass, trying to throw the bag into the source out of a brisk run.<br/><br/>This was our first failure, and quite a bad one too. Rhadika toppled the tower of dice and took a Trauma. She stumbled in mid run, and being from Bollywood she stumbled in the most cinematographically pleasing way possible, opening the zipper on the bag while falling. And of course she fell face first into the fuel rods. The locals swarmed her, and Richard had to step in, beating a local to death with a fuel rod and throwing the rest of them into the river. Somehow, that raised the temperature, and check point one was achieved.<br/><br/>From here on out, things went pear-shaped in a hurry. Our group made it to a local airfield where there was an airshow in progress. Rhadika used her charms to lure a pilot into an abandoned hangar, while Richard and Jason stole his plane. However, even in the throes of cinematographically pleasing love-making, the pilot noticed his plane taxiing past the open hangar door, and started punching Rhadika in the irradiated face. Fortunately, a wrench thrown from the plane took care of him, and they were off--headed for Moscow, where they were told they had to hiiack the Transsiberian Express. It didn't come to that.<br/><br/>A moment after take-off, our contestants noticed a couple of real-life fighter jets on their tail. Looks like they were part of the flight show, and for some reason they had live ammo. The Doppeldecker our guys stole did have a swivel-mounted paintgun (why, dear Lord, WHY? Well, because we said so), and so we tried to at least block the pilots' sight. No such luck. We were taken down swiftly and barely escaped with our lives. Stopping the first car on the road next to the crash site and killing its driver, we were finally on our way to Moscow...<br/><br/>Where we were mowed down by the Russian Army while torturing and killing the head conductor's family (and dog!) to get the, uhm, key to the TSE out of him. We all died in the same roll, and boy did we deserve it.<br/><br/>This session was rather chaotic, narratively as well as mechanically, partly because this was the first session I ran without the system's creator and partly because, hey, it's Christmas, so we were all a little shit-faced already, but even complete failure was good fun. One of the rolls had something like six risk maneuvers, where the actor adds another d6 to the tower and rerolls the die. The guy built the tower brilliantly and effortlessly up to a height of 12 dice, but threw one d10 after another outside the target, until he finally hit it--bullseye, stack topple, our plane is going down. We were laughing, yelling at each other, generally having a great time. I highly recommend this system, even if the prospective players have zero roleplaying experience. All it takes is a few bright, brave minds with a taste for mayhem.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
