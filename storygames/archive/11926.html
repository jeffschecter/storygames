The blog takes over from the old webzine at imagonem.net - so far, it covers local gaming events and news, with a bit of reviewing and whatever comes along thrown in. I feel that it hasn't really found its form yet.<br/><br/>The paper magazine hasn't seen print in a while now, but I'm hoping to put one together for the big summer event, <a href="http://www.spillfestival.no/" rel="nofollow">Arcon</a>. The theme is zombies, but we'll bite anything.<br/><br/>If you, like the majority of the human species, do not understand Norwegian, google translate might give you the general shape of the content. Got any advice and/or opinions on where to take the project?<br/><br/>If you'd like to contribute to the zine, or have any news you think should go on the blog (I'm watching story games and this category, but I suspect a lot of cool stuff zips right past me) feel free to mail GKraag@gmail.com!<br/><br/>...aaand there's a small gift card prize up for best contribution to the paper edition.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
