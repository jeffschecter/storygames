                    This thread is a continuation of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1333" rel="nofollow">No Prep Games</a>. I just wanted to talk about quickie SotC play, though, so I'm starting a new one.<br/><br/>I ran Spirit of the Century with no prep a few weeks ago. We used the ultra-fast "pick your Superb ability and one aspect" method and off we went. Everything else about the characters was created on the fly in play. I didn't have an adventure planned, so I put them on the maiden voyage of the super airship <i>Prometheus</i> -- which was of course attacked by air pirates (and their terrible flying "Faraday ring") as soon as it was over the Atlantic.<br/><br/>We played for about 2.5 hours. We managed to learn the system, flesh out interesting PCs, and have two fistsful of blazing pulp action -- a success in my book.<br/><br/>SotC bills itself as a "pick up" pulp action game, which can be hard to understand when you're eyeballing a 400+ page book. But in practice it totally delivers. The easy to grok skill pyramid, character and scene aspects, and simple NPC generation make this game very no-prep friendly.<br/><br/>Has anyone else used Spirit for no-prep play like this? How did it work for you?                </div>

                            I can't say much that's not totally skewed, except to share an anecdote:  my brother, who tested some of the early versions, had enough success with the on the fly play that I was threatened with bodily harm if it werenot included in the final version, so I think it worked out pretty well for him too.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>
