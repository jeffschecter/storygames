But I know that, for my part, I'm a much better role-player (and GM) than I used to be 20+ years ago.  Heck, I'm much better than used to be three years ago!  I'm more creative, more conscious of different expectations around the table, more versed in different techniques, more prepared mentally, more dynamic, less scared, less tentative, etc.  <br/><br/>I've observed this over the years, and I've been pleased with the progrss.  The last few years in particular have offered interesting obeservations because the club I belong to has weekly games where people take turns running a variety of games, and we've had a lot of story games.  I've been able to track not only my own increased comfort with narration (not a negligible point considering English is not my native language), with shared authority, with stake-setting, and various related  bits of rules, but also other people's increased abilities in these areas.  <br/><br/>When we first started, it wasn't rare by the end of the evening for someone to be so worn, so spent from the effort in games like <i>Capes, octaNe, Wushu, PTA,</i> etc. that they would end up "passing" their turn because they just could not think of one more bit of action.  Now the same people confidently paint "word pictures" like pros, and never dream of passing their turn.  In fact, we now pretty much automatically start setting scenes and stakes in trad games like <i>Savage Worlds</i> or <i>True20</i>.<br/><br/>Not only do I think role-playing is a group of skills that can be learned and developped; I also think that you can develop different mixes of these skills for different games and approaches.  Anyone who wants to improve can (for varying values of "improve").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92370/#Comment_92370" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T19:16:44+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:16PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, of course role-playing involves skills that can be learned.  I don't think there's any grounds to say otherwise.<br/><br/>The trickier question is if there's things about roleplaying that <i>can't</i> be learned.  Personally, I think that's also true, but I think it's more a function of lack of interest that keeps some people from learning certain skills, and that cases where an individual is genuinely and permanently impaired at learning a skill are fairly rare.  (As in, a person who cannot use words well in real life due to some kind of physical condition will likely not learn how to use words well in a roleplaying game either; at some point the physical impairment is going to block them, no matter how much they want it and how much effort they put in.)<br/><br/>Whether lack of interest can be "learned around," I don't know.  But then, if they're not interested, they must have a good reason for not being interested.  There are plenty of fun things to do in this life: if a particular brand of roleplaying requiring a particular skill isn't more fun than the other ways they could be using their time, why <i>should</i> they bother learning that skill?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92373/#Comment_92373" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T19:40:08+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:40PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the kind of skill that is much easier to learn by doing than by reading about, yet reading about it is fascinating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92389/#Comment_92389" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T22:33:45+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's one of those questions that pops up every so often.

Having run a convention instead of gaming for the last 3 years, I've totaly forgotten all my gaming skills. I stll remember the proud day when I realised that I had become the leader of our party kind of by concensus, but now, I can't think of a plan better than baking cakes for people who don't like me.<br/><br/>AS for there being a list of qualities you need, well, I think there are a couple. Its to do with thinking on your feet, knowing when not to waste time, staying in character at the right moments, working with the (GM and) other players, not bugging people about irrelevant stuff... well, in my experience, anyway. And there are plenty of people I've seen come into games with none of those skills, an dpick them up, to a greater or lesser degree. For some people, rules like 'respect other people's personal space' are never going to stick (sigh), but even my dopiest player learnt some basic character-portrayal and thinking skills given time.<br/><br/>Now, for me, the next question is, given that learning roleplaying skills takes time and exposure, what's going to happen with the current glut of one-shot games currently being developed on this and similar forums? Without campaigns, where wil we get those skilled players to set an example to everyone else?

For example, I'm great at running games for my guy friends back home.  We've learnt over years of playing with each other how to read each others' signals, how to establish a rythm of in-character vs. out-of-character point of view, what's interesting, and so on.  To some extent, that's independant of the system we're using, or rather, we attach the set of social cues and guidelines we've established to the existing rules, to create system.   <br/><br/>Playing with my wife and another woman in Japan I feel like I'm starting all over again.  There are some specific techniques that I can employ to some effect, but I feel like we're all learning how to play together.<br/><br/>I guess I'm wary of saying roleplaying is a skill you learn, because it leads to the notion of "good" and "bad" roleplayers, which I don't think is useful.  I'd rather say that groups establish guidelines for communication, and learn to pick up signals from each other.  <br/><br/>What Sophie's saying about developing improv skills makes sense to me though, so I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bifi" title="Bifi"><img alt="Bifi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bifi">Bifi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92429/#Comment_92429" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T07:38:22+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  7:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Georgios might be on to something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my mind "roleplaying" is a broad set of skills, such as in-character acting, improvisation, tactical thinking, creativity, even interpersonal skills. There are various features of this:<br/>\n- To a significant extent those skills are independent. You can shine in some, yet suck in others.<br/>\n- They vary in the extent to which they can be improved by learning and to which they are dependent on talent or else.<br/>\n- Each instance of play utilises a different combination and level of various "roleplaying skills" as the combination of players' creative agendas, mood, rules system, interpersonal dynamics and else that forms the basis for techniques can vary so much.<br/>\n- The skills also vary in the extent to which they are transferable to instances of play with differing combinations of those elements. The "usability" of a roleplaying skill that was highly relevant in one instance in a new instance is a function of differences in all of those elements and I would say also of the level of mastery of that skill. A certain level of a certain skill, that is useful in one game, played with a certain group of players, might be anything from useful to slightly useful to obsolete (or maybe even detrimental) in another game, played with a different group of players.<br/>\n- Therefore it is nigh impossible to draw a clear line between roleplaying and non-roleplaying skills, as well as pinpoint the exact combination of skills and their desirable levels as "roleplayer's standard" (or maybe it can be done but it would be very broad).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I guess it's only my penchance for stating the obvious. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92440/#Comment_92440" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T08:18:24+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  8:18AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been noticing lately how different games help with different skills.<br/><br/>PTA is a nautilus machine for your skill framing muscles.<br/><br/>Mountain Witch is a treadmill for revealing secrets dramatically, bit by bit.<br/><br/>Dogs in the VIneyard gives brisk exercise in using the dice right along with the role-playing and while working escalating conflicts muscle group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92534/#Comment_92534" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T22:48:32+00:00" title="September  1, 2007 10:48PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2007 10:50PM by lachek.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans</cite>Is role-playing <b>a</b> skill you can learn?</blockquote>\n(Emphasis added)<br/>No, not at all - roleplaying are <b>many</b> skills you can learn, and probably also some skills that some people possess innately and others will never develop. And in some games, some skills are going to be more useful than others. I definitely share the outlooks of Georgios and Michal on that one, and Judd makes another great point - some games are going to require and foster different roleplaying skills than others.<br/><br/>I think there are definitely "good" and "bad" roleplayers, dependent on the game and social context. A total-immersion actor with an innate feel for what makes "story" might be a great LARPer and an absolutely lousy Twilight 2000 player, dependent also on the group's "Creative Agenda". A "bad" player may still be interested in improving hir performance in that particular context, but unfortunately we all too often treat hir as a "bad co-worker" rather than a "bad Monopoly player" and shun instead of teach.<br/><br/>If you want to talk about some amorphous blob called "roleplaying" rather than specific skills, I'd like to add that I think a key to becoming an overall "good roleplayer" is to play many different games in many different ways, and reflecting on your experiences. Learning it is not like lifting weights to mindlessly build certain muscles - you have to experiment, analyze the results, and be aware of the resulting choices you make. I can attest to the fact that methods and skills learned from games can often be very successfully transported to others. I can also attest that attempting to transport other learned methods and skills into some other games can spell disaster.

However, at the base of what we do, past all the numbers and attacks of opportunity, are the skills of:<br/><br/>* Taking on a role, and playing that role as if you were that person ("Acting")<br/>I mean, that's the most fundamental of everything.  All the other skills are layers on top of that:<br/>* Getting the other players involved or making them shine<br/>* Coming up with cool shit to say (lines, actions, etc) on the fly<br/>* Running a game as GM, or assisting a GM as a player<br/>* Tricking out your combat dude, etc.<br/><br/>But that core skill, the one that the namesake of our hobby is built on, is the ability/skill to take on a role and play them.<br/><br/>So whether I play Dead Inside or Rolemaster, Polaris or Savage Worlds, the core skill there is assumedly that "taking on a role, playing out that role". If I find a connection to my awesome badass Whispering Vault character this session, you can bet that that is improving a skill I can probably take over to Shadowrun and use (perhaps drowned out by d6 combat pools, but that's another point).<br/><br/><b>I am not skilled at "videogaming" because I aced Halo.</b><br/><br/>Playing Halo makes you good at Halo. Your actions 5 minutes into the game, and your actions when the Horde gets free, are two totally different levels. By that point, you've become skilled at manipulating the controls. Likewise, your first scripted action in Burning Wheel is not going to look and feel liks your scripted actions after ahving played 20 sessions of it...<br/><br/>...and yet the metaphor carries: <br/>Getting used to HALO means that you understand some of the fundamentals of FPSes, which you can apply to other games. Play enough deathmatch, and you can probably kick ass in Quake once you spend a few minutes getting used to the controls. Play team games, and you can get the squad FPS abilities that can carry over to Counterstrike or that Battlefield 2042 game. Same as in RPGs, even beyond the core of roleplaying: Learn the combat system to D&amp;D back and forth, and you're likely to be able to spot the benefits and drawbacks of TROS quicker than someone who's never played those games before.<br/><br/><b>I am not skilled at "boardgaming" because I usually win at Monopoly.</b><br/>After playing about a zillion games of Settlers of Catan, I picked up a dozen social and strategy skills that directly help me kick ass at El Grande, Tikal, etc.<br/><br/><b>I am not skilled at "cardgaming" because I know how to put together a great Magic deck.</b><br/><br/>But you're probably able to put together a deck of L5R faster than any newbie coming to card games for the first time. And how to think strategically about the resources in play, think a few steps ahead, etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, those're just my metaphors.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92710/#Comment_92710" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T02:37:49+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  2:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>However, at the base of what we do, past all the numbers and attacks of opportunity, are the skills of:<br/><br/>* Taking on a role, and playing that role as if you were that person ("Acting")<br/>I mean, that's the most fundamental of everything.

That I could be a wiz at tricking out my combat dude in Shadowrun, coming up with water-proof plans and executing them without a glitch... and still be god-awful at (as in not enjoying and not *getting into*) games like Primetime Adventures or With Great Power?\n<blockquote>But that core skill, the one that the namesake of our hobby is built on, is the ability/skill to take on a role and play them.<br/></blockquote>\nI agree with you that it is the one thing all roleplaying games have in common, but I disagree that it is at the core of all of them. I've taken part in lots of games, where "taking on a role" was part of the fun and experience but it wasn't really at the core of it. It was important, yes. But the groups' and the players' focus was elsewhere.\n<blockquote>Getting used to HALO means that you understand some of the fundamentals of FPSes, which you can apply to other games. </blockquote>\nLike Final Fantasy? Or maybe WoW? Starcraft II? Wii Sports? Pokemon? \n<blockquote><br/>After playing about a zillion games of Settlers of Catan, I picked up a dozen social and strategy skills that directly help me kick ass at El Grande, Tikal, etc.</blockquote>\nHow about Cranium? Monopoly? RoboRally? Pictionary? Space Hulk?  \n<blockquote>But you're probably able to put together a deck of L5R faster than any newbie coming to card games for the first time. And how to think strategically about the resources in play, think a few steps ahead, etc.</blockquote>\nOk then... try playing Fluxx. Or Solitaire. Hearts? Texas Hold' em? <br/><br/>Cardgames, Videogames, Boardgames... those are all very wide categories, games inside those categories share certain elements (cardgames use cards, boardgames use boards, etc.) but require a different set of skills from the people playing them. Just because I'm really good at certain boardgames, does not mean I have "understood" and "mastered" boardgames in general. Yes, some things I picked up in one game will carry over to certain other boardgames... but not all of them. I would say the same goes for RPGs. Sure, all of them are about playing a role to one extent or another, but it's the combination of those other sub-set of "roleplaying skills" that shape the gaming experience of each game. <br/><br/>Compare Shadowrun to a game like Shab-Al-Hiri Roach. You need to get into your character in both games, but I'd say that's where the similarities end. (Quips and gags not withstanding.) If you want to be involved in the game and participate you need to do fundamentally different things at the table. The ability to take on a role of somebody else is only part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92713/#Comment_92713" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T03:18:01+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  3:18AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the point is that you can take somebody who has not played an RPG but who plays card games, wargames, does improv, has a Lit deree and gets involved in storytelling festivals and they will not necessarily be great roleplayers.

In so far as things like being kind, or caring abut what other people think are skills, then those skills are useful for role-playing, but sort of boring as they frankly help out in almost any circumstance unless you are enduring a war or living in a refugee camp, maybe.<br/><br/>What interests me are skills that are particular to role-playing games, that really don't exist outside of that hobby, or even specific games in that hobby.  <br/><br/>Some examples:<br/><br/>* Learning the rules of D&amp;D backwards and forwards, so that when the minis hit the table, you no longer have to think about "what can I do" but can think about "what SHOULD I do". <br/><br/>* Playing Capes AT ALL: Lets face it, playing this game is a skill, period.  I love it, this is not a criticism, it is simply a fact.  <br/><br/>* Crafting good challenges in In a Wicked Age.  My experience is that often people, when they first start playing that game, go too easy on people.  There challenges are a bit...wishy washy.  Then, they go the other direction, and their challenges are things like "I rip your head off and toss it into the sun, and cast your soul into the pit of Hell!"  But then they settle down into the exact right "I stab you in the throat" range which makes the game hum along perfectly.  This skill is related to the skills of setting good stakes/goals in games like Dust Devils; stakes that move the story forward in interesting ways and push your fellow players, but not moving TOO FAST forward or pushing them TOO FAR.<br/><br/>* Punching keys in the Shadow of Yesterday.  My friend Piers...oh man, he is the master of this skill.  This guy can hit one key, sell it off and in the process hit another, buy a new one, hit it, sell another one, all in the course of like a minute and a half.  Everyone just sits around the table stunned by the masterful juggling of keys Piers performs.<br/><br/>* Winging it as a GM.  This is the skill at taking what the players are throwing at you, processing it quickly, and hammering it into some new set of situations/characters etc. right in the moment and throwing it back at them.  Games like With Great Power and In a Wicked Age are fantastic for training this skill, and can really stretch a GM to his/her limit trying to keep up with what is going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92846/#Comment_92846" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T19:59:52+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  7:59PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans</cite>* Winging it as a GM.

I say this with absolutely zero professional authority, so someone who actually considers themselves a pro or amateur storyteller may correct me on this one, but I think this is essentially the rather widely applicable ability to creatively integrate elements created by audience feedback into a coherent and intriguing narrative. Motivational speakers, salespeople and other professions designed to woo and awe crowds also likely benefit from this skill.<br/><br/>Yeah, I guess basically I'm calling GMs charlatans and liars. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>"Winging it" is also one of the key areas where I believe recent roleplaying games have been able to make a real difference. It used to be somewhat of a Black Art within the hobby, an elevated state of being stumbled upon by some of the Great amongst our ranks, but many game authors and theorists have managed to distill and formulate certain pieces of it to the point where you can get pretty good just by book learnin'. As examples, I'd suggest the progression of Sin in Dogs in the Vineyard and mechanized flags like Issues in PTA and Shock:, Kickers/Bangs in Sorcerer and Beliefs in BW/BE. All these mechanics, and a tremendous amount of articles on the subject floating around the Worldwide Intarweb, provide a wealth of knowledge for budding young GMs, old geezers who never "got it", and the in-betweeners where I count myself.\n<blockquote>What interests me are skills that are particular to role-playing games, that really don't exist outside of that hobby, or even specific games in that hobby.</blockquote>\nI'll provide another one:<br/><br/>* Purposeful and competent character generation. I've been through a ton of characters that look great on paper but which I absolutely hate in play. Making characters that aren't just interesting but also fun to play is a skill I think is very unique to our hobby. A good PC is not just a strong character from a work of fiction - many awesome, deep characters from books and movies would be horribly dull or outright torturous to play, depending on the system. In particular, I usually have problems making characters that aren't just cool on their own, but also work well in interactions with others. In trad Story Before games, characters also need to have a reason to move with and drive the plot, not dig their heels in to deal with the demons in their own head.\n<blockquote>* Crafting good challenges in In a Wicked Age. My experience is that often people, when they first start playing that game, go too easy on people.  ...  But then they settle down into the exact right "I stab you in the throat" range which makes the game hum along perfectly.</blockquote>\n(Off topic) I've been thinking about this recently and I'm wondering if this isn't in some pretty large part due to particular play preference. Sure, certain games with certain themes work best with some range of intensity of challenges - but I'm wondering if there isn't a reason our games tend to come down to things like inter-PC brawls featuring eyeball-eating, bloody electronic mind-rape and the Abbot's ritual bloodletting for seven days and seven nights to ensure an ample supply of virgins for the Gods. Maybe "In A Wicked Age" works alright with tamer challenges? Maybe it even works with challenges that are less in-your-face? I haven't playtested that approach, of course, but my feeling is that more subtle, less severe challenges might just make for a differently toned game, not necessarily a "worse" one.<br/><br/>Related to that, I believe, is a theory that's currently budding in my brain regarding what our friend Mr. Weissengruber calls "Royale with Cheese moments". I'm wondering whether a lot of story games don't push too hard towards transformative challenges, at the expense of exposition and exploration scenes. I may start a new thread regarding that in the next few weeks if it still seems interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92953/#Comment_92953" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T11:31:44+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 11:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So my 2 cents.<br/><br/>A lot of this is saying the same stuff, in my opinion.  Of course, that was because the terms were not defined so we're making assumptions about what was meant by roleplaying.<br/><br/>So in my comments I will include what I am meaning when I say roleplaying.<br/><br/>There are four skill sets going on here:<br/>social skills - these are the ones we learn around the table, dealing with other people and I think are the MOST important skills to learn to be a good roleplayer.  I think most people that understand the dynamics among the real people and figure out how to focus on friendly energy around the table will be more successful at having fun than those learning skills from the other sets.<br/><br/>game skills - This is game specific.  As mentioned, learning some games carry skills over to other games.  Unless the game is REALLY strange or unique (very rare) by learning it's rules you're at least covering the skills needed to play a variety of games.  As such I believe that the more games you learn allows you a greater breadth of game skills and thus would make you a better roleplayer.<br/><br/>narrative skills - As a GM or a descriptive player this is definately a set of skills that I have developed over the years.  At first my GMing skills are building but now I find I flex these muscles more no matter if I am running the game or playing.  Some people say "you have to be creative to accomplish this" but as many of our improv and writers will agree, these are often skills you develop.  Sure it comes naturally to some folks but there are definately a set of techniques to be worked on.<br/><br/>acting skills - This is useful on many levels - it's basically your ability to bring across a fictional character so that the players can make a distinction between the player and the character.  There is depth involved in thinking like a person that is not you as well as thinking like mastering tone, inflection, accents and utilizing props and body language to bring across a character.<br/><br/>Other than the social skills I don't think working on any of the other skills sets would neccessarily make you a better role-player.  I certainly think that by being self-critical and by seeing how you should have handled various situations differently in order to make everyone having fun at the table would definately go a long way to improving anyone.  Thus this collection can be focused on - play a variety of game types; practice improv and writing a few pages, flexing those narrative muscles; watching actors (especially stage actors) critically and look into things like psychology and linguistics.  It's complex and some people are going to be better at certain things than others but I think you will improve as a roleplayer as you develop these skills.<br/><br/>Let me reiterate - none of these skills matter if you don't learn the social ones.  You and your friends will have more fun once you get the social skills down.  Every instance of gaming dysfunction I have ever encountered at the gaming table stemmed from someone breaking social contract or just plain being a dick and could have been better handled by people working hard to be certain everyone around the table is having fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
