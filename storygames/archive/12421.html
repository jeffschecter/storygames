Walton</cite>Like, if I was going to run Scarlet Wake, it would be hard for me to get in contact with the designer and give him feedback and, even if I did, there's no reason for me to think he would take my feedback and use it to make a better draft somewhere down the road.  While labeled a "playtest draft," Scarlet Wake is basically a free game now.  And I guess my current impulse is to say that I personally like that approach to playtesting better, playtesting without future expectations, playtesting that is basically just play.  It can still be critical or explorative, but I'm often critical and explorative when trying "finished" games.<br/><br/>I think we can see evidence that other folks are already embracing this approach in some ways.  When people run Geiger Counter now, sometimes they send me feedback, but often times they're just doing it because they like the game and want to play it.  So it's not so much that I'm suggesting a new approach to playtesting that I discovered, but that I'm watching how people approach Geiger or how I approach Danger Patrol, say, and feeling like -- especially with free products -- the line between play and playtesting isn't very distinct.  And, honestly, I think that makes playtesting a lot more fun, even if the process of game development is often slower, because the focus is on enjoying the game rather than fixing the game.  Fixing the game becomes a byproduct of play rather than the purpose of play.</blockquote>\nThat totally makes sense; and I consider abandoned playtest docs to be free games with the last caveat mentioned in my original post (abandoned in the hope someone will fix or hack it). This is, cynically, my view on the type of playtesting you describe:<br/><br/>- If it's going to eventually be finished and my playtest doesn't matter to the designer (in the sense of helping him or her improve it), I'm going to play something already finished, that's polished NOW, and wait for the final version.<br/>- If the designer can't be bothered to get playtest feedback from the people playing their game, then the game clearly doesn't matter to the designer. Why in God's name should it matter to me?<br/><br/>I also think the line between playtest and free game is only as malleable as you describe it being for Geiger and Danger Patrol because of the way you and Harper market those games: you explicitly refer to them as "Playtest documents," you say "This is a free game I'm working on and might publish when it's finished." Your description of Geiger a while ago as the beta of a free game implies that it is a free game for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>That said.<br/><br/>I feel like you're interpreting what I said as saying that playtesting is inherently un-fun: that couldn't be further from the truth. There's only been one time I was playtesting a game and REALLY not enjoying it; I went to the designer and said "Hey, I'm not going to do this playtest any more, because this game is totally not fun for me" and their response was "I need your feedback, you said you'd playtest my game, so you need to show up and do it." That was a real edge case, though. Much of the time when I'm playtesting something critically, I'm enjoying myself, too. It's a different kind of enjoyment.<br/><br/>My point is that playtests, if they are REALLY playtests, aren't free. You're paying for the game with your time and your feedback. That doesn't make it wrong to have fun; but it does mean that you're playing with a responsibility. I do think you can have fun and focus on fixing the game; but even if your playtesting experience is super low-pressure, you're still playing it to see what you can improve, right? Because if it couldn't be improved further, it wouldn't be a playtest document, it'd be a finished game.<br/><br/>ALSO! Sometimes things that are hard work are really fun and rewarding. I love postmortems after playtesting. I guess basically, my feeling on playtesting goes with my aversion to free games: if I'm getting something for value, I'm going to pay for it one way or another.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279126/#Comment_279126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T12:13:32+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 12:13PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I absolutely agree that playtesting is a whole different form of engagement than just playing.

But saying "keep playing even though you hate it" strikes me as a poor way to run a playtest.<br/><br/>To contribute to the topic at hand, I'd say one commonality between playtests and free games is that I'm more willing to accept hiccups in both, but I guess in a playtest I'd feel more inclined to say in detail "this is what my hiccup was and how I would try to fix it" whereas with "just" a free game, I might just be like 'oh well, it's still fun and it's free'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279154/#Comment_279154" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T15:19:21+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  3:19PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I allays kind of feel that digital play test copies should be free, but i mean something specific by that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think with playtesting it's critical to understand <i>what</i> you are play testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Are you checking the ground level mechanics, seeing if they are a sound foundation for play?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Are you testing the balance of things built upon that foundation, details like are swords over powered, or do social fights take too many rounds?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Are you an outside group testing how well a draft version communicates the game?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Are you getting a nearly finished product that maybe needs an editing pass?<br/>\n<br/>\n1 &amp; 2 I would only consider doing with my own groups, maybe a little bit of 2 with select groups that i know personally. this is manly because some of the best feedback you get at this stage is just watching people play.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I would only consider as a free digital down load, because there is value in both the work put into the game and work it takes to play test and offer feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Is where preview copies or "ashcans" come into play, I think these can work as products at conventions and such. I think Vincent moved quite a bit of the Apocalypse world previews at game storm this year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279302/#Comment_279302" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-04T22:01:52+00:00" title="July  4, 2010 10:01PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>then the game clearly doesn't matter to the designer.

I don't mean to sound like JD Corley here, but why would the intentions of the designer matter to whether or not you can get something out of a game?<br><br>That sounds a bit flip, but I think this is an interesting question, and a huge, ongoing theme of tons of story games and indie press-related discussion. I mean, in literature, The Author has been dead for years -- but she is alive and well in indie games and running rampant to a really remarkable degree.<br><br>And in this particular case, where we're talking about the designer's intentions <i>mostly in regards to publication</i>, it seems particularly weird to swear off <i>playing a game</i> because you don't think <i>the author cares about what you think.</i> I feel like there is some serious bleed-in from somewhere -- maybe because, as you mentioned in the other thread, you live around so many game designers. Or maybe there is just a missing link here that has to do with it being a playtest document?<br><br>Is playing somebody's game equivalent to or related to making a personal connection with that person?

It is TOTALLY about being a playtest document. Let me put it a different way.<br><br>There are more than a few published games I'm itching to play: Bliss Stage, Doctor Who, Nobilis, A Taste For Murder, more Annalise. And there are so many of my friends' games in playtest I want to play! And then there are the games in development by 2SP that I <i>need</i> to play (and am also excited to play, but I think they count differently). So that means there is a ton of games on my radar right now.<br><br>With that many games competing for my time already, I'm not likely to look twice at an abandoned playtest document. Basically, it boils down to bad marketing: if <i>the person who created it</i> doesn't care about it any more, then it makes me wonder just how much I'll get out of it. I mean, when playtesting, I'd rather play a game in active development any day of the week, because even if it's not fun, it's at least <i>useful</i> to someone. <br><br>So it boils down to superficiality, really. I'm much less likely to take a game to prom if even its mama thinks it's ugly.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279319/#Comment_279319" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T05:52:25+00:00" title="July  5, 2010  5:52AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CAVEAT!

Even the decision not to play is an important one.<br><br>For example, 3:16 is one of the games I've had the opportunity to playtest. I ran though one mission. The others in my group were ready and eager to keep going. Me.. I wanted nothing more to do with the game after that. I think this is mainly because I was so tired that night, but it was also because 3:16 is a "downer" game. You happily kill monsters on other planets until you discover your superiors are conducting universal genocide. Emotionally, I just couldn't handle that at the time.<br/><br/>So, if I had someone tell me they didn't want to play, I would definitely conduct a form of exit interview to find out why.
