But then so is anything when you don't know the rules. We had just had our first BDTP in two sessions. It took a long time and got confusing, so I've been reviewing the rules. I discovered a few things:<br/><br/>First off, opposed rolls for bonus dice are always defensive. You have to use a passive ability for those checks, you can't use some other ability. Oops! I didn't know that. So any other bonus dice come from parallel checks only. Ok, I got that bit.<br/><br/>Then one of the players realized how to game the system more. She had Harm 1 and 2 and suffered another Harm 1, which would get pushed up to 3. She immediately spent one Pool point to clear her Harm 1, so the new Harm 1 didn't get bumped up. Then she spent another point to clear that Harm, so she wouldn't suffer a penalty die on her next action. Well played!<br/><br/>We really struggled with the rules for multiple characters in a conflict. We had two characters (Rose the Ammeni thief and James the ratkin wanderer) vs. one (Vincento the army sergeant), and we weren't sure how that worked. Both Rose and James had the same intention (rescue Francis, the captured prisoner) so that suggests they'd always be working in gestalt mode, one causing Harm and the other providing bonus dice. Is that true? If so it would certainly simplify things. But then it makes me wonder how you decide which one is the main and which provides the bonus dice... That also suggests that having two on one in BDTP is kinda brutal, and you'll probably get your ass handed to you. That's cool if its true, but I want to make sure that I'm playing it right first.<br/><br/>Another thing that slowed us was how the players were too focused on the fiction rather than the mechanics. They were overly detailed and asking a lot of questions, like "is there a fire nearby?" and so on. I was pressing them to get their goals - why is important if there's a fire, how does that change things for you? That extended to them choosing their actions. They focused on whether they *could* accomplish something in the fiction rather describing what they *wanted* to accomplish. I'm assuming that's leftover old-school-gaming think - that accomplishing things is dependent on the GM's whim, so they're first trying to figure out what I'll let them do. I tried to shift the point of view by saying things like, "so you want an opposed Stealth roll for Harm", but it took a while for it to catch on.<br/><br/>I don't want it to sound like I'm purely complaining here. The fiction was really interesting, we had this badass sergeant facing off against a pacifist thief and an adrenaline-fueled ratkin desperate to save his brother. There was sneaking, rats used as a distraction (awesome), ratkin jumping on people's faces (double awesome), and hand grenades (we have explosions every damn session, recurring awesome). I just want to understand BDTP more so it can be smoother.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416692/#Comment_416692" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T02:48:53+00:00" title="June 20, 2013  2:48AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BDtP is a pretty intense procedure. Ideally players will only reserve it for the important situations, but that depends on a player realizing that they're a legitimate artistic participant in the game experience and not just a drunk monkey pressing buttons at random. (The latter can be a problem: if a player seems to be declaring BDtP just because they can, even in situations where nobody's interested, I try to talk them out of it.)<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>Prevent players from doing natural healing (spending Pool to heal) during BDtP - it's not the system intent, and doesn't have fruitful effect on the game. (Allowing players to convert Pool into healing just means that you need to grind through three times the already considerable number of Harm levels, probably on a character whose player is too stupid to give up - better to not go there.) Ideally you'd only do natural healing when it naturally flows from the fiction: in between scenes, as time passes, or when characters specifically slow down to recuperate. As with many other things, it depends on the group standards to determine when many mechanical options are legitimate based on fictional positioning; "do it to do it", as the nephew game Apocalypse World puts it.<br/><br/>Having more characters on one side of BDtP than the other is very brutal - you need considerable mechanical superiority (basically, Secrets that even the odds) or blatantly superior positioning (something that severely restricts the other guys from ganging up on you) to overcome the superior numbers. This'll be even worse if the SG is strict on defensive positioning (as I am): a character who gets to act unresisted  may e.g. cause their entire check result as Harm if the opponent doesn't have the time and luxury to defend against both attackers at once.<br/><br/>The system itself does not particularly care about whether this is good or bad for your fictional inclinations. Rather, this is a game where you select among tools. In this case those tools could be written out somewhat more explicitly (I tried to do that in my Solar System booklet), as the original rules just leave you to figure out BDtP with many opponents for yourself.<br/><br/>If you feel that your game is suffering because numbers count for too much, pay attention to two specific principles that may be engaged by the SG to the degree he finds useful: <ul><li>Being a "character" in a fictional sense does not necessarily empower you to participate in a conflict. My default mode in playing TSoY is that only named characters are "characters" in a mechanical sense: other people in the fiction may come into play as conditions and opportunities of various sorts, but not as conflict participants in their own right. For example, a captain with 30 soldiers under his command would normally enter conflict "alone", and then have the use of his soldiers by the way of his Abilities and Secrets, instead of having 31 separate participants in the conflict.</li><li>The rules say that Gestalt is optional, but the way I run it (I consider it optional for the Story Guide in his role as mechanical arbitor, not optional for players on a case-by-case basis), characters are always gestalted when their goals in conflict are identical. Thus traditional "adventuring parties" who enter a conflict merely because one of them has a problem end up acting in gestalt. This rule/ruling severely cuts down on the mechanical effectiveness of a team: two characters in gestalt are merely say 20% more effective than one character.</li></ul>\nI find that BDtP works beautifully with multiple characters if I play by the above principles: neither the SG nor the players can introduce massively overpowering forces into conflict if "declaring BDtP actions" is something that is only allowed for conflict sides, not every individual character who happens to be present. This makes scenes like e.g. having a single warrior defend a bridge against an army feasible, which they wouldn't be if there was any ambiguity about who deserves to have actions and who doesn't.<br/><br/>Regarding which character is the main actor in a Gestalt, that's easy: all Gestalt participants declare their actions in free and clear (probably they'll have a little plan to go with it), and the main actor is the one whose action is decisive in progressing towards the goal. If this is unclear, then the main actor is the one who has more at stake (so if e.g. the conflict stakes are about my character's honor, then your character can mostly just aid - the spotlight is on me). If both these matters are unclear (which is worrisome by itself: usually BDtP-worthy conflicts should have somewhat personal stakes), then the main actor is the one who's been out of the spotlight for longest (that is, the one who was not main last round). In truth the SG does best to simply let the players organize themselves, he doesn't need to care about anything except the final results. (Of course this again assumes players who take responsibility - if they're just min-maxing on who's got the highest Ability score, you need to hit them with a stick and watch over them until they figure out how to respect the fiction.)<br/><br/>As for the focus on fiction you mention, it's a familiar phenomenon. I would not characterize it as players caring about the fiction too much (you can't in this sort of game - caring about the fiction is the alpha and omega of all this), but rather as players not being comfortable about the respective roles of the Story Guide and the other players. You should take your time leading by example, encouraging the players and drawing lines when they cross them; this process will help them learn how much the game expects of them. I mean, they need to understand that the Story Guide literally does not care to decide whether there is a campfire present - he cares about whether it's credible and true to life for there to be a camp fire, but assuming that it's not absurd, he has better things to worry about, and he's only too happy to allow you to have the fight choreography you want.<br/><br/>Perhaps an useful way to explain this to your players would be to note that you like how much they care about respecting the fiction, but that this game requires them to not merely respect the fiction, but also to author it: it's their job just as much as yours to invent fictional detail, and your job merely to overrule them when they overstep. This is no harder for them than traditional play: they merely need to tell to other players how they perceive the fictional space.<br/><br/>Probably it's a good idea to also establish a communicative standard: whenever players ask you about something that does not pertain to dramatic coordination, backstory or NPC agenda (the three things the SG controls about the fiction in TSoY), you should answer by throwing the question back: "You tell me." My experience is that if you outright refuse to provide answers where it's not your job to bring them, it won't take players more than fifteen minutes to start providing them themselves. After that you'll need to over-rule them a few times when they e.g. try to ascribe motivations to NPCs or skip a conflict by narration, but that's an effective way of teaching.<br/><br/>(This is not to say that you don't have a responsibility of story-telling; it's still your job to bring the ideas in the form of a flavourful setting and rich NPCs and interesting situations and poetic detail. It's just that that last bit, poetic detail, may come from any player at the table: they don't need you to tell them how desperate or idiosyncratic the denizens of Near are, how dirty their villages, how amazing their magic. In my own play I usually end up providing about 50% of the poetic detail as a Story Guide, because I'm often deepest into the setting and thus have the most clear picture of it; the rest comes from the players when they exercise their full membership in the fraternity of storytellers.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416709/#Comment_416709" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T10:30:06+00:00" title="June 20, 2013 10:30AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ricky,<br/><br/>Also, get the Solar System booklet if you haven't already.

When they first use it, I try and use all the tricks, Defend, changing stakes, roll for bonus, etc. So they can see that there is a lot of depth, but also, to try and bring serious harm to the PCs. This establishes that BDTP is a great tool to use if you care about the results, but not worth it if it is a roll that is not a big deal.<br/>  I think with BDTP, it how and when you use it matters how you GM.<br/>1) If you are trying to bring a real challenge to the PCs and their goals, then BDTP requires you to give the Antagonist(s) enough resources to face the entire group if need be. This can be accomplished b high pool, optimized secrets and having them have named NPCs as lackeys. This method works great when your group rises to the challenge. But this technique will discourage player from using BDTP if they are not that sort of group<br/>2) You can use BDTP to establish a flag.signal that he player can use to let the table know that this is a story/character/etc. important roll for you. In this case, you need to focus on how the NPC is thwarting the PCs goals and let the BDTP be more of a system or show how much it costs to get their true desires instead of an even contest. Much like in ditv, BDTP can be a "win" button that just determines how much it costs to get what you want. In this case, the PC needs to take damage (maybe use parallel attacks more), but with an unspoken assumption that the PC(s) will overcome this opposition eventually.<br/>3) Playing it for the "game" aspect. BDTP is a fun game mechanic. It can be jarring story-wise or can bog down play for people who do not enjoy this part of the game..But for mechanics nerds, this is a fun sub-system. For this sort of play, you want to throw out plausible opportunities to use it and then play fair. Follow the rules and set opposition such that both sides have a fighting chance.<br/>  I hope this helps.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416789/#Comment_416789" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-21T12:20:58+00:00" title="June 21, 2013 12:20PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this is useful to you, but when I encountered BDtP, I just had my players set their goal, and then start doing stuff to try to get it.

We had a few great moments in the game, but I think I made a few mistakes as a GM, too, not the least of which was my not understanding BDtP well enough. PCs ending up bulldozing the villains. With no initiative (right?), I found that as soon as a fight started, all the players were declaring their attacks against the villain before I had a chance to say what the villain did. How do you deal with that? And that is before we even got to BDtP. Once there, I got bogged down in the complexity of the process, and I'm not sure I did everything right. Next time I'm definitely going to take Dave's advice and make my villains stronger, mechanically, and + named lackeys.<br/><br/>Everything else about TSOY makes perfect sense to me; (well, except the problem noted above with the lack of initiative rules) but BDtP is still really hard for me to wrap my head around.

Just click the link if you feel like reading far too many pages of minutiae about how I execute TSoY in play. I especially recommend this to anybody who feels that they don't understand the BDtP procedures, or some other rules; they're the same rules, but sometimes it helps to read the same thing written in a different way. (And of course I had the benefit of hindsight and years of play when writing my text, compared to Clinton's situation when he wrote the original, so it's no wonder if I manage a more detailed treatment.)\n<blockquote>With no initiative (right?), I found that as soon as a fight started, all the players were declaring their attacks against the villain before I had a chance to say what the villain did. How do you deal with that? And that is before we even got to BDtP. Once there, I got bogged down in the complexity of the process, and I'm not sure I did everything right.</blockquote>\nTSoY does not have initiative rules because you don't need them: everything generally happens "simultaneously" in the game mechanics, even when we as players might imagine the fight choreography (or whatever it is that you're doing - I call all those little details of fictional description "fight choreography" for reasons that'll become evident) happening in a certain sort of sequence.<br/><br/>In simple conflict this lack of initiative means that it doesn't matter who declares their action first: you will, nevertheless, hear their opponent as well. "I will strike him dead right now" might be what player A says about player B's character; the Story Guide's correct answer to this in TSoY and other similar conflict-resolving games is <i>not</i> "Roll the dice!" - rather, it's to ask player B "What then, do you want to accomplish here?" If the conflict is against a NPC, then the Story Guide tells the other players what his NPC wants in this situation.<br/><br/>The above is very important, you cannot play TSoY differently - it is not the same game by any measure of design if you do not honor the conflict resolution philosophy. The entire idea in how the game has you design characters and how they're used is that players have a "guarantee of matched wills": there is no way in the game to short-circuit the fact that sooner or later any disagreement or conflict of interest between two named characters will come down to a comparison of Ability checks fairly executed. No advance preparations to void the fighting chance, no initiative, no surprise attacks, no gotchas - you've got a guarantee that the details of fight choreography are there merely for the entertainment of the players, not as a cunning ploy intended to rob your character of a fighting chance. You chose your probability of winning the fight when you chose the value for your fighting Ability. When actual play is on-going, you can just coast along and laugh at outrageous descriptions, confident that you don't need to fight every little bit of narration, fearing that any small detail could bite you in the ass - they can't, you'll still get your dice roll and a chance to describe how your character deals with all the problems.<br/><br/>(Somebody might ask at this point: if it's not a game of skill, and everything comes down to a bald dice roll anyway, then why play? The answer is that TSoY is not a traditional adventure rpg, and its goals are not traditional: the point of the game is not to overcome a challenge provided by the GM, but merely to portray interesting characters in dramatic situations and see what happens. In a game without any intent to come upon and overcome challenges, it should be no great surprise if the rules system is totally unsuitable for clever problem-solving or rules-lawyering your way into victory. This game doesn't even have a "victory", except in the abstract sense that everybody wins when we portray our characters faithfully and do not flinch from compelling dramatic consequences.)<br/><br/>Only when both sides have clear goals established will the dice be rolled. Conflict resolution in TSoY does not consist of "declaring attacks", but it's rather about declaring goals, choosing an Ability, describing how the Ability applies to the situation, and then, once the opponent is also ready, rolling the dice to see who got the better result. The winner gets their way, limited by their goals, chosen Ability and the way they described their approach. (All extremely simplified, of course - there are various wrinkles you can introduce at your pleasure.)<br/><br/>As for how all this works in Bringing Down the Pain (which I call "Extended Conflict" in my Solar System text, just to have a little less colorful name for it): there is no initiative in BDtP, either. Rather, each "combat round" begins with an important phase we call the "free-and-clear" (or "negotiation phase", as I call it in the Solar System booklet). This is not optional, you have to have the free-and-clear! It is the place in the system where players declare their intended actions for the round of play. It does not matter who tells their action first, and you can revise your action description until everybody is satisfied. The point here is definitely not that whoever talks first gets to roll first, and being first or last to reveal your action makes no difference because the free-and-clear continues until everybody's happy with the declared actions.<br/><br/>That last point is important: if I declare that my character will step up and try to talk to yours, and then you declare that your character is trying to take off my head with a sword, then it's entirely cool for me to go "OK, so you want to be tough, eh? I'll draw my sword and chop back, then!" The free-and-clear is a negotiation of fight choreography, you cannot win or lose the conflict during it. It exists merely to put actions in order, to figure out what's going to happen this round.<br/><br/>Once you're done with the free-and-clear, you should have a set of actions, one for each character in the conflict: what they're doing, which Ability they're using, how the outcome of the Ability check will be applied (bonus dice or Harm, resisted or not). After you've figured this out, it's just a matter of rolling the dice. The results are applied simultaneously, as always.<br/><br/>As you can see from the above, there is no place in the game where you would need an initiative system. All actions are either simultaneous, or their order is resolved by seeing who rolled highest. If players are pressuring the Story Guide to somehow skip somebody's chance of asserting their goals and rolling the dice, that's the same as trying to skip somebody's turn in Monopoly by shouting at them - it's playing wrong. The correct answer is to calm down, raise your hand and have the players settle down; then you can tell them what the opponent is doing to counter their move, and once that's clear, you can distribute some dice and see to the actual execution of the situation.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416919/#Comment_416919" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T16:25:53+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  4:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 6:48PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't ya think it might be better if it just had "traditional" initiative?  <br/>I mean, it's(BDtP) a part of the game that is most like old-school rpgs.  <br/>It'd make the whole figuring out "was that perpendicular or parallel?" thing sorta moot.<br/><br/>Why can I spell perpendicular but find parallel virtually impossible?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416949/#Comment_416949" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T00:32:52+00:00" title="June 24, 2013 12:32AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Traditional initiative could be better in some ways, maybe - it's not technically better, but perhaps some people would find it easier to understand. If I was switching it around, though, I wouldn't add an initiative-establishing step - those are useless in the vast majority of games that use them. (By useless I mean that they impact the actual outcomes too rarely, and when they do it's usually not a positive impact. Meanwhile you're stuck counting initiative numbers in every situation ever, even as the initiative always boils down to "everybody gets to act on their turn".)<br/><br/>If I was doing initiative, I'd have the Story Guide call various general categories of action ("magic", "talking", "spirit shamanism", "pole-arms", "swords", "running around and pulling switches", whatever) in the order that he deems proper for initiative; when your intended action comes up, you call the SG on it and execute whatever it was. If two players call on the same step, then their actions are simultaneous for good or ill.<br/><br/>In this system all actions would be parallel by default, so we'd need some way of mitigating Harm. The obvious move would be to take a (yet one more) page out of the Sorcerer playbook and allow players to "abort to defend": as long as your action hasn't yet come up, you can relinquish it to make a defensive move instead. If your action has already happened, you can defend as well. If your action is simultaneous, you cannot defend right then and there.<br/><br/>(Of course you could go full Sorcerer and just have everybody roll first and then figure out initiative on the order of success. However, we were attempting a more traditional initiative system here.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416993/#Comment_416993" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T13:42:00+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  1:42PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure if that resolves anything?   <br/>You'd almost need a way to resolve simultaneous actions differently then other actions.<br/>I'm not sure I have a tidy answer either? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416996/#Comment_416996" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T13:56:16+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  1:56PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think the value of initiative is trumped by the value of the free and clear phase.

The negotiation during free-and-clear takes care of confusion, the rolls (with their mechanical consequences) happen simultaneously, and the fictional events happen in the order that is appropriate. Eero's Solar System booklet was helpful in establishing that for me.\n<blockquote>If you feel that your game is suffering because numbers count for too much, pay attention to two specific principles that may be engaged by the SG to the degree he finds useful: <ul><li>Being a "character" in a fictional sense does not necessarily empower you to participate in a conflict. My default mode in playing TSoY is that only named characters are "characters" in a mechanical sense: other people in the fiction may come into play as conditions and opportunities of various sorts, but not as conflict participants in their own right. For example, a captain with 30 soldiers under his command would normally enter conflict "alone", and then have the use of his soldiers by the way of his Abilities and Secrets, instead of having 31 separate participants in the conflict.</li></ul></blockquote>Yes, that's what we were doing. At one point the army sergeant won an Infantry roll for Harm, and we narrated that as him sending some soldiers to guard the perimeter. The soldiers were merely fictional expressions of his ability.<br/><br/>I had already statted up the soldiers as a group-character (the "encamped army", I called them), and I would have only brought them into BDTP if they were interacted with as a whole, like if someone's intention became "scare the army out of this encampment".\n<blockquote><ul><li>The rules say that Gestalt is optional, but the way I run it (I consider it optional for the Story Guide in his role as mechanical arbitor, not optional for players on a case-by-case basis), characters are always gestalted when their goals in conflict are identical. Thus traditional "adventuring parties" who enter a conflict merely because one of them has a problem end up acting in gestalt. This rule/ruling severely cuts down on the mechanical effectiveness of a team: two characters in gestalt are merely say 20% more effective than one character.</li></ul>\nI find that BDtP works beautifully with multiple characters if I play by the above principles: neither the SG nor the players can introduce massively overpowering forces into conflict if "declaring BDtP actions" is something that is only allowed for conflict sides, not every individual character who happens to be present. This makes scenes like e.g. having a single warrior defend a bridge against an army feasible, which they wouldn't be if there was any ambiguity about who deserves to have actions and who doesn't.<br/></blockquote>That is exceptionally enlightening. I'll definitely use those guidelines moving forward. It makes the whole thing play like a one-on-one BDTP, just with more die-rolling.<br/><br/>It also encourages players in a multi-conflict to select multiple, lesser intentions. That encourages the other side to give on the least important intentions. If in my example Rose the thief had offered the intention "Sneak past the army sergeant", I would have given immediately just to focus all my resources on the more important intention "Rescue Francis" from James the ratkin.\n<blockquote><br/>Prevent players from doing natural healing (spending Pool to heal) during BDtP - it's not the system intent, and doesn't have fruitful effect on the game. (Allowing players to convert Pool into healing just means that you need to grind through three times the already considerable number of Harm levels, probably on a character whose player is too stupid to give up - better to not go there.)</blockquote>I'm surprised by this answer. As you point out, converting Pool into healing dynamically means that the players have more resources at their disposal. Certainly that might lead into a long drawn-out BDTP where the characters finish with piles of Harm and no pool points, which means they stagger along for a while beaten up and getting their asses handed to them (penalty dice from Harm, and no pool points for bonus dice or Secrets). That sounds like an entertaining option! I would think we should leave that a possibility, no?<br/><br/>Actually, the answer depends on how natural healing would otherwise take place. Eero, it sounds like you only accept natural healing under the same conditions as pool refreshment. In that case, can you e.g. refresh Reason, and also heal Reason-based Harm in the same scene?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417513/#Comment_417513" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T22:50:24+00:00" title="June 29, 2013 10:50PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Actually, the answer depends on how natural healing would otherwise take place. Eero, it sounds like you only accept natural healing under the same conditions as pool refreshment.

The difference in nuance is that I don't require a scene for natural healing, merely fictional positioning. That is, it is sufficient that a character has a moment of downtime e.g. between scenes for natural healing to take place. For this reason it doesn't usually happen exactly simultaneously with Pool refreshment, which always implies a scene.<br/><br/>If you find the effect of trading Pool for Harm positive, then by all means continue doing it. It doesn't work for me because it's mechanically too good: the right play in all situations is to immediately trade out your Harm, so as to prevent incoming Harm from bumping up (having what could have been Harm-2 become Harm-3 is such a serious mechanical expense that there are few reasons to risk it). This being the case, allowing free trading between these resources practically means that Harm is only something that becomes a concern once you're out of Pool. I prefer to have these two resources (Harm track and Pool) in a more ambiguous relationship, where characters might be tapped out on both or neither independently of the other. (A close reading of the Solar System explanation of Extended Conflict shows this philosophy in how ties in opposed rolls are treated; Pool is an integral, yet independent, resource.) Also, as I said, I find that BDtP takes long enough with the seven-step Harm ladder; with easy Pool trading that ladder grows to an average of 10+ hits before a character is out, which is quite a bit of dicing for no good reason.<br/><br/>(It should be noted, though, that removing Harm from the game altogether is a reasonable simplification. You could just assign all Harm directly as "Pool damage", and degree that characters who can't pay because they're out of Pool are forced out of conflict.)<br/><br/>Another positive factor in making natural healing a bit more bothersome is that it increases the utility of Ability-based healing, which I find somewhat more entertaining. For this reason I hold that natural healing should only happen in between scenes, and at most one step of Harm at a time. Thus you may heal over time, but you would heal faster if you had somebody check your injuries.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417676/#Comment_417676" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-02T15:17:08+00:00" title="July  2, 2013  3:17PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Given your discussion of initiative here (which aligns nicely with my own ideas on the subject), how do you handle initiative in your D&amp;D game?
