                    Okay, so imagine you have the basic conflict "Darth Vader is out to get you."  We trace that through the Empire Strikes Back.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning, Darth Vader is out to get Han and Leia.  But, y'know, he's out to get <i>everybody</i>.  And he's doing things through the intermediary of storm troopers.  And those troopers have sent out a scout droid.  Hundreds of scout droids, actually, to many different planets.  Vader is far away, shielded by many layers of intermediaries, and kept from immediate action against Han and Leia <i>specifically</i> by distance, ignorance and lack of focus.<br/>
<br/>
By the middle of the movie, all of those layers have been stripped away.  The scout droid leaves the picture, and the storm troopers make their appearance directly.  Vader is chasing the Milennium Falcon specifically.  Eventually, the conflict boils down to "Here's Vader, <b>right fuckin' here</b> in the dining room!  And he's looking for you, just you, you alone!  He's RIGHT THERE!"<br/>
<br/>
So I'm thinking that explicitly wrapping a conflict in these ... layers?  intermediaries? ... whatever, and then removing them piece by piece could be a great way to control pacing while still giving people a clear idea at all times of how a conflict should next appear in the scene.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a big problem though:  What the hell do you CALL those things?  The layers, the intermediaries, the whatevers?  What's the right word?                </div>

                            I think it boils down to how you want to use them.  Is the final confrontation an inevitable doom, hanging over the players like Damocles' Sword?  Or is it how far away an antagonist is, <em>and can be kept there</em>?  Because you might call the first one Threads of Fate and the other Buffers of Safety, depending.                        </div>

                            Personally, I like "layers", as in onions. And it's a nice concept.<br><br>Joshua's point about how they're used is a good one. In a murder mystery, the stages you pass through to get to the final antagonist are stepping stones: each clue gets you further. In a coming of age story, those stages are hurdles: you have to prove you're worthy before you progress. So, yes, those postponements of the conflict have different story functions.<br><br>It's also worth thinking about why you can't have Vader face Luke or Leia right there, right at the beginning. I mean, obviously, it would make for a short film; but also, it doesn't make dramatic sense. We need to see Luke prove himself, in all those stages, before he finally destroys the Death Star / faces Vader.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Well, for my money it's neither an inevitable doom <i>nor</i> something you (necessarily) work to avoid:  It's the next step in growing as a person.  It's the big dramatic confrontation with your own weaknesses and fears, and all that jazz.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, sometimes you want to avoid that, and that's a cool story too.  But I think that, often, players will want to drive toward it as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Not to get too terribly philosophical, but ... you know all those defense mechanisms that keep people from hurting you?  That great big, secure castle?  That's also your prison.  All that safety has to be compromised before you can be free to become something more than you've been before.<br/>
<br/>
That's less obvious with a conflict like "Vader is out to get you" (although ... yeah ... it's there too) but it's bleedingly obvious with a conflict like "I want to tell her I love her."  All those intermediaries ("Joey, you talk with Beth ... can you ask her whether Rachel ... uh ... talks about me?") that keep you safe also bar your path forward.<br/>
<br/>

Fair enough.  Didn't mean to derail.<br><br>Honestly, though, I think the word you're looking for will depend a lot on the context you want to use it in.  For a particular game, I'll bet the word will jump out - e.g.: for a murder mystery, it's "clues."  <br><br>As a storytelling device, I think the word you're looking for is "complications": the things that go between the beginning of the story and the climax.<br/><br/>In the psycho-fictional context you're alluding to, something like shells, walls, keeps, layers (of armor), delays, stays, stops, or harrows.<br/><br/>That enough of a <i>mea culpa?</i> </br></br></br></br></div>

                            From how you've described that varation in conflict immediacy, I'm tending more towards words that describe the relative position of conflict and the protagonists, rather than words that describe the things/whatever that separate the two.  Would directly describing the degree of conflict immediacy work for you, or do you prefer to describe the stuff keeping them apart?  I'm not sure I'm explaining well, but what I'm getting at is that you've asked for names of things holding the points of conflict apart, and I was wondering if it would be better to think in terms of the distance between those points of conflict?<br/><br/>Claire                        </div>

                            Claire:  I get what you're saying.  Leastwise, I think I do.<br/><br/>I was thinking of explicitly <i>listing</i> the things that stand between them, and then having the conflict resolution have side-effects that (among other things) gave players the ability to change and remove those intermediaries.<br/><br/>So, like, "Frodo wants to defy Sauron and destroy his Ring" then gets modified with "He's a helluva long way from Mount Doom" and "The enemy doesn't know where the ring is" and "Frodo's hobbity goodness protects him from the ring's corrupting influence."  Those are the reasons that, when he sets out from Rivendell, things haven't really come to a head yet.  Oh yeah ... "Frodo is protected by a circle of companions."  That one's clearly gotta go :-)<br/><br/>Then, you get to have a conflict on the plains of Mordor, and if the stakes go <i>one way</i> then you remove "You're a helluva long way from Mount Doom" but if they go the other way then maybe you remove "The enemy doesn't know where the ring is" instead ... or maybe you change "Frodo's hobbity goodness" to "Samwise's strength protects Frodo from the ring's corrupting influence."  Or ... y'know ... whatever.<br/><br/>Best case scenario, you eventually end up with Frodo exposed before the eye of Sauron, fighting the ring's full corruption, at the very brink of the fires of its unmaking.  I mean ... it <b>has to</b> come to that, if you want to really destroy the damn thing.  But the players probably care very, very much what order, and at what junctures, those intermediaries are removed.<br/><br/>Not-so-great scenario, you get rid of all the things that were really troubling you (the distance from Mount Doom, ferinstance) but not the "helpful" impediments that make it impossible for you to reach the right moment of crisis.  Maybe Sam throws the ring in, and really, that's just ... it's not enough, in some meaningful way.<br/><br/>Worst-case scenario:  Frodo loses his will and Sauron finds him, and they just basically totally get screwed ... now the things interfering in the quest to destroy the ring are more like "All of the good people are dead" and "Frodo <b>likes</b> being a toy of the dark powers," and stuff like that.  Things can still come to a head (as Gollum proves) from those dark directions, but it's a much nastier story.<br/><br/>So ... I'm getting a little talky (because it's late at night here, and I ramble).  The way I've been thinking about it is easier to put into words if I describe each of the steps of distance independently, but I <b>do think</b> that you could talk about Frodo's quest having three steps of "gap," and then talk about "closing the gap" ... to talk about removing those elements in the language of changing the overall degree of conflict immediacy.  Is that what you're describing?                        </div>

                            Yup, that's what I was getting at.  It sounds better to go with a term describing those things, rather than the relationship, because you're looking to directly manipulate them.<br/><br/>What about Complications?  That could describe the reasons why that big ultimate confrontation is not happening <b>right now</b>, and as they're removed it both gets closer and changes the current situation.  And the idea of complications resonates with the teen romance genre for me, where everything can feel so complicated.<br/><br/>Claire                        </div>

                            My two cents' worth, straight from my current project: since I'm working on a game that uses an anime-series structure, all the characters have goals, based on how far off they are, how difficult they are, or when we might reasonably expect them to be resolved. So: situational (i.e. current conflict), episode, arc, and season/series.<br><br>To go back to the Star Wars analogy, as an anime series, The Empire Strikes Back might be considered a handful of episodes, so some of the Vader stuff might be arc goals. I suspect "Defeat Darth Vader" might be a season/series goal for Luke, although that likely transforms into "Redeem my father" during Return of the Jedi. <br><br>Also, small goals should build toward larger goals. So if Bobby has the ultimate goal of getting Suzie to fall in love with him, there might be smaller goals of finding out if she likes him, asking her out on a date, declaring his love for her, etc. Does Misery Bubblegum suggest a structure that allows you to delay certain conflicts or break them down into smaller ones?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthew Gandy</cite>Does Misery Bubblegum suggest a structure that allows you to delay certain conflicts or break them down into smaller ones?</blockquote>Misery Bubblegum runs start to finish (including character- and world-generation) within an hour or two, and has no rules continuity from past sessions or to future ones.  So I really don't need anything beyond <i>episode</i> level conflicts, though I certainly see where they would be an important distinction in other systems.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Is this specific to Misery Bubblegum?

The amount of input and focus I'm getting is really terrific, and I <i>am</i> grateful, even if I'm not always good at expressing it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Actually the thing that got me thinking is the "High School Corridors" comment above. Why not Hurdles? As somebody proposed. Taken as literal, they're associated with the High School as the track event. Taken as metaphor, they're the things that you have to hop over in order to get to the goal.<br/>
<br/>
Makes sense to me in this context.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, BTW, Judson, that's a very important point you're making. Also instead of HP, it's more like AP or Action Points from Hero Quest. Note that we've done extended contests in HQ that do things like this. And, yes, until you get down to zero you can't declare that you're going after Vader (or he you). This ablation is precisely "plot hit points" in effect.<br/>
<br/>
I know you already have a system, but just sayin'.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>And, yes, until you get down to zero you can't declare that you're going after Vader (or he you). This ablation is precisely "plot hit points" in effect.</blockquote>Yeah.  I love the effect of that ... particularly that the final confrontation doesn't need to be the biggest, the flashiest.  In fact, sometimes it makes the most sense for the <b>final</b> confrontation to be very small, very touching ... when the flash and outrage and circumstance were all just complications on the road to the core thing.<br><br>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kare_Kano" rel="nofollow">Kare Kano</a>, Miyazawa tries to tell Soichiro that she loves him, and it's hard, so hard.  And the whole thing is layered with complications:  Her cunning plans, and her manipulative skills, and her strength and her self-restraint, and his patience.  In the end, I think even the idea of "words" is a circumstance that stands as an intermediary between them.<br><br>After all of the conflicts that she wins and (mostly) loses, peeling back these layers, the climactic moment of that arc is that she quietly reaches out and takes his hand.  Just that.  But <b>because</b> of all of the conflicts that she's won and (mostly) lost, that's all that's needed.  The hard work was in getting there.<br><br>And in the end, after all the fear and danger and distance, the storm-troopers and space-ships and planets, have been peeled away, Luke only has to drop his weapon and say "No, I will not turn to the dark side.  I am a Jedi, like my father before me."  And because he's made it to that place, saying it is all it takes to make it true.<br><br>God, I love that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hey Tony, I'm not sure if the complexity of the layers scale and increase, but if your initial example is the standard, you could also view them through the lens of dramatic/cinematic acts.  It's terminology everybody gets - if the rules say Vader can't lop off hands until act three, nobody is going to be confused.<br><br>ACT ONE:  Vader is searching<br>ACT TWO:  Vader is finding<br>ACT THREE:  Vader is lopping off hands                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            In software we call stuff like that Abstraction Layers.<br><br/>Maybe that's too long and unwieldy, but its more helpful to me than just 'layers'. You say "layers of a conflict" and I'll be considering the emotional layer, the physical layer, and so forth even if you call those "aspects" or whatever. What "Abstraction Layer" says (again, to me) is that this is something that makes the two things less directly about eachother - The conflict is with Vader, but it has Abstraction Layers of Stormtroopers, Probe Droids, and so forth<br/><br/>LotR is about A Bad Dude who Wants his Ring Back, but the Abstraction Layers between him and the ring are Hobbits, Kingdoms of Men, Meddling Wizards, Gollum, etc.  <br/><br/>Hamlet wants to show the world that his uncle killed his father, but he uses the Actors and their play as an Abstraction Layer because he's unable or unwilling to directly confront his father. <br/><br/>Am I way out in left field here?                        </br></div>

                            Hiya!<br/>
<br/>
I'll play the Egri fanboy and suggest a term borrowed from the "Art of Dramatic Writing": basically what you're talking about is <i>rising conflict</i>. So perhaps all you need is to call one of those things a <i>rise in conflict</i>, or just a <i>rise</i> (but DitV-fans might get confused with rise and raises).<br/>
<br/>
Since I don't quite understand what you're looking for, here's what I get if I dig down deeper into the "Conflict" section of Lajos Egri's manual. You could find the choice morsel in here, depending on what exactly it is you're looking for.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Rising conflict is the result of a clear-cut premise and well-orchestrated, three-dimensional characters, among whom unity is strongly established.</div>
</blockquote>
Reading on, I find that he considers that a rising conflict must reveal the character's innermost feelings, the "unity of opposition" between antagonist and protagonist, the position in which they stand and the one they are aiming to obtain. So perhaps, a <i>reveal</i> is what you might want?<br/>
<br/>
Conflict is also composed of <i>movements</i> (characters don't repeatedly say the same things) yielding a <i>transition</i> between two stages (friendship to hate; persecuted to oppressor; etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Egri also suggest that to keep the spectator interested, upcoming conflicts need to be <i>foreshadowed</i>. So if these obstacles only serve to prepare for the final conflict, they could be considered as a technique for foreshadowing.<br/>
<br/>
He also talks about <i>points of attack</i>, how you actually approach and engage a potential conflict. This might be particularly interesting in the context of RPGs, since those prepared obstacles only serve as a starting point for a conflict (or not if you steer away from them, effectively choosing another point of attack).<br/>
<br/>
Also, he sees three parts in a conflict: <i>crisis</i>, <i>climax</i> and <i>resolution</i>. Depending on what scale you want to consider the conflicts, each obstacle could serve one of those functions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very roughly, that's the terms he uses. Of course, color-wise they're pretty feeble. My 2 cts, signing off.                        </div>

Maybe I'm just being dense here, but why not have two different words for the two different things?  Might they not end up having some mechanical differences in the end anyway?

                            Hi.  I answered this topic a bit differently in the Gamecraft thread <a href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?p=2555#2555" rel="nofollow"><b>Conflicts, pacing and immediacy</b></a>.  <br><br>There, I was commenting that simply escalating immediacy wasn't a good general picture of a developing conflict even for action plots.  I don't necessarily have a good term, but I'd like to explore what you're trying for in the first place.  <br><br>While the term "Hoops" might be a good expression, the image of jumping through hoops to get to the villain doesn't sound very positive to me.  It makes the process sounds like simply delaying the conflict, holding back from things.  Ideally, I don't think that should be true.  The process of going through the plot should change what the conflict is about, not just hold it back.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I <b><i>think</i></b> I get it, but here is my last attempt to make sure I do...since to go any further risks derailment.  You are talking about defining Issue X along with necessarily plot coupons A, B, and C which are explicitly defined during pre-play and must be collected before the issue itself can be dealt with (possibly either sequentially or serially, not clear on that point).

                            Eric:  Uh ... not exactly.  Okay, example time:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">John is playing Victor, a young man who wants to admit his love to Gina, the fetching bookworm who works in the library.  So the central conflict is "Make a connection with Gina."  Then the other players start piling on Complications.  First there is "Gina's reticence," and then there is "Victor's popularity," and on top of it all there is "Victor's friends."<br/>
<br/>
So the first time there is an instance of this conflict, it is mediated by all three of those factors.  Say, for instance, that Victor convinces one of his friends, who knows Gina, to invite her to one of their beach parties.  This works out ... poorly.  Victor manages to be ham-handed enough that he grievously offends Gina, and she lashes out at him verbally, smacking him down pretty savagely as a worthless pretty-boy with no ambition beyond getting drunk.  But!  On the positive side, Gina's player, in addition to winning the conflict, gets the rights to remove or change a complication, and decides to take "Gina's reticence" out of action entirely.<br/>
<br/>
So, the <i>next time</i> there is an instance of this conflict, it is mediated only by Victor's popularity and his friends.  Gina's reticence is no longer either a driving force or a barrier.  Victor tries to show that there's more to him than just popularity, courting the scorn of the school by publicly apologizing to Gina.  But he gets hammered <b>again</b>, this time by the GM, who arranges events such that it looks like Victor is only talking to Gina in order to convince her to help him steal answers for next weeks big exam.  The GM chortles and changes "Victor's popularity" to "Grievous misunderstanding."  Oh, evil GM.<br/>
<br/>
Victor has to clear his name.  He goes after <i>yet another</i> conflict in this sequence.  This one he's not even present for (as he need not be, given that he has his friends as intermediaries).  Through one of his friends, he manages to get convincing information to Gina to show that their misunderstanding was just that.  He eliminates "Grievous misunderstanding," and the make a connection of sorts (though not the deeper, more dramatically resolving connection that will occur if he can remove the last barrier and talk to her alone, without his friends in tow), bringing Gina into his social circle.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, at this point John as a player is running out of resources.  He can't push matters any further, and can't get that last conflict that he needs.  So Victor and Gina have a connection of sorts, but they're only friends in a group of friends, and (for now) that's where things have to stay.</div>
</blockquote>
So, yeah ... the complications are targets that people are aiming at, but they're also the structure of the conflict as it is played out in each iteration.                        </div>

                            Tony, one of your earlier posts gave me goosebumps. I was thinking of Kare Kano in the context of this discussion, before you mentioned it, particularly the episode you reference. Crazy!<br><br>Then I read your most recent post. I realize this is only an example, but I see a distinct problem here: Victor always "loses." I put that in quotes as I suspect that Victor's player is *successful* - he gets to remove or change obstacles between Victor and Gina - but the cost is always pain. If this is the case, then what happens when the player *fails*? More obstacles crop up, pushing him further from his goal? If this is not the case, then can you give an example of "winning" that involves less pain? Or is success always at some cost?                        </br></br></div>

                            Matthew:  Hrm?  I mean, it's only one example, so I didn't show a similar one where somebody handily trounces obstacle after obstacle, proceeding happily toward their goal (the Baron's plot in <i>The Cat Returns</i>, for instance, goes just like that and I don't mind it a bit), but even in this example ... didn't Victor win the third instance of the conflict, where he cleared his name?  All of the following are possible: Win every conflict and resolve the main issue, win every conflict and fail to resolve the main issue, lose every conflict and resolve the main issue, lose every conflict and fail to resolve the main issue.<br/>
<br/>
There's whole other sections of how I intend to use the system, but I'll give a rough sketch of what I intend in <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> specifically:  You will have opportunities to give dice of "your" color to other people, by having your character think or talk about theirs (whatever the relationship).  Those dice will help the person you gave them to in order to <b>win</b> conflicts, but they (and your own dice) will help you, always you, in order to <b>modify</b> the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
So how often you <i>win</i> will depend on how you play your own character plus how other people talk about you.  How often you modify the circumstances will depend on how you play your own character plus how you talk about other people.  Playing really well is good for both, but there are limits to how far that can take you.  Being intertangled in other people's lives and being part of a network of opinion also helps you, but only part of that is under your control, and if it's lopsided (i.e. people think more about you than you think about them or you think more about others than they think about you) then you're going to get an imbalance where suffering and dramatic progress go hand in hand.<br/>
<br/>
Which is ... already way more about the Misery Bubblegum system than I intended to dump into this thread.  If people want to hear more, I do have some outstanding design questions (particularly about whether to do zero-sum game or cooperation-friendly on some of these rolls) that I could decant off into another thread.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  And, so far, there are no rules for adding complicationss.  Because play proceeds over a limited time-frame with limiting resources, there's no need to punish people by adding complications.  Not removing them is punishment enough.  In a race against the clock, being forced to stand still for a while is as bad as going the wrong way.                        </div>

                            Alright.  I get it now.<br><br>It does seem like they function primarily as roadblocks, obstacles, things that must be overcome, especially since they are thrown up by the other players...which I really like by the way.  If you want to go this way, of everything mentioned so far, I like "hurdles" the best.  It doesn't have that magic discussion-stopping vibe to it, but it seems fitting.<br><br>On the other hand, you may want to look at them, as someone else put it, "stepping stones" to the conflict.  There you have "steps", "rungs", etc.  These don't seem to sing either.<br><br>There is also "check" which while probably too subtle, sort of encorporates both.  A check stops something until it is overcome and it is also a step you accomplish as you "check" off the item.<br><br>- Eric<br><br>(Edited for typos...several times.

                            Walls are pretty impassible. And going with the idea that they are junctures I was thinking more doors. Adam had gates above.<br/>
<br/>
But how about Gateways? The gateway is locked until overcome. And then it's a passage to the next action.<br/>

                            Gateways is a pretty good term but not sure how it fits with the color of the game.  Hmmmm.....

                            John:  It's my front-runner right now, because it conveys something of the twin issues of "What structures the conflict" and "Things you get past."  My main problem is that it also has connotations for <i>hundreds of other things</i>.  It's certainly a fine label, in the same way that (for instance) "Action" is a fine label for the succession of turns in a competitive Librarian game ... but people who read the label and thought "Wow, it'll be packed with ACTION!" would be misconstruing the game because of the word, and I'm worried that "complications" may do the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, my plan is to play the game with "Complications" and see whether a better word occurs to me, or anyone at my table.                        </div>
