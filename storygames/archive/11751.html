To kick things off, I will define/describe it as best as I'm able.<br/>\n<br/>\nRitual space is a clearly defined location and period of time in which a given activity takes place. This doesn't mean that it's always the same place or always the same time. Rather, it's a clearly defined instance of place and time. The purpose of this is to set the activity apart, give it an other-ness. What this should accomplish is to help remove distractors from the participants minds, and to provide a sort of 'safe place'. It's an aid to focus and openness. How this is accomplished varies greatly. A few things appear to be common, however. The first is a definite beginning point. Some action makes it clear to all present that the activity has begun, that the ritual space is open. The second thing is a clear ending point, some action which makes it clear that the activity is done, that the ritual space is closed. The third thing is a bit harder to define, but it is something which constantly reminds the participants that this place and time are separate, and it should last from the opening to the closing of the ritual space.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal experiences with ritual space and gaming predate my knowledge of the concept. I had begun a game of Vampire: the Masquerade with friends. Either shortly after beginning, or shortly before, I bought some crushed velvet and had it sewn into a table cloth. I bought a couple of tallish silver-tone candlesticks, and a handful of long black tapers, and a couple of marble platters to place under the candles to help catch the melting wax. Each session began with the setting of the sun, which I would describe as I lit the candles, usually in somewhat overblown prose. We would play until we ran out of time or hit a good stopping point, and the vamps would scatter to their respective dens to shelter from the dawn. I would describe the fading of night and the rising sun, also in melodramatic prose. Then I would blow out the candles.*<br/>\n<br/>\nThese were not the very best gaming experiences I've ever had, but they come very, very close. Sidebar conversations were fairly minimal, as were distractions from play. Everyone enjoyed themselves, and kept coming back week after week. They told their friends about the game, who would then ask if they could play. I had the hardest time saying no, so that at the height of the game, I had twelve PCs. One night, almost all of the players showed up. It was crazy and exhausting, but the preternatural focus of that game made it doable, and somehow even more awesome. The ritual trappings seemed corny when I thought of them, and they seem cheesy looking back, but I cannot deny the difference in that game from every other game I've ever played in or run. It may be simple coincidence, that focused players, time and ability to focus, and engaging fiction all dovetailed over the course of that campaign. But I suspect it was not. After that campaign broke up, I never seriously tried to do that again. I've had better gaming experiences since then with no memorable instances of ritual. But I can't shake the belief that the ritual aspects were a large part of what made that game so successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeguey Baker, I believe, was the first to talk about ritual space in gaming over on the Forge. She talked about how she used techniques from counseling sessions she'd done, and how it helped to create an environment of trust and openness. I think that such a space is essential for exploration of sensitive or uncomfortable topics in a mature manner. In a flip way, it's like "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas." You can remember what happened and how you felt, but the actual feelings and happenings happened in a separate place. It allows for more intimacy within the space while lessening the discomfort that frequently follows unexpected intimacy. I cannot speak for Ben Lehman, but I think Polaris is intended to take advantage of this same concept, where you can tell earnest stories of tragedy without feeling self-conscious about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint of Discussion #1: If my understanding differs from yours, or if you think I'm just completely wrong, please chime in. My definition is taken from a mishmash of what I remember of Meguey's posts, and my own understanding explicit ritual space in other venues. I associate ritual space very closely with the concepts of IWNAY and Playing Passionately.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint of Discussion #2: Talk about your experiences with ritual space. Describe the specific techniques you used in as much detail as you wish. Talk about what effect it had on your gaming. Feel free to talk about either explicit, intentional use of ritual space, or habits that formed over time that ended up creating ritual space organically.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint of Discussion #3: What else can such techniques help with? What sort of play might they be harmful to, if any? What are the pros and cons of any specific techniques mentioned, or that you've seen?<br/>\n<br/>\n<sub>* frequently the blowing out of the candles would be followed by a light cry of pain from one of my friends, as I would almost invariably spatter him with a little hot wax when I did so. I didn't do it on purpose, but it happened often enough that the closing of the session is associated with the sound in my memories.</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262608/#Comment_262608" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T17:49:49+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  5:49PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...really?

Might have started when we were playing weekends in cabins without electricity.<br>\n<br>\nIt does make a world of difference, now, but isn't it a pretty widely held belief that any ceremony gets stronger with repetition? I doubt you can just write a ritual space into the game rules, and turn it on like a switch; you would have to tap into elements previously established with the participants - like counseling techniques - or try to appropriate religious/occult elements without breaking them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zartes" title="Zartes"><img alt="Zartes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zartes">Zartes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262650/#Comment_262650" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T03:04:52+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  3:04AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Myself and some friends have, at different times, toyed with ideas about this. the two that spring to mind were having opening and closing credits for the games, and on one occasion, getting everybody to do a little yoga before we sat down, to ensue they were all chilled out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262656/#Comment_262656" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T04:34:57+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  4:34AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading.

As I said, my own experiences weren't done with anything in mind other than "setting the mood". I imagine that's the same sort of thing your DM had in mind too, Anders. Whether the liminal space (to steal the term from Matthijs) was intended or not, it happens. Of course, ritual doesn't have to be serious, either. When you're sitting down to enjoy time with friends and play a game, you can't afford to be *too* serious, really. Maybe your ritual might include everyone telling a joke before play starts, to "get it out of their system".<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to think of it, a TRoS game I ran had elements of ritual as well, though I didn't really think of it until today. The ritual involved one of the players summarizing the events of the previous session before play, and then me invoking the actual play with the phrase "When last we left our insipid heroes..." sometimes followed or even preceded by a brief discussion of whether or not the PCs had become "intrepid" yet. At the end of the session, I would have the players roll a die, then ask them a question from a list, based on their roll. The questions included things like: "What would you like to see happen next session?" or "What was your favorite thing about this session?" Even then, familiar with the idea of ritual space, I didn't intentionally use it as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome closing questions/comments to individuals:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfT,<br/>\n<br/>\nIs your ritual pretty much the same thing done in the same way every time, or is it just a casual time/game time divide? Does your group consciously think of this as the routine? What do you think would happen if people showed up and the GM was like "Okay, sit down and let's get started," without the casual time?<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthijs,<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't say always, but I would concede that whenever a game session actually *works* that that is probably true. Sometimes we utterly fail to establish any sort of liminal space, and usually those games are fragmented and frustrating to almost everyone involved, even if you could technically say that you "played".<br/>\n<br/>\nMark,<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think ritual space techniques might work with your group if they weren't overly serious or formal? With the thoughts that we always have some sort of routine to create liminal spaces, can you think of any things that currently happen with your group that might count as ritual techniques? If so, is there anything you can think of that would build on those in a natural sort of way?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnders,<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you familiar with Polaris? I think it does exactly what you say won't work; It codifies ritual into the mechanics of play. I've only played a single session, but it seems to me like it would work out alright. Is there any particular reason that you think that previously established elements must be present for ritual to work?<br/>\n<br/>\nJarrah,<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds interesting. In other discussions, Graham Walmsley talks about doing voice warm-ups at cons. Your ideas seem similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262734/#Comment_262734" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T10:05:48+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 10:05AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 10:06AM by Destriarch.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>The rest of the game also uses ritual techniques - ouija board, dream visions.</blockquote>\nPoint of order, Oujia Boards have only been ritualised in recent years. They were originally created as a kind of board game and had nothing at all to do with contacting the dead. However over the years a whole load of folklore has sprung up around the use of the Ouija board, which at one time was no more than a harmless party game. And that's one of my points too: I don't want to see RPGs go the same way.<br><br>Personally I do not like the use of the term 'ritual' anywhere near my role-playing, except as a purely mythical element of the story. If the characters get involved in a ritual, that's fine. If the players have to perform a ritual, that's where things start getting iffy. There's one game, 'The Everlasting', that actually provides a spooky and unnervingly authentic magic ritual for the beginning of play, and that suggestion in particular gave me the creeps. But let me outline my misgivings more clearly.<br><br>Firstly, there's the problem of misunderstanding from outside the hobby. We've all heard about BADD and its idiotic claims that D&amp;D promotes witchcraft. If we start putting rituals into games, we might as well be admitting it's true.<br><br>Secondly, there's the question of intent. Some genuine practitioners would say that by ritualising the game you are in fact turning it into some kind of spell; you're using it as a means to generate energy. At the end of the game, where does the energy go? By providing a 'dismissal' at the end you're effectively sending away the energy you've created. But has the entire thing been formulated properly? Are the usual precautions in place? In a proper magical ritual for instance, there are usually precautions that must be taken when entering or exiting the ritual area to prevent energy from escaping uncontrolled. For that matter, where's your grounding ritual? Vital in magical practices to bring the participants back down to earth and remind them it's the real world, but not always obvious because it's the precise opposite of the other forms of ritual - the magicians (or whatever) do ordinary things like chat and eat some food to remind themselves that the magic is over and they should come down now.<br><br>I'm no huge believer in magic, but those who do might question how safe the rituals used in a game are, especially when the participants see the entire exercise as a game not a serious endeavour. And when you've got both the rabid religious fanatics AND the neo-pagans against you, who's going to defend you?<br><br>Thirdly, I worry about the psychological effect upon the players. It has been pointed out that ritual can be used in psychological healing and councilling, but these are conducted by trained professionals who know how to control the events they create. What if someone became so fixated on the ritual that whenever they heard the wrong sequence of words they suddenly snapped into character?

We already have enough crazies and psychos generating negative press for the hobby, I don't want to see a practice become prevalent that might create more.<br><br>For this reason I would only play a game with a ritualistic element if that ritual was a) not called a ritual, b) contained no ritualised elements intended to bring on a state of altered consciousness, or c) that resembled genuine magical rituals in any way, shape or form.

(For the record, it was "Also sprach Zarathustra" done on the kazoo, which proves that you can find anything on the Internet.)

I took some of the ritual lessons I learned from reading Meguey and from playing <i>Polaris</i> and put them into play in the design of that game. A couple highlights:\n<ol>\n<li>There's a formal opening and closing of the game, called "Raising the Curtain" and "Lowering the Curtain", because it's an improv play. Each is performed in just about the same way: the players gather around the place that has been designated as Mara's grave. Then the Director (kinda the GM) reads a passage from the burial service from the Book of Common Prayer.<br><br>Each player carries a flower, which is a symbol of the grief that his character carries. At the beginning of the game, each player writes down his Grief, which is something in the <i>player's</i> life that caused him sorrow, grief, or pain. Then he attaches the paper with his Grief to the flower. During the game, the player carries the flower. If his character decides that it's time to move past his grief, the player puts down the flower at the graveside and gives a brief out-of-character monologue about the Grief that he wrote down.</br></br></li>\n</ol>\nThe ritual elements of <i>A Flower for Mara</i> are vitally important to allow the players the proper space to address some really heavy issues.<br><br>(If you're interested, there are links to actual game play footage <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/2008/02/18/a-flower-for-mara-ap-videos-part-1/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/2008/02/19/a-flower-for-mara-ap-videos-part-2/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

The two words are pretty much synonimous anyway, but really I more wanted to draw attention to the dangers of getting too ritualistic. Just dimming the lights, sticking on some candles and saying 'OK, let's start!' is no problem, but then again... hold on, I know what, I'll show you the kind of 'ritual' that worries me. This is an excerpt from 'the Everlasting' that I mentioned before:<br/><br/>"All participants should start by agreeing to start since the ceremony requires everyone to be quiet, serious and attentive. If the participants are not going to take the ceremony serious (sic) then it will hold no value in setting apart the legend-making.<br/><br/>If candles are used, one candle should be placed before the Guide. If enough are available each participant should have a candle placed before them.<br/><br/>Guide: Here we gather, we who seek admittance into the Secret World of magic and wonder, we who seek entry into the worlds of legend, we who shall be eldritch for our allotted time.<br/><br/>[The Guide lights the candle]<br/><br/>Everyone: Before us lie the mysteries of the universe. We shall seek the light and cast off the darkness. We shall seek adventure and heroic deeds."<br/><br/>It goes on for about three times as long in a similar vein. Now, anyone accidentally bursting in on a regular game of D&amp;D might be a little perturbed, but if they came in on something like that? *shudder* No. No way. So I hope you can see why I'm against the use of the term 'Ritual' and the use of rituals similar to this one, especially when people start throwing around terms like Banishing, Purifying and Summoning.<br/><br/>Perhaps there's a better word, like 'Routine' or 'Preparation' that doesn't have the disturbing esoteric subtext? I mean, if we're not careful we'll be 'Initiating' new players next!<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262745/#Comment_262745" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T10:33:34+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 10:33AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Ashok, I consider role-playing in itself a ritual activity.

The psychological effect upon the participants should not be dismissed merely because they are not taking it seriously. The actual act of role-playing is different because you use your character as a proxy.

For example Voodoo. The participants in a voodoo ritual basically take on the attributes of one of the Loa, and act as that deity for the remainder of the ritual. What I don't want to see is Role-Playing being confused with religion, or spawning new religions (stranger in a strange land, anyone?

It's definitely a routine, and I'm sure a lot of us think of it that way.  The thing I notice that seems to be the most critical is that it's the GM (or whoever's running the game) who waits until everyone's gotten their social chatter out of the way and is ready, and then announces to everyone that we're starting now.<br/><br/>This is, I'm sure, partly practical...if the GM isn't ready, the game suffers, so don't rush the GM.  Also, the GM is already paying attention to the players, and will probably notice when it's a good time to stop talking and start playing before anyone else does.   There's probably also an element of respect there, in that everyone is agreeing to grant the GM the authority to make calls like "Time to start the game" and "The target number is 20" and what have you.<br/><br/>When we haven't had that casual time before the game, it has been a BIG PROBLEM, because everyone does their chitchat during the game instead, where it disrupts everything.  We usually need fifteen to thirty minutes to get caught up with each other about our lives and share whatever interesting news we've heard, and we're going to be taking that time at the beginning whether or not the game is started.  If doing that up front and then specifically saying "Let's start playing" when it's over counts as a ritual -- and it might, albeit of a very casual and haphazard variety -- then it's one that our group absolutely requires for a great game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262800/#Comment_262800" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T12:38:16+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 12:38PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 12:38PM by Destriarch.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Routine!

The introductory one draws on a set of deeply ground in ritual phrases - "once upon a time", "long ago" and so on. Still, I think I might be wrong in supposing that ritual depends on repetition. But I'll hang on to the idea that it needs to draw some sort of weight from somewhere else - some mode of discourse the players are prepared to allow themselves to be influenced by.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that think about it, I remember claiming something similar in a discussion on a norwegian board - that ritual is binding and limiting, because of the need for repetition and conformity. But someone else pointed out something that made me realize I was thinking of ritual from an "apollonian" perspective, when ritual can also be dionysian - wild, inspired, out of control, provoking startlingly alien and unexpected acts. So, no, not necessarily repetition - that's just one of a handful of clever little mindfucks that can be used to unlock our brains and make us think, feel, act and react differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see Destriarch's worry about effects of rituals on participants, but I can't see that the effect would be any better or worse than the usual drama of social interaction. More interesting and novel, but not inherently more risky. After all, social interaction is all ritual, if you look at it in a slightly awkward light :) Sure, some rituals raise the stakes, but only while the participants play along.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for What People Might Think: Fuck'em if they can't take a joke.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, I understand your concern, and I share it, but it feels like taking anything resembling heed of people like that would somehow be physically painful to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262867/#Comment_262867" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T15:28:25+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  3:28PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AfT,<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, then it definitely seems like (routine that creates liminal space) to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsh,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm largely with Matthijs, here:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I've pretty much made up my mind not to let my design be influenced by the potential preconceptions or prejudice of people I've never met.

I refuse to let them affect me any more than I absolutely have to. On the flip side, I'll respect your qualms. Would it help you to mentally replace the term "ritual" with what I put in the parentheses above?<br/>\n<br/>\nThing is though, you never have to use the terminology. You never have to use occult-style techniques. Ritual phrases like in Polaris, and the overtly mystical ritual you described from "The Everlasting" are exceptions that are specifically trying to set and maintain a certain mood, completely aside from the liminal space they create. Read my last post above, where I talk about the rituals we used in the TRoS game. A session recap, a goofy opening phrase, and a sort of Quality Assurance survey at the end. If someone walked in on any of that, they're not even going to notice. The book with the big ass sword on the cover, and all the funny shaped dice on the table might get their dander up, but not the ritual elements themselves. The important things are as I said above: A clearly defined beginning, a clearly defined end, and something to remind you that you're in a different state during play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis latter thing, the reminder of the presence of ritual space, is probably the least strongly defined thing in my mind, but I still think it's important. In the V:tM game, it was the presence of the candles, the red velvet tablecloth, and the darkened room. In Polaris, it's the constant reminder of the ritual phrases. There wasn't anything that recalls itself to my mind in the TRoS game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth,<br/>\n<br/>\nThat definitely sounds intriguing. I remember hearing about it at GenCon in '08, but I was purposefully ignoring a lot of games, as I was trying to not become too scattered. A Flower for Mara was one of those games, specifically because my main preference (though not the only thing I enjoy) is adventure gaming. I'll take a look at the footage at some point in the near future.<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos,<br/>\n<br/>\nA ritual is definitely a bit different than habit or routine. The thing that differentiates it, at least to me, is the effect; Ritual should create a separate space in the minds of the participants. That is the primary thing about ritual in gaming, to me. It may have other uses for gaming; I dunno. That's part of what I'd like to see discussed. I know it has other uses in things other than gaming, such as magick and religion. Those I don't really care to discuss here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262915/#Comment_262915" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T00:15:23+00:00" title="March 19, 2010 12:15AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anders, yeah, I think that some rituals get added symbolic weight from the players' expectations.

As Ashok points out, ouija boards as we know them are actually a kids' toy made by the Parker Brothers. They didn't originate with serious occultism (although Crowley did use one, that was after they were commercially available in stores, AFAIK). Still, bringing it into the game gives the game a different "feel" - it resonates with the characters' pseudo-scientific, often semi-occult explorations. And even though most people will say rational things like "it's just a kids' toy", there's still that tiny association the board has with the occult in people's minds that gives play a little extra edge.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262922/#Comment_262922" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T02:26:14+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  2:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2010 2:27AM by Destriarch.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regardless of anyone's personal feelings on the subject, I do strongly feel that a GM has to be careful what groups he introduces a ritualised format to and how, to avoid upsetting or alienating players.

In another sense, <i>every</i> game seems to involve ritual. For example, when we talk and laugh and eat together, that's an important part of the game session.<br><br>So I'm unsure whether we should define ritual widely, so that everyone's game involves a ritual, or narrowly, so that ritual is a Special Thing.<br><br>I'm wary of game texts that impose ritual. This ranges from definite ritual, such as the Beast Hunters handshake, to more generally specified ritual, such as "Sit down comfortably and ensure you've got plenty of snacks to hand". Often, I feel the game designer is imposing their ritual on ours. Usually, the rituals of our play group win. Even if the game text tells us to sit in arm chairs with snacks, we sit around the dining table and break for dinner.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262937/#Comment_262937" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T04:58:05+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  4:58AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I was clear enough with what definition I'm working from. I think it falls into the middle ground, neither too narrow as to only include specific elements, nor too wide as to include simple habit and routine. It has to create a separateness in which the activity of gaming takes place. There are other definitions, but I think that they're not particularly useful for gaming applications. I could be wrong, and I invite anyone to explain to me how I am, but until then, that's what I'm using as a requisite to call something ritual.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are you wary of definite ritual? If it's part of the game's procedure, it seems like it would be something integral to the experience. The generalized stuff you used in your example doesn't seem like ritual at all to me, though, so much as a conversational device. It's just shorthand for "get ready to play the game, be comfortable."<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to class.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263039/#Comment_263039" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T17:43:19+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  5:43PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the problem is the concept of seperateness<br><br>all that stuff that just gets people ready to play the game and be comfortible, also creates a seperateness.

When people stop yammering because I yelled Chop Chop, something made them stop, I'd be inclined to say its their state of mind. It doesn't just happen randomly (people just dont get in this way of being with out me yelling chop chop or generally being conditioned to it in general) so its a result of the ritual (of me yelling chop chop)<br><br>I kinda get what you saying , that sometimes when your blowing out candles and passing arround challices of blood you have a special kind of state of mind that makes you particularly receptive to the experiance or makes you extra appropiate to the game or what not. <br><br>I just don't see anyway of differentiating the state of mind (ChopChop) from (Chalice of blood). All the light the candles and everyone eat a cookie seems to me to be just another way of saying "get ready to play the game, be comfortable".

This is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the big things I'm seeing from examples and anecdotes is that ritual is either explicit or formed gradually. Note that explicit doesn't necessarily mean intentional. My candles and table-cloth weren't intended to create a separateness, at least not consciously. But I was explicitly trying to do <i>something.</i> The sort that you're talking about, and that Anders mentioned above, as well as some of what I was doing in the TRoS game all seem to be of the gradually formed stuff. I didn't start doing the pre-play recap and post-play questionnaire up front. The pre-play recap came as a way to remind us all what happened last, and get us on the same page. The post-play questionnaire was me trying to further get a feel for what was going right and wrong. The fact that they ended up forming bookends to our play wasn't thought out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latter type is inevitable in any group that lasts for any length of time. We may even try to carry some of these things forward to other groups if we migrate, but it always takes time before those things take. In this case, it's kind of a hybrid. You had something that worked in your last group, and you want to try to achieve the same thing in your new group, but the thing wasn't begun as explicit ritual, and you probably still don't think of it as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I'm largely interested in the explicit type of ritual. On the other hand, the gradual type is interesting because it's more practical, since it emerged from practice, and can be a great resource when thinking about explicit ritual techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting thing: The terminology of ritual is completely unnecessary, except where it gives you something to call it in discussion. When implementing things, explicitly or gradually, you never have to call it ritual. Hell, you don't have to call it anything. You can just that there's this thing you want to try. You don't have to talk about separateness, or liminal spaces. You can say that it will help set the mood (whether it be somber, darkly humorous, or gung-ho) and help people get focused on playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nA technique an old group (the TRoS group) of mine considered, but never actually put into practice: Playing shortish card or board games prior to starting roleplaying which had similar themes to what you wanted to play. For instance, Bang! before Dogs in the Vineyard (or any western-type game). Another technique I tried semi-successfully was to encourage players to pick theme songs or create character sound-tracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm. Re-reading your post, I'd like to ask: why is the concept of Separateness a problem?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263070/#Comment_263070" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-20T04:30:38+00:00" title="March 20, 2010  4:30AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nikodemus</cite>A GM has to be careful what groups he introduces potentially controversial game elements to, to avoid upsetting or alienating players -- unless that is his purpose in the first place.</blockquote>\nFixed that for you. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br>Why would you want to alienate your players?

It... seems to fit the definition I'm working from, but something about it doesn't feel right. Possibly because it excludes the out of character portions of play from the separateness, so while it may BE ritual, it seems less useful in terms of ritual. I'm sure it's very useful in terms of division of OOC and IC play, but that breaks play into several instances of OOC and IC during a single session, rather than a single instance of play. Your later examples fit pretty well into the general scheme of the discussion so far, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have any particular arguments in favor of OOC/IC division being useful in terms of creating liminal space? I'd like to hear them if you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave W,<br/>\n<br/>\nTradition. Of course. Simple terms tend to elude me sometimes. Obviously tradition can be very powerful in creating liminal space, especially as it tends to have the force of comfortable long term buy-in behind it. I don't have a lot of experience with it in terms of gaming, sadly. My longest running gaming experiences were only a couple years in length, and things were too unsteady much of the time, what with changes in the group make-up, play location, and even gaming system. We had a few traditions that managed to make it from game to game, but they were small things, and I'm not sure how helpful they were in creating separateness.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of gaming, tradition plays a big part in my life. For instance, there's that special moment, some short time before Christmas when the tree is finally decorated, the lights are dimmed, and Christmas music is playing in the background. I could have been irritated, uninterested in decorating, annoyed by the scratches on my arms from running the lights around the trunk... But once the lights are dimmed down, everything before has seemed to become... distant, unimportant, for just a moment. Then the lights come up, and we grab egg nog, and that's good too, but it's not the same. The moment is over, and all the concerns from before are present once more, albeit usually with a bit more distance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sort of separation is what I'd like to see ritual achieve in gaming. There's a sense of connection between these moments, like they're all the same, even when the details change, and that they're very much outside of the normal routines, practices and concerns of life. You go away from all of that for this time, this activity, then you come back. Anything that happened during the game session still happened, but it's different, special.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263550/#Comment_263550" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T19:13:22+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  7:13PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't have any arguments to make; just sharing some observations.  Maybe the only takeaway is that the transition to and from ritual space can be more subtle (in terms of character of experience) than transitions from one type of play to another within that ritual space.  <br><br>I read Meg's posts from way back, and those all sounded like awesome practices to do intentionally.  But my groups have never really needed them, as the existence of such separate space has always coexisted with a level of engagement in the fiction.  Once the fiction's dominating your thoughts, you're in.  Once you get bored, you're out, and so (probably) are the other participants.  For me, all sense of "special safe space" vanishes when someone would rather read a book or send text messages than pay attention to my game contributions.  That hasn't happened in years, though.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263598/#Comment_263598" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T01:49:14+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  1:49AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>Why would you want to alienate your players?

At the beginning, we entered the gaming space carrying lit candles - which is based on real-life Easter celebrations, apparently. It was very clear that this marked the beginning of the game. We'd been instructed that the game would end at 22.00 with another real-life ritual: The cracking of the easter eggs. Most of the game took place around a table, and having both the candles (beginning) and eggs (end) in front of us the whole time really helped keep these rituals present in our minds. <br><br>So, two things:<br>- Very clear marking of the limits (in time and space) of the game<br>- Rituals that had significance both inside and outside the fiction                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263994/#Comment_263994" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T04:25:35+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  4:25AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mm. I think that's another aspect of ritual that we've touched upon, but not really discussed. Ritual to set a particular mood can be powerful, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the rituals in this case were actually part of the in-character action? Interesting. I wonder if that's a technique that would work equally well with a non-LARP, or if it's peculiar to live-action play. As an ongoing game, you'd have to structure the fiction a bit to allow for opening/closing rituals to be part of both in-character and out-of-character play, but I think it could be workable. If, for instance, I'd set a structure where the Sabbat pack that formed my V:tM game met for a nightly Vinculum ceremony at the beginning of each night, that could be a way to incorporate both IC and OOC ritual. That would probably have worked for that group, but I don't know that it would have worked for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
