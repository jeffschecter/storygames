Defined character classes with point-cost special abilities, monsters with limited stats and one or two special attack abilities, magic weapons that can be generated based upon key words, the use of miniatures and maps for tactical fights... isn't this what I've been reading on the net and hearing on the official podcast?<br/><br/>And I think the D&amp;D Diablo II game is rather cool how it runs you through a tabletop version of the video game, so I am already pretty partial to it and think it holds up well over time.

I think a lot of the appeal of the game and its settings has been the ability to take or leave elements, including character classes.<br/><br/>I think why Diablo II version interests me is because it is a stripped-down version of D&amp;D 3.0, which is what 4E really sounds like to me. I wrote a review of the D&amp;D boxed set a while back, and it really played more like a board game with RPG elements than a full out roleplaying game. And I said then I thought it made for a better game because it had all the basic fun elements of D&amp;D but was much more accessible, and again, that is what 4E continues to sound like to me.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131239/#Comment_131239" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T11:12:53+00:00" title="February 28, 2008 11:12AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its interesting how folks are finding parallels between D&amp;D 4.0 and games that they liked and thought did something right over the past 15 years or so.

The Tiefling, for example, is being prompted as the race fro players who want to play anti-heroic good-guys-in-black-hats.  That annoys me, because it makes the Tiefling even less realistic.  It also limits creativity.  New players will be lead to believe that if they want to play a dour, no nonsense, stubborn character they have to play a Dwarf, and if they want to play a wise-cracking antiauthoritarian libertine they have to play a Tiefling, etc.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything about 4E doesn't appeal to me.  If I wanted to play MMORPG, I'd play World of Warcraft.  The more and more D&amp;D tries to emulate computer games, the less and less it embraces the very things that make it different than video games, and the more and more it approaches the horizon over which lays Epic Fail.  If D&amp;D becomes a slow, clunky MMORPG that takes ten times as long to set up, costs ten times as much to get started, and doesn't even offer cool shiny graphics, then what's the point of D&amp;D?  Why not just play a real MMORPG?<br/><br/>Oh well, one good thing has come out of 4E.  I finally got off my ass and checked out what else was on the market, and discovered the Indie Revolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131307/#Comment_131307" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:19:48+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:19PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just sitting here grinning in agreement.

The Tiefling, for example, is being prompted as the race fro players who want to play anti-heroic good-guys-in-black-hats.  That annoys me, because it makes the Tiefling even less realistic.  It also limits creativity.  New players will be lead to believe that if they want to play a dour, no nonsense, stubborn character they have to play a Dwarf, and if they want to play a wise-cracking antiauthoritarian libertine they have to play a Tiefling, etc.</blockquote>\nSo, when D&amp;D tries to have focus it sucks, but when indie RPGs are focused, it's awesome?

The developers recognized that nearly ALL video game RPGs are D&amp;D in a different guise. They haven't changed to be more like them.
