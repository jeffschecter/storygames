Describe things that you naturally imagine would be in a dungeon.</li>\n<li>Picture the dungeon.</li>\n<li>Don't be afraid to make things up.</li>\n<li>Let one thing lead to another: let your description of the walls lead to describing the shadows on them.</li>\n<li>Expand on details: let your description of the walls lead to describing the brickwork. Don't worry about going into too much detail: if you spend 30 seconds describing the brickwork, that's fine.</li>\n<li>Don't censor yourself.</li>\n<li>Describe things you find unpleasant.</li></ul>\nKeep going for at least 30 seconds: again, you're describing aloud.<br/><br/>Did you find that difficult or was it easy?

There were some creatures camped underneath them, and you could just see the light from the torches of some adventurers coming round a corner. In parts the ceiling was very high. There were echoes and a musty smell. The bricks of the wall were damp and the grouting crumbled to the touch.<br/><br/>In part, I guess, it might have been inspired by Ultima Underworld and the various games for which I created dungeons over the years, underground cities being a speciality. Also, creative writing has taught me to hit all the senses. Jack Vance may also have something to answer for. But I did wonder about the audience. Who was I describing this for, how much should be obvious to them, and how much secret and how much should hint at some deeper truth or mystery. The room exists for a reason.

Spend 30 seconds editing what you have so far; delete things you don't like, expand on things you like, organize everything a bit.<br/><br/>3.  NOW spend 30 seconds talking about the dungeon room.<br/><br/><br/>Or another approach, based on the 'constraints are liberating' concept:<br/><br/>1.  Spend 30 seconds thinking and making notes about the dungeon as a whole.  Something like "It's a kobold warren, clawed out of the clay soil.  Moist, hot, stinky.  Most tunnels 3' high.  Fungus."<br/><br/>2.

I detailed the source of light in the room for quite a while including the flickering yellow and the complementary shadows.  I totally stumbled when I got to the last bullet.  I felt pressured to add something unpleasant.  I ended up with it being quite cool and then fumbled for bad odors.  It didn't start out as an unpleasant room and then I had to retrofit unpleasantness into it.<br/><br/>I first imageined a big room -- you told me to!  Then it seemed weird to be big, so I put a big sloping pit in the center.  Then, I was going around the room looking for details as I was reading your list, so I talked about the walls (hewn from the living stone, not masonry at all) and the iron pots hanging around the perimeter with burning oil in each which lead to imagining the yellow light cast and the darkness in the center of the room.  But since I'd already established the sloped pit, I made sure the edges of the slope were visible and the darkend center was creepy and alluring.  Then there was sand on the floor and some lichen growing on a broken barrel in the corner, stuff like that.  So I guess I was panning around the room and serially zooming in on details.<br/><br/>I think you could make it easier by asking the subject a bunch of questions instead of providing directions, at least once you're past the "do this aloud and visualize the chamber as you speak" bits.  What is the focus of the room?  Is it currently being used?  By whom?  For what?  What do the walls look like?  Are there signs of life?  How is the room lit?  What do the features that you have thus far elaborated say about the state of this place?  Is this place unpleasant?  How?  What does it smell/feel/sound like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245605/#Comment_245605" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T15:51:20+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  3:51PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really useful stuff.

If your locale is so overwhelmingly surprising each time, then it's perhaps harder for the players to shine in comparison?<br/><br/>Darn, there goes my room with the Abeoleth trying on Victoria Secret underwear!<br/><br/>But seriously, I didn't see anything in Graham's description that implied it should be dull, nor did I mean to imply that the surprise should be overhelming. It just means that the room should feel alive, and thus have something of the unexpected in it. This could be as normal as some interesting brickwork, or a well-described peice of furniture.<br/><br/>One interesting thing Graham did ask for was 'things that make you feel unpleasantt". I'm not sure what he's asking for there. Graham, do you mean disturbing content like severed heads or something, or do you mean something that is disturbing to describe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245613/#Comment_245613" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T17:11:51+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  5:11PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I meant was: don't try to consciously make your dungeon interesting. Just describe whatever would naturally be there. If you think whirring blades would naturally be there? Cool. But don't think: oh, I need to make this interesting, what can I do?<br/><br/>By "things that make you feel unpleasant", I just meant that you shouldn't be afraid of creeping yourself out. In my dungeon, I described an unlit ceiling, way above, from which a clear slime dripped, coating the floors. That idea makes me grimace, but that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
