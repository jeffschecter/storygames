I'm a very "neat" drunk.  I talk about GoPlayNW, my new Netflix account, the Alternate Lifestyles panels I have in mind for next NorWesCon, LGBT issues in fandom, Horrorfest, I answer a listener question from Podcast 3, and I gush about the awesomeness that is Glen Cook.  <br/><br/><a href="http://sirriamnicast.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Geek Girls Rule Podcasts</a><br/><br/>Also, don't forget to visit the column itself at <a href="http://www.geekgirlsrule.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Geek Girls Rule! columns</a>  I talk about stuff there that doesn't make it into the podcasts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
