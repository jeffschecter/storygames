                    So in Grey Ranks there  are six things your character might hold dear.  You and your friends will each choose one for your own character, and they must be unique - they cannot overlap between characters.  Faith, patriotism, love and duty are all tightly bound in the choice.  It is literally the soul of who your character is.  I'm interested in getting these right and making sure each choice is equally compelling.  <br/><br/>The things your character can currently hold dear are:<br/><br/>MY FAITH<br/>Religious life is central to who your character is - parish priest, neighborhood church, Warsaw cathedral, local soup kitchen, not to mention his personal relationship with the Lord are all wrapped up in faith.  It is also possible to have - and to lose - faith in world communism, should your character be inclined that way.  No matter what faith means, losing it represents a personal spiritual crisis of the first order.  <br/><br/>MY COUNTRY<br/>This includes the resistance, the Home Army, and anything related to the larger struggle for a free Poland.  If your character's country is his Soul, he is a zealous patriot.  Losing this might cause a character to abandon their ideals, question authority, or shirk their duty.<br/><br/>MY CITY<br/>Dear Warsaw, Poland's great city and the only place your character has ever known.  Every square and alley is dear to his heart.  This includes family friends, teachers, doctors, and all the people and places that make home, Home.  Once one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, to see it callously torn apart is heart-rending.  <br/><br/>MY FAMILY<br/>This is principally your character's immediate family - mother, father, grandparents, brothers and sisters.  This includes extended family - cousins, aunts and uncles, as well as more distant relatives - perhaps even displaced family he didn't even know he had.<br/><br/>MY FRIENDS<br/>This includes your character's scouting crew and perhaps some dear friends who are not in the Grey Ranks - probably older kids now in the regular resistance, or maybe some younger hell-raising Zawiszacy.  If your character's friends are the most important thing in his life, losing them will no doubt turn him into a bitter loner.  <br/><br/>MY FIRST LOVE<br/>Your character's first love is a special person, probably someone active in the Grey Ranks.  For this person to be his Soul reflects either great passion or unhealthy obsession.  Losing a first love is absolutely devastating, as it should be.  Your character's first love will never truly be replaced, although he may love again.  <br/><br/>In play you may be forced to destroy these things you collectively hold dear when your characters fail under pressure.  The destruction, if it comes, will be complete.  The thing that you hold dear must have a concrete symbol - St. John's cathedral in Old Town or your little sister, for example.  When you lose it, this symbol will be lost, metaphor to the greater calamity.<br/><br/>So my question to you all - is this list sufficiently diverse and refined?  The typical game will see four of the six being selected - which do you see as the least interesting or most difficult to implement?  Am I missing something huge and obvious that a scared, idealistic teen might cling to?                </div>

                            Jason, <br/><br/>I think that they are a good set (especially my city) and requiring a concrete symbol makes them even stronger<br/><br/>the only category I can think of would be my future, as in career plans, desire to travel to place X... but it's more abract than most of your categories and therefore probably worse                        </div>

                            oh- one other possibility popped into mind- my childhood: as in innocence, memories of play. This is probably captured by your combo of friends, family + city                        </div>

                            Thanks, guys.  I think principles and lack thereof could be addressed by the derangement/martyrdom corners of the grid.  So is My First Love, really (nervous breakdown corner).  I think Identity or Culture or Future might be too hard to invoke in play, and could maybe be wrapped up in other things.  Let's say your dude dreamed of being a dentist - that was his thing.  That could get folded into My Family (expectations), My Country (service), etc.  I'll have to think on it some more.  I worry that First Love and Friends are too weak - they seem the least directly grabby to me right now.                        </div>

                            I think you've covered the main concepts there. Whenever I thought of something new (My Allies/Comrades was one) I realised it was already covered in the existing ones, which I think is a pretty good sign.                        </div>
