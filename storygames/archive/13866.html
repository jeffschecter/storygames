The more you play, the more complex the history becomes. Your once simple summary becomes a detailed tapestry, full of meaning and surprises. It\u2019s fractal gaming.<br/><br/>Want to leap a thousand years in the future and see how an institution shaped society? Want to jump back to the childhood of the king you just saw assassinated and find out what made him such a hated ruler? That\u2019s normal in Microscope. You have the freedom to move around and examine whatever you want, defying limits of time and space.<br/><br/>You have vast power to create... and to destroy. Build beautiful, tranquil jewels of civilization and then consume them with nuclear fire. Zoom out to watch the majestic tide of history wash across empires, then zoom in and explore the lives of the people who endured it.</blockquote>\nI haven't talked much about Microscope around here recently because I've been heads down getting it done, but there are about a zillion people here who deserve thanks for playing it and helping me finally finish it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313981/#Comment_313981" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T15:25:23+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  3:25PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hurray!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313985/#Comment_313985" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T15:34:51+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  3:34PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations, Ben!

Periods contain events, and events contain scenes.  <br/><br/>Each period, event, or scene is represented by an index card, so you need a bit of table space to play the game.  Players take turns dealing periods, events, or scenes onto the table.  Each card must be judged as morally good or morally bad, which is very interesting, because it guides the fiction in surrounding cards and helps characterize the fictional people who are recording the history.\n<blockquote>Also, does the game encourage you to get inside the skins of individual characters and explore their lives, or is it more of a distant overview?</blockquote>\nYes.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314011/#Comment_314011" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T17:02:29+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  5:02PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks johnzo!<br/><br/>I will definitely check this out, and make pick up the pdf in the near future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314017/#Comment_314017" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T17:30:28+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  5:30PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I've been a spectator for part of a couple different games of Microscope, but I've never had the opportunity to play even though I've been really curious about the game.

On each player's turn they decide what part of the history they want to explore (aka expand) and then pick a scale to build: do they create a massive new Period, create a new Event describing something that happens in a Period someone else already made, or drill down into the nitty gritty of a particular Event and make a Scene showing us what really happened, right there, right then, with those people.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Each card must be judged as morally good or morally bad, which is very interesting, because it guides the fiction in surrounding cards and helps characterize the fictional people who are recording the history.</blockquote>\nI should point out that Microscope doesn't presume any fictional historians -- the only people looking down on the history are the players. It seems like a minor point but it's actually kind of critical. What you add to the history is real, not the subjective viewpoint of some fictional observer.<br/><br/>Of course within the history there are plenty of cases where people misremember, distort, or flat-out make up facts. We see a teacher tell her students how colonists peacefully settled this planet a century ago, but then we can zoom back and see what really happened. Is what she said true? No? Then maybe we'll zip back to the future and see if she was lying or just clueless. Wait, she lied? Why would the teacher lie to her students? Let's zip to another part of the history and find out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314023/#Comment_314023" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T17:43:25+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  5:43PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Congratulations on this milestone.</blockquote>\nI totally read that as "millstone" for a second.

I pay four or five bucks for UPS pretty much anywhere else, but there it's upwards of ten dollars most times. I paid $11 for two books last time I bought from IPR.

It wasn't needed anymore. Now that Scenes use Push / finger-voting, the players can directly decide whether they think something makes sense. If they think it goes against the Tone, they can vote it down. If they think it makes sense even if it completely defies Tone, they can vote it up.<br/><br/>This fixes the troublesome cases where Debt might say "there must be Dark!" and maybe the players agreed there should be more Dark but right now someone has a good Light idea that would fit perfectly, but they couldn't do it because the Debt blocked them. Not cool. Fiction is complicated, so there are always cases where seeming contradictions make wonderful sense to the players.<br/><br/>I don't kid around when it comes to killing sacred cows. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314305/#Comment_314305" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-25T17:13:40+00:00" title="February 25, 2011  5:13PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And then we keep light and dark around because judging fictional history in moral terms is interesting?

What we really have to work on is the scenes, that is, asking the right question for the right scene.

That wasn't my goal designing it, but it became clear pretty early on that players were really tempted to play out linear campaigns within a Microscope history they made -- everybody knows and feels very attached to the setting.

Because we love Gamma Ray and we play Microscope there all the time...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315387/#Comment_315387" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T18:35:01+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  6:35PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds kind of like Shock.

You might look at how global economies erode national power one minute, then jump back and see how tribes build the first city.<br/><br/>Concept-wise, exploring the rise and fall of a civilization is always great fit, but Microscope can actually create a much wider range of games. We've played histories of God returning to Earth (literally, Biblical God), superheroes undermining the rule of law (Watchmen-style), Ragnarok / doom of the gods, the growth of a single corporation from its humble roots, and cold war political intrigue.<br/><br/>One history I've really wanted to try is a "Curse of the Pharaohs" game, reaching from ancient times where we watch the intrigues unfold between temple priests and living gods, all the way to modern archaeologists exhuming tombs and awakening 'that which was better left unknown.' I think jumping back and forth from modern discoveries to the ancient events that explains those discoveries would be pretty cool.<br/><br/>I think we're still just scratching the surface of what's possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316542/#Comment_316542" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T08:59:23+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  8:59AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played Thursday.

But as I said in the book, it's not always bad. For those who haven't read it yet, I'll save time and quote:\n<blockquote><cite>Microscope</cite>Immortality has similar problems. It can work if lots of characters are immortal (like pantheons of gods), but if immortality is a special trait of just one or a few characters, they may hog the spotlight (\u201cnot Doctor Lazarus again!\u201d). Another good rule of thumb is never to have character lives span more than one Period since that starts to weld adjacent Periods together. Once you\u2019re thinking about lifespan, you start to estimate precisely how many years must have passed, which locks things down.</blockquote>\nI do find that Microscope games where part of the concept is immortality (gods, your Highlander game idea Tim) work great. The problem is usually when someone likes a character, and so they keep bringing them back, but you're kind of sick of them. The aforesaid Doctor Lazarus.<br/><br/>So how do you handle it? The rules give you some solid protections from spotlight hogging figures, whether they're immortal or not. If you're making the Scene, you can outright ban a character you don't want ("and I ban the Sentient Sun..." True story. Somewhere Tony and Paul are weeping). The flip side is that if someone else is making the Scene, they _can_ include any character they want, but of course they'll be the last one to pick who they play, so you can also guarantee someone else plays that character if you're tired of hearing them do the funny voice for the King of the Frogs, or whatever. It is impossible for a player to maintain a monopoly on a character.<br/><br/>If you think certain characters are starting to span too much history, you have another simple solution: kill them. Or show them being born/created. Either one bookends them in history, so you know they didn't exist before X, and they don't exist after Y. As always they're not out of the game (nothing is ever out the game in Microscope) so anyone who wants to explore them more can do so in the history they're already a part of, but they can't expand farther.<br/><br/>And don't forget the Palette. If you don't want immortals, just say No at the outset. If someone does want long-lived characters that span multiple Periods, the Palette is the right time to ask if it's okay to have that in the Yes column.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Risus%20Monkey" title="Risus Monkey"><img alt="Risus Monkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Risus%20Monkey">Risus Monkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316668/#Comment_316668" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T05:24:06+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  5:24AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>superheroes undermining the rule of law (Watchmen-style)</blockquote>\nThat brings up another question that I've been pondering... how does Microscope work in historical eras?

You just have less latitude to create broadly (of course) and some of the social steam valves built into the game will have less power to help you.<br/><br/>Limited physical space is a bigger problem than limited time. If you play a game that takes place in a small area (like or a single town or a colony ship, which we've done) then big changes are inescapable, and likewise known facts in the future can prevent you from being able to make changes (if colony ship is around at the end, you can't crash it into the sun in the middle). But if you have a huge physical space to work with (like all the many theatres of WWII) then even with a small timeline you have latitude to jump around.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Risus Monkey</cite>I get a sense that you still don't want to be specific about dates, but there will undoubtedly be associations with trends or events that place things (more or less) specifically in time.</blockquote>\nWhen we did games in real world alternate history, people tended to draw parallels to known history to make it easier to visualize: "this Period has gangsters with tommy guns, gambling dens -- it's like the Prohibition-era" or "so this would be later, kind of like the 70s." Of course you could wind up with a bunch of Periods "in the 70s" or none in some decades. The distribution doesn't have to be even at all, but of course if you're paralleling real history you're going to know in the back of your mind that you have skipped over some spans of time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>After our crazy long AW game (30 sessions?), some of the players got together and told the story of the next era of our apocalypse world, using Microscope.

Lots of folks have talked about using Microscope to build a game world to play in, but this is the first time I've heard of using it as an epic epilogue for a game everyone has already been playing together.

Quite the opposite. In the book I actually recommend against even including time travel in your history, because if the characters are able to move through time, the players being able to do it is a lot less meaningful. It cancels out.<br/><br/>But doing a biography with Microscope could be rather cool.

The other idea I had was a kind of Everett-Wheller-Graham model branching realities story, where you see the consequences of a character's big decisions. Like the movie "Mr. Nobody", only good.<br/><br/>Ben, I played a game of Microscope last night and it went well, but the played scenes all felt a bit flat. Do you have any recommendations for choosing / phrasing of questions or playing of scenes that might help? Specifically, we were alternately trying hard not to pre-answer the question, and groping for an answer in the next scene. It felt a little bit forced, and I'm pretty sure that either we were missing something about the system, or missing something about setting up the scene. Advice would be greatly appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317350/#Comment_317350" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-21T07:20:46+00:00" title="March 21, 2011  7:20AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What questions did you ask?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317360/#Comment_317360" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-21T08:30:40+00:00" title="March 21, 2011  8:30AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Why were the frozen crew members jettisoned?" and "What happened to the survey team?"

There's a difference here from an ordinary game - when it's important that the description gets a transition from a few sentences spoken out loud to just one summary sentence written down, then it's more important that the player who created it also does that transition. Since it's already written down in pbp, it's not the same big deal.<br/><br/>Scenes is another deal, and we have only done one so I can't really answer very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318920/#Comment_318920" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-05T14:59:40+00:00" title="April  5, 2011  2:59PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once I figured out the Zebra tool, and the menu that hides in the upper left corner, Prezi became very easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was one moment when two of us were in the Prezi, editing like it was a shared google doc.

But it hides a surprising amount of depth. We played a game based on a couple of reads on my part, with me teaching the very basics of it to the players. We ended up falling into a couple of simplified approaches which weren\u2019t as fruitful (sticking with generics, a slight misreading of the legacies idea). Going back to the book, I found advice which at first glance had seemed a little excessive. In fact, the advice and suggestions presented really do make sense after you\u2019ve played once. The game\u2019s obviously been extensively play-tested and it shows in the explanations of best and most fruitful practices.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13866/microscope-ive-heard-of-you-i-heard-you-were-dead" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13866/microscope-ive-heard-of-you-i-heard-you-were-dead" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13866/microscope-ive-heard-of-you-i-heard-you-were-dead/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13866%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13866%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
