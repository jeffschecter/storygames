<p>So, trying out this whole 19 questions.  Trying to get a grip on a game that's been floating around my head and computer for years, but never quite came together, and find a way to get it really focused.</p>
<p>If you're willing, tell me how it sounds.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>1.) What is your game about?</em></p>
<p>Surviving the horrors after an apocalypse, not least of which is your own broken mind. Survival through community, especially.</p>
<p><em>2.) What do the characters do?</em></p>
<p>They barter, wander, fight, lead, follow, negotiate, starve, eat, drink, burn, rest, bleed, go mad, stave off madness through companionship, and sometimes, occasionally suddenly, they die.</p>
<p><em>3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?</em></p>
<p>Get caught up in small-group conflicts that are fueled by scarcity, hardship, and a need for companionship that is sometime slighted - and sometimes explosively so.</p>
<p><em>4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</em></p>
<p>The Apocalypse itself is the result of a solar accident - something is wrong with the sun. Something magnetic and complicated, that caused seizures, killed people, wiped out electronics, and drove everyone Feral for months. The only way to remain stable is to avoid being alone too long. Of course, there isn't enough of anything, and you can't trust anyone.</p>
<p><em>5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?</em></p>
<p>Characters will need to select a short list of archetypes they conform to, which bolster their identity. Alone, they won't have enough. Together, they often won't get along.</p>
<p><em>6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?</em></p>
<p>Having a variety of approaches available, through teamwork, will be rewarded. Internal conflict at a low level in the group will be rewarded. "Lone Wolf" behaviour will be punished.</p>
<p><em>7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?</em></p>
<p>I'm working on it.</p>
<p><em>8.) How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?</em></p>
<p>Traditional arrangement, with a strong empowered-players vibe.</p>
<p><em>9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation?</em></p>
<p>Players will constantly need to choose what kind of damgers they wish to face; they'll usually have a lot of choice, but every path is dangerous.</p>
<p><em>10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?</em></p>
<p>A poker-hand-like mechanism IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m building out of another system of mine (The  Exchange), with a few twists - when a character 'pushes' with a trait, they also increase the backlash they face.</p>
<p><em>11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?</em></p>
<p>There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. Characters will often be packing around little injuries of various kinds - physical, social, psychological, you name it.</p>
<p><em>12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?</em></p>
<p>Yes. That's gonna see some changes. Advancement and Backlash are going to get tied in - a little like Fallout in Dogs, but only a little.</p>
<p><em>13.) How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</em></p>
<p>You get nothing until you put your ass on the line. Period.</p>
<p><em>14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?</em></p>
<p>I want the players to feel that the world is terrible. <br/>
I want them to know that they can't live without each other.<br/>
I want them to feel their characters wavering between becoming too hard to stay sane, and too sympathetic to stay alive, and needing to make choices right there.</p>
<p><em>15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?</em></p>
<p>Scarcity. Interpersonal mechanics. Psychological wounds. The whole "western" vibe. Because all of those play together in my head to make a space for something where players can be assured that their characters are cool and badass - and then let that stand as backdrop for them to hit things that aren't hard or badass at all.</p>
<p><em>16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in?</em></p>
<p>The altered mechanic for The Exchange, which will hopefully look and feel like playing a hand of poker for high stakes. The idea of stripping everything down to bare fundamentals, in so many different ways, both in the rules, the setting, all of it.</p>
<p><em>17.) Where does your game take the players that other games canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, or wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t?</em></p>
<p>Guilt. Every character in the game has done wrong. Horrible wrong. They need to live with it. They need to forgive themselves. They need to forgive each other. They can never forget.</p>
<p>It gives reasons to struggle against both sympathy and becoming hardened.</p>
<p><em>18.) What are your publishing goals for your game?</em></p>
<p>Write it. Play it. Hear someone, somewhere, scream "OMFGBBQ!!!" because it's just that damn good.</p>
<p><em>19.) Who is your target audience?</em></p>
<p>Me.  Anyone that wants a game that sits right on that line.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Hmm.   Sound too focused?  Not focused enough?  I'm going to be using this as my 'goal list' to work on while writing.  I'm not sure what I think.</p>

                            Looks like you have put together a really cool Situation, enabling you (or whoever GMs) to stoke up the heat and see which way people pop. It's got my head working.<br/>Quick thoughts (I really ought to read the Exchange to get a fuller measure of this. Also, job):<br/><br/>I feel that your answer to 3) is really just more of an answer to 2). I'm assuming you don't want your <i>players</i> to be slighted (especially in an explosive manner), as you want everyone to be enjoying the game. The <i>characters</i> clash. So are players actively trying to make this happen, and getting their jollies from that, or are they all working hard to try and make sure their characters get along, in the knowledge that they can only be doing it for so long? Where do the players stand in relation to the characters and their small-group conflicts... 14) hints towards this but I still don't know whether players learn how the characters need each other by trying to keep them together in precarious situations, or learn this by dashing them together periodically and watching the consequences in transfixed horror.<br/><br/>17) sounds really cool, the dark past shadowing the present. So cool, in fact, that I think it should be mentioned further up, ie in 1).                        </div>

                            Don't worry too much about reading the Exchange.  The changes to it are pretty huge - basically, it remains a name-your-traits system with small ratings that has narration-based effects.  It's not a new idea.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, players should be enjoying their characters on this.  I'm not sure if I want to try and give players the attitude of smashing them around or needing to carefully manage; in some ways, I'll let the system tell *me* which of those are viable possibilities, and go from there.<br/>
<br/>
And, yeah.  (17) should go up to (1).                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
RE: #3<br/>
<br/>
Your answer tells me that there are various and separate small groups of players competing with each other in real life over some kind of resources and conflicting over territorial rights within the room where play is taking place.  Is this what you mean?  If it's not, try thinking about question number #3 as asking how the players play the game.  Right now your answer to that question sounds more like what the characters do in game.<br/>
<br/>
RE:#5<br/>
<br/>
The part where you say, "Characters will need to select a short list of archetypes they conform to, which bolster their identity" doesn't seem to have much of anything to do with this: "Alone, they won't have enough. Together, they often won't get along."  Focus on what a character has and what he lacks.  He can choose an "identity" for color later.  The have/have not aspect of the characters is what is really compelling about them in your game.<br/>
<br/>
RE:#8<br/>
<br/>
The "traditional arangement" and "strong empowered players" are mutually exclusive of each other.  Describe how narration and credibility are really divided in your game in detail.<br/>
<br/>
RE:#9<br/>
<br/>
How does every player's individual choice engage all the other players at the same time?  Give details.<br/>
<br/>
RE:#13<br/>
<br/>
So the character's survival being at stake is the only thing that can ever change him in a meaningful way?  Do the other charcters and players have any impact on his progression?<br/>
<br/>
RE:#15<br/>
<br/>
What are the interpersonal mechanics like?<br/>
<br/>
RE:#17<br/>
<br/>
This is what your game is really about.  Your answer to #1 describes the setting and situation.<br/>
<br/>
RE:#18<br/>
<br/>
Your answer does not talk about publishing in any format what-so-ever.<br/>
<br/>
RE:#19<br/>
<br/>
First, I greatly encourage you to look beyond yourself as an audience.  Second, "people who might like it" is not a good answer when talking about a target audience.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            All right.  Taking it from the top.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
*1.) What is your game about?*<br/>
<br/>
The Pulse is set after an apocalyptic event that has profoundly terrible effects on the human mind.  This is a game about survivors.  In the sense of surviving in hardship.  In the sense of surviving prison.  In the sense of 'a rape survivor'.   This is a game about people that are hurt, hungry, damaged, hardened, and hanging on to life and love with a white-knuckled grip.<br/>
<br/>
*2.) What do the characters do?*<br/>
<br/>
They barter, wander, fight, lead, follow, negotiate, starve, eat, drink, burn, rest, bleed, go mad, stave off madness through companionship, and sometimes, occasionally suddenly, they die.  They get caught up in small-group conflicts that are fueled by scarcity, hardship, and a need for companionship that is sometime slighted - and sometimes explosively so.<br/>
<br/>
*3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?*<br/>
<br/>
They players, including the GM, work together to drive the characters into and through their hardships, actively bringing out the issues that plague these characters in situation-based play.  The GM has and uses the rules to generate situations driven by scarcity that will hit on these issues, hard.<br/>
<br/>
*4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?*<br/>
<br/>
The Apocalypse itself is the result of a solar accident - something is wrong with the sun. Something magnetic and complicated, that caused seizures, killed people, wiped out electronics, and drove everyone Feral for months. The only way to remain stable is to avoid being alone too long. Of course, there isn't enough of anything, and you can't trust anyone.<br/>
<br/>
*5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?*<br/>
<br/>
The focus of the mechanics will be in highlighting what things the character can give a group of survivors in the setting, what they need from others in it, and the isssues that drive them to and anway from other survivors.  <br/>
<br/>
*6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?*<br/>
<br/>
Having a variety of approaches available, through teamwork, will be rewarded. Internal conflict at a low level in the group will be rewarded. "Lone Wolf" behaviour will be punished. <br/>
<br/>
*7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?*<br/>
<br/>
Some game resources, and some forms of 'healing', will only be possible to gain through social contact, some with teamwork, others which are bickering-and-tension-related.<br/>
<br/>
*8.) How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?*<br/>
<br/>
The game will use a GM that has general ownership over the current situation itself; players will have fairly standard levels of character ownership.   The game setting outside these things will be open for input to everyone, and details of the situation that are mainly flavour will also be open for input from everyone.  Credibilty is based on a consensus led by the GM, informally.<br/>
<br/>
*9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation?*<br/>
<br/>
All situations will have elements of danger to the characters - psychological as well as physical.  Almost all situations will also have potential rewards available.  The group of players as a whole will constantly need to choose what kind of dangers they wish to face; they'll usually have a lot of choice, but every path is dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
*10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?*<br/>
<br/>
A poker-hand-like mechanism IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m building out of another system of mine (The  Exchange), with a few twists - when a character 'pushes' with a trait, they also increase the backlash they face.<br/>
<br/>
*11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?*<br/>
<br/>
There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. Characters will often be packing around little injuries of various kinds - physical, social, psychological, you name it.<br/>
<br/>
*12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?*<br/>
<br/>
Yes. That's gonna see some changes. Advancement and Backlash are going to get tied in - a little like Fallout in Dogs, but only a little.<br/>
<br/>
*13.) How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?*<br/>
<br/>
Advancement is tied strictly to conflict and risk.  Advancement isn't actually going to be possible without risking injury of some kind (be it physical, mental, or any other form).<br/>
<br/>
*14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?*<br/>
<br/>
I want the players to feel that the world is terrible. <br/>
I want them to know that they can't live without each other.<br/>
I want them to feel their characters wavering between becoming too hard to stay sane, and too sympathetic to stay alive, and needing to make choices right there.<br/>
<br/>
*15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?*<br/>
<br/>
The conflict system for the game will allow for any form of conflict, and will require 'ante' and 'bets' for injuries in any conflict.   Injury types described will encompass several kinds of physical,  mental, and interpersonal trauma. <br/>
<br/>
Scarcity.  All situations will be created from a base of scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
The whole "western" vibe. Because all of those play together in my head to make a space for something where players can be assured that their characters are cool and badass - and then let that stand as backdrop for them to hit things that aren't hard or badass at all.<br/>
<br/>
*16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in?*<br/>
<br/>
The altered mechanic for The Exchange, which will hopefully look and feel like playing a hand of poker for high stakes. The idea of stripping everything down to bare fundamentals, in so many different ways, both in the rules, the setting, all of it.<br/>
<br/>
*17.) Where does your game take the players that other games canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, or wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t?*<br/>
<br/>
Guilt. Every character in the game has done wrong. Horrible wrong. They need to live with it. They need to forgive themselves. They need to forgive each other. They can never forget.  It gives reasons to struggle against both sympathy and becoming hardened.<br/>
<br/>
*18.) What are your publishing goals for your game?*<br/>
<br/>
I intend to write The Pulse to format as a digest-sized book.  I may self-publish, or may accept an offer from a small-press company that's interested in "imprinting".<br/>
<br/>
*19.) Who is your target audience?*<br/>
<br/>
Players that want to play in a game that clearly defines a situational style of play based on hardship, and want support for a level of intense decision-making not normally available in mainstream games.<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>"Much better this time around, Levi. So what are you going to do next? What else do you need input on?"</em></p>
<p>I'm looking at my sketch for character sheet, and deciding what changes, now.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think that I need to recast my traits as Abilities (stuff you can do), Needs (stuff you need), Relations (People you trust), and a nice stretch of blank space for Injuries (of all kinds) and Resources (stuff you'll use up).</p>
<p>...Hmm.</p>

                            Heya Levi,<br/>
<br/>
Should your character sheet have a space for "Stuff you have" or "Stuff you can produce"?  The impression I got fromy our game was that each character has something the others need and needs something the others have.  It might be hard to work out at first, but I think it would really pay off.  Like it would be cool if a character could have something like, "secret plot of fertile land", "petrolium reserve," or "fresh spring of water" as character traits.<br/>

                            Hmm.  That's sort of where I was tending towards, though not quite in that way.  Let me see, here, if I can hash it out a little more.<br/>
<br/>
*Traits* give the character the abiity to fulfill needs or win conflicts on an ongoing basis, whether directly or indirectly.  Traits are player-generated, and descriptive.  Some example traits:<br/>
-"Good listener" - the character is a good person to talk to.<br/>
-"Handy with tools" - the character can build things that help out in fulfilling many needs.<br/>
-"Knows the area" - the character knows where to find resources.<br/>
<br/>
*Needs* are things that the character must have fulfilled on a daily basis, or they will suffer degrading injuries.  Every character will have the same basic needs - Hunger, Thirst, Exposure, Loneliness.  They will also have a few more specific needs, created and defined by the player.<br/>
<br/>
*Resources* are things that the character currently possesses that can be expended or lost.  Most resources exist specifically to fulfill needs - Food, Water, Confidence, and so on.  Others are used either as tools or when using tools - petroleum, bullets, and so on.  Each point or 'chip' of a resource is enough to fulfill a need for one day or to be used for one scene.<br/>
<br/>
*Tools* are things a character possesses that aren't normally used up, but which can be taken away, left behind, damaged, or broken.  Some require resources to use, other's don't.  They include things like territory, guns, reputation, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
*Injuries* are forms of damage that can be used against you, can be used to force actions from your character, or can be used to drive your character out of play.  Failure to fulfill your needs will result in injury, and conflicts of all sorts can also result in injury.  Injuries can thus include things like wounds, frustration, physical weakening, and so on.                        </div>

                            This from your desciption above:
<blockquote>The Apocalypse itself is the result of a solar accident - something is wrong with the sun. Something magnetic and complicated, that caused seizures, killed people, wiped out electronics, and drove everyone Feral for months. The only way to remain stable is to avoid being alone too long. Of course, there isn't enough of anything, and you can't trust anyone.</blockquote>
By the way - I'm not giving anything away with my description here that you can't get on the dust jacket of the book: There's an event (called 'The Pulse') which is some sort of signal that comes over the cellular network.  It drives everyone who hears it insane.  Chaos ensues and civilization collapses.  The protagonists in the book assume it was some form of terrorism.<br/><br/>There's more to it after that - but that's the part that caught my eye.<br/><br/>Just a heads-up - people who've read the book will make the same connection.                        </div>
