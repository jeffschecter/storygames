CD seems to be custom-tailored for recreating said movie). What else have you used the game for and what cosmetic changes did you make to facilitate your CD variant?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94496/#Comment_94496" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T17:47:08+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  5:47PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm all ears, but let me throw in my own experiences real quick. I've used Classroom Deathmatch for it's intended purpose, as well as for a musical version of the same. Worked great. Used it for Lost. Also worked great. Plan to use it for both Drifting Classroom and Mad Max in the near future. I also want to use it for a game inspired by Yoshitoshi Abe's Wastelnad manga from Robot. <br/><br/>Other ideas off the top of my head? Take out the violence and use it as a reality TV simulator. Works great for Amazing Race, Survivor or Elimidate. Replace the killing with sports and make a basketball game like Slam Dunk or a racing game like initial D. Replace the kids with superheros for Secret Wars, Contest of Champions or Civil War. Stretch out the time limit and tone down the violence for Days of Our Lives style soap opera. Keep the killing but trade the kids for Rohirrim to replay the battle of Helms Deep. Keep the killing and the kids but trade the Superintendent for Jason, Freddy or whoever for some 80's horror goodness. Swap the Superintendent for an Alien and set it on the Nostradamus for extra points. Hell. Lose the kids and replace them with Aliens and Predators.<br/><br/>Classroom Deathmatch works for anything situation where social conflict is the key and characters can be easily driven off/killed/fired.<br/><br/>But those are just my ideas. Anyone else?<br/><br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94503/#Comment_94503" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T18:31:25+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  6:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I obviously haven't tried it yet (having just bought the game a few hours ago), though I thought that it might work very well for something like Argento's various giallos with a few twists.

It wasn't till I played it for the first time outside my play test group (the grown up play test group anyway)that I realized that of course it can be played for comedy. Duh.

That book isn't particularly funny.  And the parts that ARE funny are generally the "Oh dear gods that's horrible" kind of funny, if you know what I mean.  The kind of funny where you don't laugh so much as cringe and maybe chuckle weakly.  I mean, it's about kids being forced to kill each other, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>That said, I do think the game could (and probably frequently is) played with a slightly lighter tone, if primarily because more people would be more comfortable with it that way.  From my (not completely thorough) reading of the book, I think the things that lend themselves most readily to being humorous are some of the special techniques.  And just having special techniques at all.  It makes it more cinematic rather than completely gritty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
