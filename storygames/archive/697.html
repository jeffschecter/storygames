                    In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=667&amp;page=1#Item_44" rel="nofollow">another thread</a>, CPXB said:<br/><br/><code>My intuition is that to open up gaming to non-gamers one would have to address the classism, racism and sexism that comes with gaming culture. That what limits people from getting into RPGs isn't that gamers are nerds, or that the games deal with elite people, but that gaming culture has some cultural artifacts that disincline people in the working class, women and minorities from more participation. *opens up the worm can*</code><br/><br/>Then Brand pointed out:<br/><br/><code>I agree with much of what you say about the artifacts of gaming keeping non-gamers out.<br/><br/>However, the note I'd add to it is that I know a lot of blue collar folks who game. They just don't game with us, or hang out on the net with us.<br/><br/>So, really, there are two problems there -- why more folks don't game, and why many of the folks who do game are so completly split off from other folks who game that they often don't even know of each other's existance.<br/><br/>However, all of this, every drop, belongs in a new thread.</code><br/><br/>This is that new thread.  I'm going to eat lunch; by the time I get back, I expect to find many interesting things and much ranting.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                </div>

                            I think my best anecdote about busting the assumptions about who is gaming comes from my wife, who is a librarian in ruff-tuff downtown Durham, NC.  Two of her regulars are a homeless couple who until recently slept under a Norfolk-Southern bridge.  They are both a touch mentally ill but really nice, and I'd met them here and there.  One day she heard them talking about their characters.  <br/><br/>"You guys are gamers?" she asked.<br/><br/>"Yeah, we play Mage at the shelter.  There's a guy there who has dice."  And they showed her their character sheets.  One of them had a baby and they sort of vanished before I could quiz them about their gaming experiences.                        </div>

                            Okay, I'd start with some of the things Matt said <a href="http://rpgtalk.net/msw/weblog/148.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>Then I'd add to that the fact that many of the things he talks about are not limited to women, or to racism, but have class ties as well. <br/><br/>Then, I'd pile onto that the fact that most of us (in North America at least, I won't speak for places I've not spent time) have a tendency to cluster by class. We mostly live in areas that are inhabited by people of close to our class level, and mostly socalize with people close to our class level. Even online this clustering happens (and yes, sometimes it happens by people of certain classes not being present online in the same vollume or way as others). So most of our close contact experience (the kind where you get close enough to talk about gaming openly with someone) is limited to people of our generalized class level. <br/><br/>It's only when those barriers get broken that we get a chance to realize what's going on. I've known several game writers who've worked in adult literacy programs (from me in LA to Malcom in Ontario, all the way across the continent, and Jason wherever the hell he lives) who have been shocked to find that many of our students play RPGs. Many of them play without books, or with only one book that they've mostly memorized, by having established procedures of play that members of the group are taught by gaming, rather than by being given the manual to read. <br/><br/>Many of them are surprised to find out the vollume of RPG writing that is being done, especially in anything outside the big names of RPGs. Heck, most of them that I worked with were playing some version of old boxed D&amp;D or AD&amp;D first edition, and were often not aware (and profoundly did not care if they were aware) that there were newer editions. The attitude stands in pretty stark contrast to the consumerist culture that folks like Ron are talking about, where the fetishization of buying new books and reading new material becomes the focus of play. <br/><br/>Under a paradigm like that, imagine one of these guys coming onto RPG.net and looking over the discussion -- with the endless "what is new and cool" and "let us compare detailed knowledge of the Exalted setting books" or, for that matter, similar discussions here in which we're all eager to see the hot new indy release. The very fact that we have such a focus on consuming and aquiring new games, where many of them have not aquired a new game book in over 25 years, drives an instant wedge into communications. <br/><br/>For the record, this isn't saying that RPG.net, or here, is bad for talking the way we talk. I'm not lionizing or condeming either group -- just pointing out one of the divisions of POV that can act as a barrier between groups that are already playing RPGs.                        </div>

                            Let's say you're part of a marginalized group- women, person of color, whatever.  Marginalized- as in less power, less input.   You are used to your words being given less weight, less respect, and less authority than the non-marginalized folks. <br/><br/>So what kind of incentive do you really to have to join a group that involves a) a highly unequal power distribution to begin with, b) a pecking order based on seniority and/or favoritism, and c) individuals who are blind to how their actions enforce the privilege/marginalization?<br/><br/>No one wants to have to wrestle with power issues in order to have fun.  <br/><br/>Folks may want to check out this article:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=10157" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=10157</a><br/><br/>Though it's talking about race, the same behavior patterns emerge with regards to sexism as well.                        </div>

                            One thought I have on the class issue... One of the things I've often struggled with for trying to game on weekends is gamers who are low on the totem pole in retail and security and thus couldn't guarantee they didn't work on Saturday. And one guy can't do evenings and thus hasn't played with us for over a year because he works in the Post Office (sorting room I think) and has early hours. In fact, I'd say it's rare that I have a player in the same job tier as myself.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I'd say mostly a college education was common, but I'm not sure that's true with my current group. I'm not sure what education the learning disabled couple in my group has, and they're certainly close to unemployed. Of course their families are not lower class (and that's something that may be common amongst most of my players).<br/>
<br/>
One thing I think that points out though is that class issues aren't just what you're current situation is, but what environment did you grow up in.<br/>
<br/>
Jason - that's a cool story.<br/>

                            My old roleplaying circle had a spectrum from upper-middle-class to lumpenproletariat, and a variety of ethnic backgrounds, but only one woman. One group I'm playing in currently is about 50% women, but solidly white and middle-class. You take what you get, I suppose.<br/><br/>I think that the question of women in roleplaying might benefit from a look at how roleplaying fits in with women's normal cultural activities. It may be not that the culture's exclusionary, but that roleplaying as a whole is an activity that appeals overwhelmingly to white, middle-class, geeky males. 'Boy's games,' is the semi-contemptuous assessment I've heard from many women.<br/><br/>As with all generalisations, that needs to be qualified by local conditions. My current group, for instance, responded to advertising by a woman, for the express purpose of trying interesting new games. It's well-known that <i>Vampire</i> has a large proportion of female players. Etc.<br/><br/>One last thought: I read a lot of women's concerns in the online roleplaying community, but rather less about class struggle. I wonder if that makes me one of the marginalised here?                        </div>

                            I think a lot of people are still really uncomfortable talking about class, even more so than talking about racism or sexism.<br/><br/>Every single person in my group has a college education, even though our jobs range from well-paid to wage-slave.  That's something that bears some thinking about.  I have no idea how to find people who have a very different background, or if they'd play anything like us if they did.  I know that when it comes to bedtime stories, the kinds of stories that get told are heavily mediated by class.  I wonder if the same holds true for role-playing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when I've been broke, role-playing becomes the Best Hobby Evar.  (Not that it wasn't before!!)  I've only gotten into buying tons of books since I got into this as a research topic; I can easily play once or twice a week for a full year off one game-book, more often if I really like the system, setting or genre.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess and Jeff, <br/><br/>One of the issues about class is that, impossible as it was for me to understand this for years, many "average American middle class folk" (if there really is such a thing) are moderatly aware that racism and sexism are issues, or at least have been issues in the recent past (see Chris's link). Many of them, however, have a giant blind spot about class. They kinda-sorta know it exists, as they've seen crackers on TV and probably dealt with some homeless folks now and then, but an unbelievably large part of them do not think that class plays any roll in their life on a daily basis. <br/><br/>So it doesn't get talked about not just because it isn't comfortable (though it isn't), but because many people are also mostly blind to it.                        </div>

                            It doesn't help that 'class' is tied up with education, taste, money and power, so it's not easy to handle.  For example, my father's family was impoverished but well-educated (well, before he made good and started supporting them), while my mother's family is wealthy but doesn't value education or have 'classy' tastes.  What's the class relationship between the two?  Very unclear!<br/><br/>Part of the reason I'm so passionate about role-playing research is, well, because I like to role-play - just like the passionate reader who studies literature.  But another major part of it is that I think that role-playing is more open, class- and race- and gender-wise, to a variety of people participating as 'creators' and 'makers' of fiction than traditional media forms are.  It's not always that way in <i>practice</i>, because of the power structures within some role-playing communities, and gendered attitudes toward play, and the market for role-playing books, and all that - but I believe that role-playing has the possibility to be a profoundly radical narrative act.<br/><br/>That may or may not be relevant, but it is, nonetheless, how I feel.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<code>It doesn't help that 'class' is tied up with education, taste, money and power, so it's not easy to handle. For example, my father's family was impoverished but well-educated (well, before he made good and started supporting them), while my mother's family is wealthy but doesn't value education or have 'classy' tastes. What's the class relationship between the two? Very unclear!<br/></code><br/>Yes: if we want to have a serious conversation about class we should get clear which conception of class we're using. I know that I have the Marxist model in mind, but tend to put my comments into a liberal framework for communication.                        </div>

                            Larry, I wrote that game.  It's called <i>Children of the Revolution</i> and you tell stories based on <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/twenty/mao1.html" rel="nofollow">Chinese revolutionary opera</a>, struggling against and eventually triumphing over class enemies.  It lost a local Game Chef competition to Jason Morningstar's <i>Grey Ranks</i>, though, so I need to polish it up for actual consumption.                        </div>

                            Brand, and to a lesser but noteable extent Jason, laid a fairly interesting smackdown on my sorry posterior, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I should also say I identify with the working class.  That's me, Mr. Working Class, hehe.  But my experience outside of where I grew up (being Las Vegas) was that most gamers were not working class, but college educated white people from professional backgrounds.  This idea was strengthened by occasional threads on places like RPG.net where folks would go out of their way to point out how many Ph.Ds and engineers they worked with and how cool and hip their groups are.  So, both by my own experience (which is, naturally, limited -- but I've belonged to gaming groups in Nevada, California, South Carolina and Maine and only in Nevada would I typify the group as "working class") and what I've seen on the Net (NOT representative of the general population) did seem to suggest that most gamers are white and middle class.<br/>
<br/>
That there is at least anecdotal evidence to suggest a larger working class presence that exists than one could see from the Internet and hanging out in game stores is interesting.  I also find it plausible.  I know too many of my working class friends who refuse to let go of ANYTHING until it is ABSOLUTELY BROKEN and are driving around in '63 GMCs as a result of this (salutory, IMO) attitude.  I believe a similar "if it isn't broke, don't fix it" attitude might go to gaming.  They LIKE blue box D&amp;D.  Why bother changing?<br/>
<br/>
But it changes, then, I think to whom we are reaching out and how we reach out to them.  Or at least complicates it a little bit -- because not only can we reach out to people who haven't ever gamed but we can also reach out to those gamers who game in solitude and towards whom there might be a class and/or racial divide.  I suspect a lot could be learned from them!  I mean, to talk to people who have been gaming for years and years and still keep doing it -- how they do it, why they do it, etc., strikes me as being something absolutely fascinating to learn (and raises the issue, I think, of all this online gaming theory -- to whom, really, is it all applicable if an unknown number of gamers game in relative obscurity).<br/>
<br/>
Still, I doubt that making a game about regular people will be the thing to bridge the divide of class, race or gender -- like with gender, I think the way change will happen is individual outreach and organization.  Both individually and institutionally, if people actually want to bring in these out groups, we'll have to find and encourage people to play.  That's my analysis, anyway.  Right now, I'm not convinced the problem is with the rules or the setting or the characters -- but merely that gamers are, perhaps, divided along classist lines.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that class is the undiscussed elephant in many American conversations.  It is part of our national mythology that the US has no classes, even tho' the US has the greatest divide between the rich and poor of any industrialized nation (and a greater wealth divide than a number of developing nations).  But we don't talk about class very often, and if a person does they're often attacked for bringing it up.  I'm not sure this is the proper forum to discuss it in more detail, so I won't, hehe.<br/>

I'm a socialist, but not a Marxist, and for the life of me I'm not sure how one would make a socialist game.  I've only half-thought about it, tho', hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I also make distinctions between games about Marxist events and an actual Marxist (or more generally socialist) game.  Any game could be about, y'know, the worker's struggles.<br/>

                            A socialist game would be a game that aims at raising the consciousness of the workers. Barthes comments (with reference to Chaplin's tramp) that Brecht says something about the necessity for revolutionary art to show people <i>without</i> consciousness, with their eyes still closed. That's something to chew on, but there must be many avenues.                        </div>

I think that Ben is v. right, too, in that a lot of class discussion occurs amongst people who are, f'rex, in the ivory tower and have never worked in a factory or a retail center or driving a truck or whatever (or, if they did, they did it not because they needed the money but to supplement buying luxuries).<br/>
<br/>
The military point is well taken, too.  Gaming is popular in the military.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking that the problem of class is that -- unsurprisingly -- people of different classes don't much talk to each other, and that game design (also unsurprisingly) largely has a middle-class bias -- that most game designers are college educated white men who (even if they aren't well paid; money doesn't have a huge amount to do with class) identify with the values of the middle class.  I'm still thinking, hehe.                        </div>

                            There was a black dude in a game group I was in for a while.  His story was one you hear a lot (I have no idea how typical it is) military service followed by college, first in his family to have made it into a decent paying job.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted nothing to do with urban, lower-class stories.<br/>
<br/>
His characters were usually black, usually either military or ex-military, and always solidly upper class, and had been for generations.  None of the PC's or NPC's ever paid any attention to his character's race, and he said that's one of the things he loved about gaming.<br/>

                            Fred, that is a cool anecdote.<br/>
<br/>
Okay then. One thing that occurred to me is that a lot of the tropes we've inherited for telling stories in general are already predicated on reinforcing the status quo. Campbell's monomyth, feudal stories of how virtuous the ruling class is, demonization of outsiders, all that. That RPGs got started in the feudal fantasy arena has perhaps limited their appeal to certain demographics. Anyone else notice that Gygax's version of fantasy cherry-picks the boyish, manly, or nerdy elements of fantasy while discarding numerous feminine, romantic tropes?<br/>
<br/>
Other tropes include classic American science fiction (Anglo-Saxon imperialism and jingoism!)<br/>
<br/>
So... is the whole matter of operating in the genre ghetto contributing to this problem?<br/>
<br/>
(I want somebody to say no, and why, because the above seems a bit like a cop-out to me, but I can't manage to discount it.)                        </div>

I can try to say "no", hehe.<br/>

I'm not sure this is true, but it seems to me the working class also accepts the validity (in large) of classic stories and storytelling styles.  So long as the working class shares in the literary and artistic biases handed down to them from the ruling class, I don't think that it is the case that the genre ghetto is a class problem (or, if anything, it favors the working class that doesn't matter as much about "taste" as the middle and upper classes -- the educated classes do tend to look down on fantasy literature even as it reinforces their status).                        </div>

                            Hi Larry,<br/><br/>Genre ghetto is a factor, though not the whole answer.  Even when folks attempt to break out of "genre ghetto" you run into the other issue of the power of definition- for example, "The Last Samurai" isn't about samurai or Japan, it's about the White American view of Japan.  Game-wise, we can point to stuff ranging from Legend of the Five Rings, Vampire, to Wyrd is Bond, etc.<br/><br/>Which then feeds back into the problem of unconscious power dynamics- "But the books says this!" backs up potentially erroneous or narrow stereotypes...  Who wants to deal with that in their fun?  <br/><br/>In fact, it plays back into a very real and problematic power issue of society- as Ben points out- folks claiming "authority" over telling people what their experiences are that they've never witnessed or experienced.                        </div>

                            I'm throwing an idea out there: yes, it's a huge problem for people to claim authority over others whose experiences they don't share, as Ben said.  Can we INSTEAD use role-playing to know those experiences, rather than trying to dictate and claim authority?  How can we make ourselves more 'other' in our role-playing experiences in an authentic way, without running into the problem of just playing what we already think and know about whoever we are trying to be?  That's a pretty radical thing to do, too, but a bad thing to fail at.  My solutions are a) research and b) immersion, but I don't know how effective they are, or if there's anything I can do to make them better.<br/><br/>As for the genre ghetto issue, in my very first job I ran a super-simplified FUDGE game for a group of low-income middle-school girls.  I talked to them a bit about setting and character before we started, and they were really uninterested in medieval fantasy.  Pirates, though - they were practically drooling about being pirates as soon as I mentioned the possibility.  Except one girl really wanted to have a horse, so we had a land-based chase scene where she got to break a horse in order to catch up to the guy who'd stolen her gold.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I also periodically run a game design class for inner-city fifth graders, and we do a brief section on role-playing games.  They seem to like pirates, ninjas, animal-character games, rock star/celebrity games, anything that feels like an action movie, and, my favorite, the kid who wanted to do a 'Ten Little Indians' game about people being murdered on an island one by one.  Next time I teach the course, I'm going to actually get them to do some really basic designs, not just talk about the kinds of games they'd like to play, so if I can get permission to share that data, I'll totally post about it here.<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS: Edited for clarity in first paragraph.  Instead of trying to dictate the experiences of others or talk 'down' about them, can we try to understand and share?<br/><br/>PPS: And yeah, that sounds incredibly hand-wavey, but I can't think of a more precise way to put it.  Sigh.                        </div>

                            Well, the fifth-grader thing is all volunteer.  It wasn't terribly hard to set up, though it helped that I have plenty of teacher contacts.  If there'd be interest, I could try to write up a little document this summer about "How to get into schools to teach game design" so that other people can do this too.  (If I have time, of course ....)<br/><br/>There are a couple of groups of people who are trying to take game design into the schools in a more organized way; I mostly know about ones in New York City and State, but if other people are curious, I could try to work my contacts and see what I can find out.<br/><br/>Sorry to derail things .... back to your previously scheduled discussion.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

No, I don't think that role-playing is a tool to give privileged people the right to speak for non-privileged people.  Done right, it *might* be a tool to further comprehension, but just because you can comprehend someone's problems does not give you the right to speak for them.<br/>

I'm not sure how I came across sounding like I think that role-playing gives one the authority to speak for another except in a fictional context.  What I <i>meant</i> is what you've said: to try to comprehend the problems of people who are truly unfamiliar, when you have no easy way to try to get to understand those problems in your real life.<br/><br/>Of course, I teach game design because I want to give people the tools to design games for themselves that express their own needs, concerns and voices.

                            I get that, Ben. But I'm not sure why you think it's missing the point (which point?) to call <i>Nicotine Girls</i> socialist. I'm just using it as an example of the strategy I talked about earlier.<br/><br/>The Girls are heavily exploited working poor (or lumpen), yet they dream trite petit-bourgeois dreams of fame, love, wealth. It's a game that makes people think about this invisible layer of society and themselves. It's consciousness-raising.                        </div>

                            I've got a Zola-inspired game (tentatively titled <i>Tabula Rasa</i>) which is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi game that focuses on the problems of the underclass that makes the society able to function.  I'm actually quite conscious that I'm designing the game to represent the lives of these people in a certain way, and to create a dynamic tension between social acceptance and social resistance.  That's one of the reasons I made it sci-fi/post-apocalyptic: so that I can say these things without actually claiming that I know what the day-to-day experience of, say, migrant workers in today's world is like, but still make the argument that I'm interested in, which is inspired by Freire and Zola.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>
