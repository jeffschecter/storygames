It sucked. <br/><br/>I believe the system is to blame here. It seems designed to prevent roleplaying fun. Some specifics:<br/><br/>- The setting-building phase is very short and results in very vaguely defined settings. This makes it hard to connect with people and events, since they have no grounding or context. <br/>- Players don't represent anything in particular, such as characters or factions. It's hard to care about a decision when you aren't on any particular side of it. <br/>- The Czege principle is thoroughly violated: the player who initiates a project always decides how it resolves. This feels arbitrary and unsatisfying. <br/>- The mechanics have no bite:<br/>--- Scarcities are barely felt during play, and there are no conseqences for failing to alleviate them.<br/>--- Contempt tokens have no effect on anything, including other players' reactions. This is mostly due to the second point above -- it's hard to care about another player's contempt when they clearly don't care all that much themselves. <br/>--- There are no consequences for ignoring a threat. Indeed, ignoring a threat nullifies it.<br/>- The rules limiting discussion make the game sterile and boring. The social aspect of story games is crippled. Players spend most of the game in enforced silence, twiddling their fingers. <br/>- The cards encourage the creation of multiple unrelated storylines. This makes the story feel disjointed and shallow.<br/>- The cards encourage creating characters, but the framework of the game prevents those characters from having any depth or any story arc. <br/>- Projects are "fire-and-forget": players have to stop thinking about a project just as it becomes interesting, and pick it up again when everyone has forgotten about it. This prevents anything dramatic from happening.<br/>- The game is designed to end with an unsatisfying anticlimax. <br/>- The Frost Shephards are left so vague that the ending is totally abstract. "The Frost Shephards arrive. The game is over." Well, what just happened? There's no answer. <br/><br/>It's not a good game, is what I'm saying. <br/><br/>So... am I missing something? Were we doing it wrong? Does anybody want to defend The Quiet Year?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434534/#Comment_434534" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T02:09:20+00:00" title="June 29, 2014  2:09AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does anybody want to defend The Quiet Year?</blockquote>\nYes I do. It's a game I much enjoyed. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>So... am I missing something? </blockquote>\nYes. The point of it all. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote>Were we doing it wrong?</blockquote>\nYessir.\n<blockquote>The setting-building phase is very short and results in very vaguely defined settings.</blockquote>\nThe setting-building phase lasts for the whole game. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote>Players don't represent anything in particular, such as characters or factions. It's hard to care about a decision when you aren't on any particular side of it.</blockquote>\nPlayers are alternately advocating for the community as a whole (which is not such a far stretch from the individual character advocacy we're used to) and providing antagonism/opposition to the community as a whole (which you know how to do if you've ever played as the Antagonist in Shock, the Mistaken in Polaris, the Producer in PTA, a "GM" in most games, etc.). The shift in role is not as strongly ritualized as in other games, that's all.<br/><br/>In either quality, according to my (limited) play experience, <b>bleed-in</b> is actually the strongest force behind player decisions here: you draw on what you believe makes communities thrive IRL, on your own sense of ethics, politics and social justice, on the utopias you daydream about and the beef you have with the society you live in.\n<blockquote>The Czege principle is thoroughly violated: the player who initiates a project always decides how it resolves.</blockquote>\nThat's because initiating projects is not the "conflict" you're looking for. That's somewhere else.\n<blockquote>Scarcities are barely felt during play, and there are no conseqences for failing to alleviate them.</blockquote>\nScarcities are part of the setting you build, not mechanical opposition. If you care about the scarcities you introduced, why do you ignore them then?\n<blockquote>Contempt tokens have no effect on anything, including other players' reactions. This is mostly due to the second point above -- it's hard to care about another player's contempt when they clearly don't care all that much themselves.</blockquote>\nMuch was written about contempt tokens both on this forum and elsewhere. Me, I think those are pure genius.<br/>But really, if players "don't care much", that alone means the game failed for you, I agree.\n<blockquote>The rules limiting discussion make the game sterile and boring. The social aspect of story games is crippled. Players spend most of the game in enforced silence, twiddling their fingers.</blockquote>\nThe rules limiting discussion point you straight toward the point of the game. With limited time and limited means to express yourself, you end up crippled in your ability to cooperate, acting as disjointedly as an actual community often does IRL. Disappointment builds up, but can only be expressed obliquely: this is what Contempt tokens are for \u2014they become your actual mean of expressing some of you feelings on side of the strict communication flow.\n<blockquote>The cards encourage the creation of multiple unrelated storylines. This makes the story feel disjointed and shallow.</blockquote>\nI feel that intertwined stories, part-disjointed but happening within the same community, is a more "realistic" style of narrative than most. The challenge to the players is to make sure individual threads have repercussions on each other, however distantly.\n<blockquote>The cards encourage creating characters, but the framework of the game prevents those characters from having any depth or any story arc.</blockquote>\nYou're not prevented from giving them depth. You're indeed not encouraged to plan artificial "story arcs" for them. Keep reincorporating named characters. Consider that your viewpoint is that of a history book or something.\n<blockquote>Projects are "fire-and-forget": players have to stop thinking about a project just as it becomes interesting, and pick it up again when everyone has forgotten about it. This prevents anything dramatic from happening.</blockquote>\nI think you're doing it wrong. Projects-in-progress are on the map, happening in the fiction. Do interact with unfinished projects (many cards do that). Never stop thinking about what's happening.\n<blockquote>The game is designed to end with an unsatisfying anticlimax.</blockquote>\nI call that "a poetic, suggestive ending", and that's why the Frost Shepherds *need* be left undefined.<br/><br/>But seriously, I'm not saying it's wrong to not like one particular game. It's just that the questions you're asking suggest to me that you were looking for another, completely different game \u2014 that you're disagreeing with all playstyle choices the designer made.<br/>How do you feel about comparable games such as Microscope or Chronicles of Skin? I'd say The Quiet Year is my favorite of the three.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434535/#Comment_434535" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T02:42:51+00:00" title="June 29, 2014  2:42AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2014 3:00AM by Oren.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Were we doing it wrong?</blockquote>\nYessir.<br/></blockquote>\nGreat!

The Spring cards already say things like "a young boy digs in the ground and finds something", which is an event, not setting background. But how should I know how people react to the thing the young boy found, when all I know about the community is "a forest with young spindly trees"?\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Players are alternately advocating for the community as a whole (which is not such a far stretch from the individual character advocacy we're used to) and providing antagonism/opposition to the community as a whole. <br/></blockquote>\nSay we're holding a discussion over whether we should go investigate those rocks over there. What does "advocating for the community" look like? Individual characters or factions might have various opinions, but as a player, I have no reason to be pro-rock-investigation or anti-rock-investigation. <br/><br/>About your second point: I don't know of any game in which players provide antagonism for themselves. And for good reason.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Czege principle is thoroughly violated: the player who initiates a project always decides how it resolves.</blockquote>\nThat's because initiating projects is not the "conflict" you're looking for. That's somewhere else.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nWhere's that? And what is the point of the Projects mechanic if there's no conflict involved?\n<blockquote><br/>Scarcities are part of the setting you build, not mechanical opposition. If you care about the scarcities you introduced, why do you ignore them then?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThere just don't seem to be many ways to interact with them. For example, we had a scarcity of seafood. So... Now what? We can start a project that alleviates the scarcity, but that's just a conflict-free way to eliminate it. Or we can Discover Something New that alleviates the scarcity -- ditto. There's no opportunity to do anything really interesting. \n<blockquote><br/>The rules limiting discussion point you straight toward the point of the game.

You're indeed not encouraged to plan artificial "story arcs" for them. Keep reincorporating named characters. Consider that your viewpoint is that of a history book or something.<br/></blockquote>\nI felt that I was prevented from giving them depth, for two reasons. First, the cards were always pulling us away from established events towards new things. Second, there are no played-out scenes, so characters have no real voice; they're pawns. \n<blockquote><br/>I think you're doing it wrong. Projects-in-progress are on the map, happening in the fiction. Do interact with unfinished projects (many cards do that).

I'd say The Quiet Year is my favorite of the three.</blockquote>\nI haven't played either (nor even heard of the second). Microscope sounds like I would enjoy it more, because it uses the "historic" viewpoint for a constructive purpose: skipping to the interesting stuff. Plus it has scenes, to give color to the events and character to the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434565/#Comment_434565" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T14:15:20+00:00" title="June 29, 2014  2:15PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2014 2:16PM by Scrape.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a person who was initially skeptically about the game but has come to love it, I gotta say that what you're reporting is what I <i>imagined</i> the game would play like. Most of the points have been covered, but I'd like to add something. You mentioned "what does it look like to advocate for the community during a discussion" and I can tell you what it looks like when <i>we</i> do it:<br/>Player 1: "I'm holding a discussion. The topic is 'should we excavate the ruins.' The Youth Brigade stands up and says 'Our past is our future, we're entitled to it. We should dig now!'"<br/>Player 2: "Among the grumbling Elders, an old man stands up. 'Absolutely not! Let the past stay buried!'"<br/>Player 1: (still taking the POV of the Youth Brigade) *grabs a Contempt token*<br/>Player 3: "The Priests speak in unison: 'There may be relics there of our lost Ancestors. We agree with the Youth.'"<br/>Player 2: (still taking the POV of the Elders) *considers a Contempt token, hesitates, and decides that the Elders respect the Priests and will follow their lead. Puts the token back down*<br/><br/>Something like that. Each player says what faction they're speaking for and then speaks for them. That's how we do it and it works for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434567/#Comment_434567" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T14:48:57+00:00" title="June 29, 2014  2:48PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We found that actual character voices developed  in "have a conversation" actions, but  they don't have a particular player in the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434568/#Comment_434568" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T15:28:05+00:00" title="June 29, 2014  3:28PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS It isn't a roleplaying game; although roleplaying does happen, it's not the predominant player action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434572/#Comment_434572" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T18:15:34+00:00" title="June 29, 2014  6:15PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that a lot of the fun is of the "filling in the blanks" variety: you take these vague elements like "a forest with young spindly trees" and "a young boy digs in the ground and finds something" and use them in a way that surprises/delights/horrifies everyone else at the table. In a good game session, people keep picking up and re-incorporating the details everyone else has been inventing, which provides the glue between the previously established events and the new things. If you think it's fun to throw out a crazy idea and see what other people do with it, and to take someone else's crazy idea and see what you can do with that, you can have a great time with The Quiet Year.<br/><br/>But yeah, there's not a lot of roleplaying in it. It's not really about creativity with characters and plot and situations, it's about creativity with setting and themes and brainstorming. And it plays fast, and produces an interesting artifact at the end (the map), which make it a fun pickup game to have on hand.<br/><br/>(Personally, I enjoyed it more than card games like My Dark Overlord and Once Upon A Time, or RPGs like Primetime Adventures or Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple.

If we play again we'll certainly adopt this style. In fact, we would probably define these factions up front, during the "detail-adding" phase before the first card.

You're right that it's not built into the system, and (I think) also right that it's not great if the person who came up with something is the only one interested in it. Avoiding that however you can is a good idea, whether it's just by everyone agreeing to, y'know, not do that, or by changing some of the mechanics around.<br/><br/>Me, I'd be worried that dropping the limitations on conversations would make the game take longer and interfere with people putting strange, unexpected spins on the things other people put into it. Something to watch out for, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434579/#Comment_434579" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T00:42:33+00:00" title="June 30, 2014 12:42AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like your group is fairly committed to a general notion of "ownership" analogous to the "each player controls his/her character" expectations of many traditional games.

By the end of the game, we were introducing T. Rex riders to our post-apoc setting, and I made a rule that all new building projects had to receive a majority vote to continue, and our new democracy ground progress to a halt. It was /interesting/ but it wasn't at all fulfilling. <br/><br/>I think we didn't connect to it because, while we managed to create a setting, we failed to create /story/. People connect naturally to stories. Maybe I'd go so far as to say that when we talk about /connection/, it's /because of stories/. You connect to another person when you learn their story. You connect to a place when you have a story there.<br/><br/>My play of The Quiet Year produced events, but no story. Maybe that's on us.

I took this to mean (and I think Rafu agrees with me here) that during a discussion we should each say whatever we would have said if we personally were in that situation, and/or something to make the discussion challenging or interesting, without representing any clearly-delineated group.

You keep saying the game stops you from doing things you want to do, but your only evidence is that it failed to force you to do them. If you want to create a coherent community where events build on each other and projects have meaning, you have to actually try to do that? If you want to feel like there are characters being developed and expressed throughout the game, you have to actually try to do that too. The thing about scarcities not mattering seems to be the pinnacle of the failure described throughout your experience: since the game didn't force you to do something, you decided it was impossible to do it, when in fact it was trivial to do so given the tools at hand.<br/><br/>I mean, you have to care about what you're doing. You have to have more thoughts about what is going on than you actually express through play. The Quiet Year is a game where most of the play happens in your head because there are limits on your means of expression, and it makes specific use of that tension. If you are used to always being able to talk about everything you are thinking about a game simultaneous to playing that game, it is definitely an adjustment to suddenly not be able to do that. But it doesn't mean you stop thinking about the game, and it doesn't mean the things you don't express aren't true or real or meant to affect play. They are -- that's the whole point, that most of the inputs into decisions in a community are not known to the other members of that community. That this creates interesting/frustrating results on how that community views itself. That it creates alienation of individuals from their community.<br/><br/>The only difference between the conversation Scrape portrayed and the rules as written is that the players speak out loud the name of the group they are representing. By the rules, the person or group represented is implicit in what they are saying; that person or group is the impetus behind the words, but they are not identified. If you decide that the only person or group you are going to represent is an analogue of yourself, inserted into the community, that works fine; if you decide you are going to represent a variety of viewpoints based on what you have imagined in your head about the community, that is also fine.<br/><br/>Wanting these groups to be not only explicitly named, but named in advance, is normal enough (and there were named Factions in early playtests of the game), but it is a decision that the designer has specifically avoided. But if 'the game doesn't make us name factions in advance' translates into 'therefore there are no meaningful factions' then you are in trouble, and will probably struggle to play the game. When I play the Quiet Year I spend a lot of time thinking about what factions might exist, and how they might feel about what is going on; I don't worry about whether or not they have a name, or are explicitly acknowledged in discussions. When those groups that exist in my head want to say something, or start a project, then I do that. The other players are presumably doing the same thing. Usually consensus emerges about what sort of groups exist, and what sort of opinions they have, but that consensus is volatile and implicit and changes over the course of the game. In much the same way, I would suggest, that actual social groups and movements in a community change over time. <br/><br/>I mean, the cool kids in my high school never sat down and wrote up a constitution, but their consensus opinions and influence were frequently expressed; they also changed dramatically over time, as the membership changed, or changed their opinions, or whatever. They didn't precede everything they said with 'as a cool kid, I think X' but we still knew which things they said were and were not part of that social construct. The cool kids didn't fail to exist, just because we never named them and wrote up a chart of their membership.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434635/#Comment_434635" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T22:10:27+00:00" title="June 30, 2014 10:10PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's not a good game, is what I'm saying. <br/><br/>So... am I missing something?

It sounds like the game isn't right for you.<br/><br/>When you say "staying silent neuters the player-to-player dynamic which is the core of these games to me" a little red flag goes up. Because I think you're evaluating The Quiet Year as a roleplaying game. It's not a roleplaying game. What are the "these games" you're thinking of? In my mind the games that TQY shares a lineage with are How To Host a Dungeon and Microscope. I've pitched it as "if SimCity were a poem" before.<br/><br/>I hear you saying that you want well-defined characters, linear story, conflict, roleplaying, and table talk. Those are great goals. The Quiet Year is not a good vehicle for them.<br/><br/>If you are dissatisfied with your purchase, I can offer you a partial refund.

There is such a thing as fictional support, and the game provides it in spades. You have to willfully disregard the fiction to avoid having factions and characters develop in play; almost any investment in the fictional premise of the game is going to produce those things, at least in your head. It seems to be that there is a notion that if you cannot take the things in your head and express them mechanically, then they are somehow not real or not supported by the game. This is not a helpful notion when playing TQY, or any other fiction-first game for that matter.\n<blockquote>What's to stop me from making 3 projects\u2014or even one discovery: "the garden of eden creation kit was found in a shed." and one project: "press the on switch"\u2014to solve every scarcity in the community? "just don't play in that way" isn't a good enough reason. </blockquote>\nReally? It seems like a good enough reason to me. It takes a significant amount of disrespect for the shared fictional world to simply obliterate large parts of it just because you can. If you want me to express this differently, the reason is 'investment in the fiction.'<br/><br/>But moreover, the game would hardly stop if you did introduce such a discovery, and such a project. In a group that is taking the game seriously, it would probably lead to a really interesting game, as the results of this machine would clearly influence/warp the existing community, etc. The scarcities are not the engine of the game, they are just one thing.

Like, why wouldn't you be invested? You decided to play the game? You thought the premise sounded interesting? You made up some stuff about a community? Some of that stuff you proposed, so presumably you liked it? Some of that stuff your friends proposed, so presumably you're interested in that too?<br/><br/>I mean, there's a huge jump between 'I'm not fully invested after five minutes' and 'therefore I will act destructively towards what exists.' It's true, sometimes people introduce scarcities you don't think are interesting, and sometimes even scarcities that you feel are actively bad -- though if they're so bad that they're going to actually make you dis-invest in the game, I strongly recommend speaking up about that. In the case of an uninteresting scarcity, you can just orient your play towards the other things you find interesting. If a scarcity is becoming disruptive, I see no reason why you might not propose a project that will fix it. As mentioned, I frequently play games with scarcities that are 'solved' by the very first project someone starts. The solution becomes part of the game going forward; it's not necessarily a negative or destructive action, unless someone is clearly interested in a more prolonged engagement with the scarcity -- and in that case they can easily discover new things about the solution, or the scarcity, or otherwise continue to act as though the scarcity is relevant.\n<blockquote>Reread the portion you quoted and maybe try to read charitably, or I'll have to take another contempt token. *spoilers* almost every game I have ever played succeeded at providing meaningful choices that interfaced with the mechanics *spoilers*<br/></blockquote>\nOkay, yes, but as I mentioned that is not the only source of meaningful choices in games, particularly in roleplaying games. The Quiet Year is mostly focused on other sorts of choices, though of course it does include some mechanically-interfacing choices, mostly in the form of the cards.<br/><br/>So with the charitable assumption that you also enjoy those other sorts of choices, is a game that focused on them necessarily problematic? Your language suggests that a game either fails or succeeds to provide these kinds of choices, but this overlooks the possibility that the game isn't even trying to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434702/#Comment_434702" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T10:00:34+00:00" title="July  2, 2014 10:00AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2014 10:01AM by Oren.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I feel like I dedicated a lot of the book to play advice. Specifically, "Who We Are" and "Restraint" and "Pacing" are all play advice (no mechanics are introduced in those pages). In addition, "The Opening Story" and the examples to be read aloud during the teaching of the game are all intended to set tone.</blockquote>\nI'd say "Who We Are" is very much about mechanics. It establishes that all players are equally in charge of creating problems and dealing with them (i.e. this game is more like Microscope than Apocalypse World). That's actually more fundamental than the cards and contempt tokens. I wouldn't say it establishes tone. Likewise, "Restraint" mostly introduces the "no free discussion" rule and reminds us not to play individual characters. These are mechanics.<br/><br/>I think maybe you intended the tone of the text inform the tone of the game, rather than setting the tone explicitly. To which I can only say that it was too subtle for me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But "Pacing" is the most problematic of the three sections you mentioned. I think it actively misled me about how the game ought to play out. It states that the community will start out with few threats, but by Autumn there will be serious conflicts and challenges to contend with. So I was under the impression that the gameplay is centered on creatively dealing with conflict and challenge, as in most (all?) roleplaying games.<br/><br/>On reflection, more than misunderstanding the tone of the game, I was blindsided by missing mechanics (as I saw it). If a game foregoes something as basic as conflict, this should probably be stated explicitly.\n<blockquote>Maybe something with the words "<i>ephemeral and poem-like</i>" would be useful?</blockquote>\nI think if I was trying to explain the game to someone (and keeping in mind that I'm still not claiming to "get it"), I would say that it's an introspective game. There are no goals to achieve and little interaction with the other players, so it's more about taking in the situation as it develops and mulling it over in your head.<br/><br/>Another thought: Vincent Baker (the grand master of GM advice!) says something in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> that might apply to <i>The Quiet Year</i> as well. He says the GM should take the characters' judgments and push them further: if a PC shows through action that he believes that "love is worth breaking the rules for". The GM should respond with a situation that asks, "really? Is <i>this</i> love worth breaking the rules for? Is love worth breaking <i>this</i> rule for?" A concrete challenge to the characters' beliefs as expressed by previous acts.<br/><br/>As applied to TQY, this advice might be phrased as: "find the place where the players disagree about the values and priorities of the community, and linger there."<br/><br/>Although I might be totally off base.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434703/#Comment_434703" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T10:05:42+00:00" title="July  2, 2014 10:05AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2014 10:06AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There [is]...little interaction with the other players</blockquote>\nThat's sort of interesting.

If you dislike that rule then ignore it. Nobody is forcing you to make those choices, so what if the rule encourages it? It's not the boss of you."<br/><br/>And that's perfectly valid, to an extent. But the reason we add rules to our make-believe time is because we want those rules to add something -- to guide play towards things we like and away from things we dislike, or to create an experience we probably couldn't create without the framework of the rules.\n<blockquote>Like D&amp;D4 combat tests tactics and teamwork, TQY tests your ability to, with extremely narrow channels of communication, get yourself and others on the same page..</blockquote>\nWhat about the opposite problem? In my session of TQY, we all started out more or less on the same page, and never had any interesting disagreements. Towards the end one player wanted to go colonize a volcanic island, but I thought there might be monsters there. So he started a project to colonize it anyway (and yes, I took a contempt token). So what now? I can Discover some monsters over there, I guess, but that seems petty. And otherwise, it just turns out that he was right and I was wrong, and we all end up agreeing again.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434711/#Comment_434711" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T12:08:22+00:00" title="July  2, 2014 12:08PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As applied to TQY, this advice might be phrased as: "find the place where the players disagree about the values and priorities of the community, and linger there."<br/><br/>Although I might be totally off base.</blockquote>\n"Linger there" is a great phrase, and totally good advice.<br/><br/>Don't necessarily force a conflict, but do linger (<i>via Holding a Discussion, via introducing additional supporting details through Discover Something New</i>) upon disagreements and trepidation.\n<blockquote>I would say that it's an introspective game.

Because you are building something communal, and you are working to parse various social cues about whether your community is <i>working</i>.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the mechanics won't tell you if your community is working.

To mirror what it actually feels like to engage a community in collective endeavour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434729/#Comment_434729" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T14:59:05+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  2:59PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually hate the answer "this game just isn't for you" but it really seems to be true.

This is not a helpful notion when playing TQY, or any other fiction-first game for that matter.</blockquote>\nI think this is a variation on the old "Rule 0" argument: someone says "such and such a mechanic is broken/weird/encourages things I dislike", and gets the response, "well, if you dislike those things then don't play that way. If you dislike that rule then ignore it. Nobody is forcing you to make those choices, so what if the rule encourages it? It's not the boss of you."</blockquote>\nThere is an enormous difference between something encouraging things you dislike and not encouraging things you like in a specific mechanical way. I am not suggesting you play against the game, I am suggesting you play the game the way you actually already seem to want to play it -- which is also actually the way the game is supposed to be played -- even in cases where you do not have explicit mechanical support. Because explicit mechanical support is not the only way a game can encourage or support certain types of play.\n<blockquote>And that's perfectly valid, to an extent. But the reason we add rules to our make-believe time is because we want those rules to add something -- to guide play towards things we like and away from things we dislike, or to create an experience we probably couldn't create without the framework of the rules.</blockquote>\nMost of your complaints seemed to center around the lack of specific rules support for specific things -- not about the existing rules not adding things. In any case, that was the notion to which I was responding. Many, many games offer only fictional support for crucial elements of their gameplay -- AW being the most obvious recent example. But really any game that relies on strong genre motifs is doing the same thing.\n<blockquote>What about the opposite problem? In my session of TQY, we all started out more or less on the same page, and never had any interesting disagreements. Towards the end one player wanted to go colonize a volcanic island, but I thought there might be monsters there. So he started a project to colonize it anyway (and yes, I took a contempt token). So what now? I can Discover some monsters over there, I guess, but that seems petty. And otherwise, it just turns out that he was right and I was wrong, and we all end up agreeing again.</blockquote>\nI am so confused by this. You talk repeatedly about how much you wanted your game to include conflict and disagreement and overcoming difficulties... but you never used any of the tools of the game to introduce any disagreement?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434779/#Comment_434779" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-03T09:35:44+00:00" title="July  3, 2014  9:35AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want it, here are some ways to get conflict in TQY using the rules:<br/>Discover a threat outside the community<br/>Discover a threat within the community: a mystery, a crime, a Bad Thing<br/>Discover a faction within or without the community that directly conflicts with their desires<br/>Hold a Discussion with an intentionally provocative topic ("should we wipe out all nonbelievers?")<br/>Start a Project like "Invade the neighbors" or "convert the heathens"<br/><br/>All of those can provide great fodder for conflict.
