It's inspired by Eastern history rather than Western medieval history, but I wouldn't say it's Chinese or Japanese or Indian or anything in particular. I borrow ideas from all over the place and try to twist them into something unique and original.<br/><br/><b>I'd love to riff ideas with you guys.</b><br/><br/>Topics:<br/><br/>* The nature of divinity and divine magic. (Starting here.)<br/>* <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/421277#Comment_421277" rel="nofollow">Elf Queens</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Divine Magic</b><br/><br/>So in this universe, ages ago, the elves and dwarves and humans worshiped decent gods and goddesses the way you'd expect in a typical FRPG world. Then the indecent deities from the underworld started winning the divine war. As hordes of demons started flooding through the gates of heaven, it looked like the forces of Evil would destroy the Good deities. The good races had very powerful magic by this point and used it to shut the gates to heaven and hell. This was a hard and permanent choice.<br/><br/>Shutting the gates of heaven meant no connection to deities anymore. That means:<br/><br/>* No divine spells.<br/>* Nowhere for souls to go when you die.<br/>* No parental deities proscribing morality nor punishments for violating the rules.<br/><br/>Over time, people solved some of these problems. They figured out that people produced divine mana through prayer, ritual, and belief. They refashioned their temples as efficient mana collectors and learned how to imbue their priests and monks with magical power (divine spells). <br/><br/>They quickly realized that disembodied spirits could be helpful or troublesome and developed funereal rituals to prevent a wide undead plague. Culture evolved to embrace a sort of spirit worship. Some people figured out how to capture spirits for magical purposes (new arcane spells) or for personal power ("leveling" by possessing spirits).<br/><br/>Without deities taking souls to heaven or hell, people are easily resurrected (into their own body, if it's not too damaged) or reincarnated (into any handy, empty body). It used to be hard; now it's easy. Not exactly cheap, so it's reserved for the wealthy. Hell, you can just "upgrade" from one body to another with a ritual, if you get tired of the old digs.<br/><br/>Philosophy has evolved. Elves follow a belief system based loosely on some elements of Buddhism and Taoism. Dwarves have a belief system based loosely on Confucianism. Mostly, they don't need gods anymore. Human religion evolved into an optimistic "some day our gods will come back to us, you'll see" system. <br/><br/><br/><br/><b>What are some other implications of this world?</b> Culture, religion, philosophy, magic, technology, and so on?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420820/#Comment_420820" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T09:32:42+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  9:32AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are disembodied souls indestructible?

It's very political. I think the temple priests are accountable through a hierarchy to larger temples and such, and there's probably a Grand Temple in the capital (though it'd be very interesting to let a kingdom other than the Empress' home kingdom control the church).

They used to go to temple when the gods insisted on it, but that was a long time ago. <br/><br/>Partly out of fear. People aren't 100% sure that the gods can't hear them. They only know that they can't hear the gods or receive power from them. Who knows, that could change, and then the faithless might be punished. <br/><br/>Partly because it's expected of them. There are societal pressures to go to temple. Where would you get married if you didn't have a temple? Who would cremate you?<br/><br/>Partly because it's enjoyable in its own right. Temple services include meditation and contemplation. <br/><br/>Partly because they want their temple to have power. Temples do protect their faithful. The temple provides food, healing, guidance, and protection. As the world is full of real dangers, some of which the average citizen is powerless to fight, the world needs empowered clerics.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421176/#Comment_421176" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-06T12:12:55+00:00" title="September  6, 2013 12:12PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When someone lays a dying curse on your head, you'd better watch out.

It seems it would change the dynamic between the priesthood and the populous, but I figure the priesthood could spin their message to keep people in fear of the gods' return and inevitable wrath.<br/><br/>It would be an interesting societal element, though; a Priesthood fully aware of their own hypocrisy, demanding the people worship a god they literally know is no longer listening, all because the act of worship still benefits the priests. Imagine the kind of person that'd take, to stand up there an lead a ceremony to an absent god knowing full well you are doing basically milking the congregation like cows, all while feeding the hopes and fears of the people you supposedly serve. You can't even hide behind your faith to convince yourself it's still in the name of your god, because you (more than ANYONE else) is acutely aware of your god's absence; that the prayers of the congregation will never be answered. <br/><br/>Is the ritual of worship enough, or does it require some level of faith to generate magic energy? Can the congregation simply go through the motions, or do they have to BELIEVE?<br/><br/>Imagine a priest in some small rural town doing the weekly rituals, only to find his supply of magic dwindling; the townspeople are still going to the ceremonies but are secretly losing hope and faith that they mean anything; only the priest knows, because the magic energy is shrinking. How does he reconcile that? How does he boost his congregation's faith in a god he knows is gone? (shudder).<br/><br/>EDIT: Even worse, let's say he uses his magic to boost their faith, only to find to his horror they are now putting their faith in HIM instead of the god, and it works; magic energy begins to climb, but now the town is building idols to HIS name. Does he allow this to continue; morphing his town in a cult for their own protection, but risking the wrath of the mother church?<br/><br/>(I wanna play this as a Dogs in the Vineyard variant)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421234/#Comment_421234" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T07:32:45+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  7:32AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I could see people using magic to make their own magical Hell as a prison for the really really bad souls that shouldn't be let back into the world.</blockquote>\n very Superman Phantom Zone, but it works well for this setting.

Nothing about the Opal Empire is off topic. <br/><br/><br/><b>Another thing I want to brainstorm: Elf Queens</b><br/><br/>There are four elf queens, each with her own kingdom named after the four seasons: The Spring Queen, the Summer Queen, the Autumn Queen, and the Winter Queen. The four queens are sisters, all very old (each more than a thousand years old). Effectively immortal, they hop from body to body as it suits them. <br/><br/>The appearance of their elven people suggest the seasons. Winter elves are pale white with ice blue eyes, etc. Cliche, but it works.  <br/><br/>The Summer Queen is currently the Empress of the Opal Empire. The queens vie for power and have settled into a sort of cold war. There's not much overt violence anymore but there is a lot of spying, economic sabotage, and the like. Other kingdoms have held the Imperial Throne in ages past.<br/><br/>The Spring Queen is inquisitive and not terribly aggressive. She has the best spy networks and the largest libraries. She has used her long life to become an expert on all manner of topics. She is a sort of philosopher and historian. She knows a lot about magical theory, but isn't necessarily the best at using it.<br/><br/><br/>I know next to nothing about the queens and their kingdoms. Ask me questions.

The eastern land of the Spring Queen is governed by Life and Wind, while the western lands of the Autumn Queen are the lands of Death and Earth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421383/#Comment_421383" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T11:26:58+00:00" title="September 11, 2013 11:26AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's the way I was thinking, Nick. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421400/#Comment_421400" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T18:06:25+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  6:06PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's some cool depth there.

They live thousands of years. They typically don't fight with armies outright, unless it's very profitable.  Also, this whole thing is based more on Eastern culture than Western culture. The rest is up for grabs.<br/><br/>I'm gonna swap Order and Chaos for the Summer and Winter Queens.<br/><br/><br/>The Spring Queen (also Life, Wind, East) is all about collection of knowledge. She's a genuinely good person, but she's not stupid or naive. She's ambitious, too, and has great ideas about how she'd rule the Empire. Truth be told, she'd probably be the best at it, but her Summer sister is more devious than her and more willing to break things in the long term for short term power.<br/><br/>The Summer Queen (also Order, Fire, South) rules the Opal Empire as Eternal Empress. I imagine her as fierce and decisive, but short-sighted. She can be vindictive and jealous, a little hot-tempered when crossed. She has a court full of husbands and male consorts, plus a huge number of other servants set up in an ancient hierarchy. She's a bit of a political "chess player" but she can be a little impatient so she often has to compensate for her blunders with military might.<br/><br/>The Winter Queen (also Chaos, Ice, North) to be the opposite of cold. She's often disarmingly warm, friendly, and helpful. She is probably also the meanest of them and the cruelest schemer. She's manipulative and prone to mood swings. When she feels slighted, she can be very petty and passive-aggressive. Unfortunately, she finds slight easily. She gets along with her sisters well enough but pits them against one another. <br/><br/>The Autumn Queen (also Death, Earth, West) is approachable, practical, and calm. She has a bit of a flat affect but she inspires trust in people. She is the most philosophical of the four sisters, constantly contemplating how things begin and end. She is patient but moves quickly to take advantage of rare opportunities, especially those she's carefully set up over decades or centuries. In her mind, everything is going according to plan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421681/#Comment_421681" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T17:58:26+00:00" title="September 19, 2013  5:58PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The four queens are four Icons for the game right?  Which makes me wonder what my other choices would be for an Icon to follow.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the gods or lords that the four queens pulled down?  Like the lord of the gates of heaven?  I'm sure he must still have a cult hanging about, trying to get those gates opened and their old lord back in power.  <br/><br/>What about the Icons that want to become gods but need to pull down the four queens before they can do it?  The Lord of Void and Great Old Tree would like to move on up and take some power, I imagine.  <br/><br/>And what might happen if the four queens are deposed?  If the Summer Queen is removed from her throne, does the world no longer get a summer?  If not, I'm sure that's what she's willing to tell everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
