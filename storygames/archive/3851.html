The different episodes have different structures and "feel" to them, and there are different characters and guides (GMs), so even if the first one should be a bit clunky, the next one can still be great. The last episode, with all four players portraying characters locked in a train going to Dachau, focuses strongly on character portrayal - acting and immersion at the same time. It's one of the best pieces I've ever written, I think.<br/><br/>The first episode has very little real player influence. Not only is it strongly scripted, but the protagonists are an old couple in a completely hopeless position. There are two reasons for doing it like this: So that the players will have some time to get acquainted with the basic format, and to show the hopelessness of the situation. It builds up to the next episode, which is the assassination of a German diplomat by the old couple's son. Historically, and in this piece, that assassination was the official excuse for the Kristallnacht.<br/><br/>The very first bit of Episode A (the dinner &amp; prayer) haven't been playtested yet. The rest has been played some four or five times, I believe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86500/#Comment_86500" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T09:15:54+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  9:15AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>This is fascinating from so many perspectives.

The procedures are identical.\n<blockquote>I think I'd have a hard time "playing" this, too (it's anything but<i>play</i>, which is worth considering as you position this project for sharing with a wider audience).

That's why I'm not calling it a "role-playing game" anymore - the clunky working title is "interactive piece", and at this point it actually has much more in common with theatre than with D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Personally, I think it could be called an RPG, but I have a very, very wide definition of the term. I've gone through the blog removing all reference to "players" and "games"; this is because calling Kristallnacht a "game about the Holocaust" is very misleading.<br/><br/>At the moment, I'm thinking of this as something to be used for educational purposes - and for those with a special interest in the Holocaust, or in experimenting with the role-playing format.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86514/#Comment_86514" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T09:52:01+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  9:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Because I'm German and have very strong feelings about all the horrible suffering of that time period.

Those who have tried Kristallnacht have all been Norwegian; none have (to my knowledge) experienced anything remotely like the events portrayed in Kristallnacht. There are reports of strong experiences, but I don't know what anyone with first or second hand experience of the subject would make of it - or, indeed, whether they'd be inclined to try. <br/><br/>At this stage, however, it's meant as an educational project - I picture the target audience being 16-20-year-olds learning about the Shoah or WWII in general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86519/#Comment_86519" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T09:58:03+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  9:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's negative in the sense that it's too painful for me.
