The basic <i>Protocol</i> system involves drawing cards to determine character traits, motivations, and scene inspiration. However, the core <i>Protocol</i> book arrives with over twenty different variations on core rules the tweak the game to accomodate different genres and settings. You can also purchase the different <i>Protocol</i> variants individually if you just want to dip your toe into the system.<br/><br/>The feel of <i>Protocol</i> is decidedly more dramatic than <i>Fiasco</i>. <i>Protocol</i> also provides players with more inspiration to draw on for their individual scenes. I have found that with less confident role players the open-ended <i>Fiasco</i> can be intimidating. The game stars out with a familiar assigning and defining of relationships. However Protocol aslo provides individual scene setting suggestions. For instance the game we played was a variation called "Plague," it was about the entier country being turned into a quarantine zone- the first scene we drew was "sending out a radio signal."<br/><br/><i>Protocol</i> really shines in the "suit system." When drawing for scenes each suit is tied to one of five unique scene types:<br/><br/> 1. Interludes: These are the standard two person scenes you might be familiar with from Fiasco. They are generally character driven.<br/><br/> 2. Ensambles: These involve the full cast and are generally focused more on plot.<br/><br/> 3. Interrogations: These are pretty interesting. They can either be one or more characters asking another character questions, or you can take a reality show "confessional" approach and ask the character questions sperate from your larger plot.<br/><br/> 4. Vignettes: are descriptions of environment and scenery. There is little to no character interaction in these scenes. The create a sense of space and mood. Think Terrence Mallick style shots of nature.<br/><br/> 5. There is an optional rule to play with jokers. If you do the joker calls for a character monologue<br/><br/>Overall <i>Protocol</i> is a great, quick play no prep game. <a href="http://peachesandhotsauce.com/podcasts/60-protocol" rel="nofollow">You can listen to our playthrough right here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438218/#Comment_438218" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T12:46:09+00:00" title="September  9, 2014 12:46PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i agree. protocol sounds awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
