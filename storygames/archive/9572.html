If they're all dynamic then there's too much going on to make for a reasonable Chapter.  Sometimes what you need is an element that can be repurposed to slot into a conflict that's created by other elements' dynamism.  Rather than the Oracle entry being dynamic, its position in the burgeoning relationship map of best interests make it dynamic.<br/><br/>All static elements is less helpful...too much to invent to really get going strong out of the gate.  But all dynamic I think is too hectic.  Too much going on makes things more confusing than exciting.  Also,  if you have too many dynamic things its too easy for players to focus on their own little piece.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Then fuck, dynamic it up. OTOH, if your group has a strong "fuck each other with best interests" vibe already going on, nut has trouble coming up with unique characters or brilliantly painted situations, then focus the oracles on ones that create those unique characters and brilliant situations. <br/><br/>If you're designing not for your own group, but a con game or some such, then consider the tone of the game you want to run. Do you want to limit player input in order to get immediate, if perhaps slightly stilted results? Then tell us what the swordsman is doing so that we can all get going. Do you want to have a game where players imprint their own moral or aesthetic impressions on characters? Then most certainly do not tell us what the swordsman is doing, we need to make that up ourselves. <br/><br/>If you're designing for what the average poster on Story Games wants, well, you're fucked. So I suggest not doing that.<br/><br/>Personally, for me and the folks I often play with, I like to have oracles that imply imbalance without being specific about the cause or course of it. Hordes of angry barbarians (why are they angry? where are they going? who do they want to kill? Don't tell me, this is what I will make up), vindictive sorcerers (vindictive why? against whom? will carry it out in what way? Don't tell me, this is what I will make up), swords with wyrd destinies (just as the previous two, don't tell me the damn destiny, that's mine to make up) -- these are great for me, as long as I'm not told what they are or what they're doing. I like oracles that act as a spur, rather like a Rorschach blot, to get me to fill in my own blanks rather than ones that try to do it for me. I want the oracle to give me something I might not have thought of rather than some overly detailed description of something I always think of and now am rather constrained by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212469/#Comment_212469" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T16:44:02+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  4:44PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>That is to say, do you want an oracle that explodes out the gate because your group has problems taking implied situations and making them dynamic?

I played IAWA a couple weeks ago with three players who mostly fit into that first category. We drew four elements (from the Nest of Vipers oracle) that were on the vague side, and it took a little more effort than usual to get things going.<br/><br/>There's also the thing where some elements have a pretty explicit "character" present, and others do not. In my recent game, none of the elements had a clear-cut character, so that made the character creation process (which is usually fun and brilliant) harder going than usual.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212549/#Comment_212549" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T06:17:17+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  6:17AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2009 6:18AM by Ry.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>If you're designing not for your own group, but a con game or some such, then consider the tone of the game you want to run.
