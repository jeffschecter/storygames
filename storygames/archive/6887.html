It seems like the best way to do GM-less (granted, I'm FAR from being an expert on this game) would be to have players use their primary PCs but also run NPCs when necessary and especially when their PC isn't involved in a scene.

One of the best things about IAWA, especially with two players, is suddenly <i>getting</i> your PC involved in a scene. And the best scenes are between PCs, anyway. <br/><br/>I'd be worried about giving people that comfort blanket of playing an NPC. If they feel left out because they're not involved, then <i>good</i>. They'd better find a way of getting themselves involved.<br/><br/>(I'm not quite explaining this right, but there's something very powerful about the GM playing all NPCs, and something worrying about upsetting that balance).<br/><br/>Really, I'd play it straight. One GM, two players, GM plays all NPCs, exactly by the rules. Rotate the GM at the end of a chapter, if you'd like to.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153337/#Comment_153337" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T08:10:48+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  8:10AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.  Well, I'll withold any  more comment until I've at least read the book and played once.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Not sure when I'll actually get to play it, but hopefully soon.  Then I'll think about this idea more.  I'm always hopeful that I'll manage to recruit another person or two into my group as well... so who knows?  Maybe I can get a 4 or 5 person group going for IaWA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153342/#Comment_153342" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T09:06:23+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  9:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, did I say GM-less?

There are other reasons why it's good to have particular strengths on separate sheets.  You can choose to add a new particular strength when a characters comes back for another chapter, and unless it is unique, multiple characters can have the same particular strength.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DainXB</cite>Technically, as I understand it, the way it works with unique items that are particular strengths is that you can negotiate for the loser of the challenge to mark it off his sheet, but the winner can't write it on<i>his</i>sheet.

If it's only a fictional change, that would mean the winner wouldn't be able to use the dice or other mechanical benefits of the stolen item though, right?<br/>It seems to make sense that characters should be able to steal one another's items and use them; what trips me up is the last bit under "Don't negotiate for . . ." on page 19 about improvements to the winner's character sheet, since it seems like adding a particular strength would be an improvement.  It does seem like temporary theft or non-guaranteed theft might work though, which is cool...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153698/#Comment_153698" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T11:34:52+00:00" title="June 29, 2008 11:34AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>So I played tonight with two of my friends.</blockquote>\nDid you go "GM and two players" or "GM-full"?  <br/><br/>Any thoughts on the group dynamics with three people playing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153699/#Comment_153699" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T11:45:39+00:00" title="June 29, 2008 11:45AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I GMed.  it went okay.
