The <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20730/london-by-moonlight" rel="nofollow">last thread </a>was a big help in firming up the world of London by Moonlight. Now, I would like to discuss the system.<br/><br/>The goal I am going for is a system that is a hybrid of story game and traditional RPG. Primarily, I want the ease of setup, coherent rules, and emotional depth of a story game and still have the "long game" potential of traditional roleplaying. I've started a ruleset that is still currently in Alpha status. Its called Dream System and you can download it from <a href="http://thefaelands.com/free-stuff/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. So far, it is just the Character Creation and Conflict chapters, but there is more to come. I would greatly appreciate some feedback to see if I am on the right track.<br/><br/>Some of the particulars of the game that may not be obvious:<br/><br/>1.) Uses the GM/Player dynamic - Yes, I went with this traditional arrangement. I actually had to throw out some pre-alpha rules because they would work better with a GM-less game.<br/><br/>2.) The rules are meant to be somewhat generic - Dream System is meant to cover 3 interlocking worlds so far.<br/><br/>3.) I am attempting to use the mental tools used by authors to create stories - I haven't some of this stuff down yet. For example, I am going to attempt to use the 3 Act story structure when it comes to creating adventures. I'm not particularly in love with the Character Creation system. I'm sure it would work, but it also seems rather "meh.' I do want the players to be able to make their characters quickly and easily.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456201/#Comment_456201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T08:59:01+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  8:59AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to do the bad thing I do, which is to read your document and write my comments here at the same time, so brace yourself for my unleashed stream of consciousness.

Messy, since I consider this the core mechanic of the game, but I was still transitioning the system away from an auction mechanic. I personally like an auction, but its too easy to abuse. Or, at least it would have the perception of abuse by the GM unless I came up with something to make it more fair.\n<blockquote> - The questions are presented as a "Will I succeed at X?" format, but could you also have "What will the price of my success be?" as a question?</blockquote>\nInteresting idea.

They are a general placeholder for things that the player or GM can come up with that may be of future benefit. The Fast Levels act just like the Levels of a Trait.\n<blockquote> - The example of play starts off without referencing the rules for conflicts, with the GM putting a card forward with the current obstacle in the scene written on it. I would guess this is an example of adding Details?</blockquote>\nPrecisely. One of the things I liked about the abandoned Auction mechanic is that the player and GM would bid Tokens to get the outcome they wanted, but they needed to narrate what those bids represented in the flow of the Conflict.\n<blockquote> - Actually, that example of play may not be the best one: it's a situation where the GM doesn't really care about the outcome, they're just throwing in a speed bump, and the outcome itself doesn't really do anything, it just adds a bit of colour to the narrative.

More, please! </blockquote>\nA little more on Facts. They can be anything, as long as they are related to the current action. A possible Fact in the example could be that the Character finds an ornate dagger at the bottom of the pit, or they manage to flip up out of the pit with such mastery that it impresses the Princess that is travelling with the group.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456267/#Comment_456267" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-13T22:43:40+00:00" title="September 13, 2016 10:43PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the auction system was superior in so many ways, except for a certain way it could be abused, I'd recommend playtesting it, and just telling the players not to abuse it.<br/><br/>If it's really fun, then you can brainstorm for a rule or limitation to prevent the abuse, if necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456268/#Comment_456268" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-13T23:10:21+00:00" title="September 13, 2016 11:10PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There is really nothing to say about the character creation system.

Character Creation Alpha 3 should allow the players to define their Traits better by allowing them to choose a Body Trait, Mind Trait, Profession Trait, etc. These categories can be changed to fit the setting the Characters are to play in.\n<blockquote>The conflict system is deceptively simple, but such system need a ton of meta-rules like priciples and agenda to make them work.

The Character gets to escape from the pit, but doesn't get to do it cleanly. You're right in that it really isn't a good example. I really think that including other possible results in an example would make things clearer.<br/><br/>Currently, the weakness of the current mechanic is the high amount of randomness when there isn't a high Trait Level to help insure success. I haven't completely worked out how I want damaging conditions to work in the game yet. At the time I wrote the Alpha 1 document, all I had was "Save or Die" in mind. Now, I think that something like a "No, but.." in that situation, could produce a lesser effect, like a Wound instead of the Goal of Death.<br/><br/>Good stuff, guys!

I think its possible to limit what the GM/Writer can do. For example, Prime Time Adventures limits the Producer to using only up to 5 cards in any one conflict. However, when I ran that game for my friends, I was continually accused of being able to overwhelm the players at any time, despite that limitation. I think this was primarily because they didn't understand that 5 was an absolute limit. It was Perception vs Fact. Everyone knows the GM can crush you at any time, but having a pile of tokens in front of you that allows everyone to see this may prove to be too much for some.<br/><br/>The original allure of the Auction was that the Player that wins each Conflict slowly weakens. For each win, they must pay a Token to the Bank (or, perhaps, to the losing player). If they narrate something that pleases the other players, they can pay that player a Token from the Bank.<br/><br/>It would make for a very tight system. Inherently, it wouldn't allow for mixed results, but it would be possible to allow the players to throw possible "buts" into the bid narration. "The price of success," as James put is in his post.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456292/#Comment_456292" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-14T07:35:39+00:00" title="September 14, 2016  7:35AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's a hypothetical alternative to <i>save or die</i>, one that I tend to use a lot in my games as it keeps the narrative moving forward and it's what I was referring to when I mentioned the "price of success."<br/><br/>Your example of play can be simplified to "Can I get out of this pit?", but what if we assume that the PC <i>will</i> get out of the pit successfully?

For example, getting separated from your friends might be a small, interesting setback, so the player would be happy for the result to turn out either way, but getting injured or losing precious time might be of more critical importance, so players will stake more of their resources to avoid that fate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456297/#Comment_456297" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-15T00:50:46+00:00" title="September 15, 2016 12:50AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So here's a hypothetical alternative to <i>save or die</i>, one that I tend to use a lot in my games as it keeps the narrative moving forward and it's what I was referring to when I mentioned the "price of success."</blockquote>\nJames, this has me intrigued.

Gaining access to the politician is obviously going to be a challenging task, as it's been established in the fiction that they are not an accessible figure, so some kind of conflict check is required, <i>but</i> if the PCs fail, then the story comes to a stop.<br/><br/>I like to use the "price of success" model in response to "good bad ideas" like that, because I don't want to block the interesting scene from happening: if the obstacle is a minor one, like a locked door, I might even say that the PCs get through it without trouble. I did things like that several times during a Primetime Adventures game I ran recently, as that's a very character-lead drama with light definition of skills &amp; abilities; in short, don't put things at stake that will prematurely end the game (for that character at least.)<br/><br/>As to assuming the PCs can always succeed if they pay enough... well, why not? If they're the heroes, shouldn't they be confident in their successes? The key lies in that concept of 'paying': what happens when they have nothing left to pay? This doesn't only apply to a resource-based system, where the players can literally run out of dice to roll, but to any story where the PCs care about things beyond themselves: if what's at stake is the life of an NPC they care about, they might well be prepared to sacrifice their own lives to achieve the greater goal.<br/><br/>In short, I aim to fail forward and avoid outcomes like "Nothing happens" or "You lose, game over." This <i>sometimes</i> means assuming the overall success of a task, with the conflict being used to determine what the price of that success is, until the PC has nothing left to lose but themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456308/#Comment_456308" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-15T14:00:17+00:00" title="September 15, 2016  2:00PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent post, James. There's another very useful tool in that, uh, family bucket.<br/><br/>It's "you succeed, but it's not what you hoped for". <br/><br/>This is where the character's attempt goes forward and more-or-less accomplishes their aims, but the context - or the perception - is subverted. It's another form of "yes, but". It initially looks like a success - the character appears to have achieved what they wanted - but they don't *really* get what they wanted.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>"Yes, you manage to escape from the TIE fighters by hiding inside an asteroid. But it turns out that your hiding place is actually inside the maw of a giant space worm!"<br/><br/>"Yes, she agrees to go on a date with you. But it turns out she's just pretending to like you so she can write about the date in the newspaper the next day, to humiliate you in front of the whole school."<br/><br/>"Yes, you do manage to identify the body of the victim, despite horrible damage. Much to your surprise, it's your own brother."<br/><br/>Like "success, with an unsustainable price", it's really a form of failure.<br/><br/>Someone recently pointed out that in fiction, protagonists usually *don't* get what they want. They are denied again and again and suffer terrible outcomes. As a game design scene, shouldn't we be looking to emulate good fiction?<br/><br/>However, I think that the "yes, but" model has been adopted for good reasons in game design. "No, and" removes the agency of the protagonist and shifts the entire creative burden onto their opposition. "Yes, but", however, is a fruitful combination of the protagonist's desires (the "yes" part) and the opposition's ideas (the "but" part). In this way, the game is pushed forward while taking into account the ideas of both players involved, and develops, always moving forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456314/#Comment_456314" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-16T01:45:35+00:00" title="September 16, 2016  1:45AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James.. Paul. I thank you both.<br/><br/>The Price of Success may make for an interesting diceless game mechanic. As Paul pointed out, this kind of mixed success is indeed a part of fiction, and that is definitely one of the goals I want for the system.<br/><br/>This reminds be somewhat of Theatrix. In that game, success and failure hinges entirely on whether the plot demands it. Did the hero fall into a pit trap, but his death would stop the story? Then he manages to successfully not die. It's just a matter of how he manages to do it. Has the villain been spotted and the heroes are chasing him down the street? And its too soon in the story to catch him? Then he crosses a busy street and vanishes as the view of him is obscured by a large van.<br/><br/>I've been waffling between Dice and Auction for weeks now. Dice provide unexpected results, but that can also be a bad thing if something bad happens that you didn't intend. The Auction mechanic is effective and mostly predictable, but a player may feel picked on if the Writer keeps upping the ante against them.<br/><br/>I have an idea jelling. What if the Writer needs to use one of three basic success models in a Conflict situation?<br/><br/>1.) Must Succeed.<br/>2.) Must Fail.<br/>3.) Doesn't Matter.<br/><br/>Doesn't Matter runs the entire spectrum of success and failure:<br/><br/>Yes, And...<br/>Yes...<br/>Yes, but...<br/>No, but...<br/>No...<br/>No, and...<br/><br/>Must Succeed only goes as low as "Yes, but..." and Must Fail will only go as high as "No, but..."<br/><br/>I hope that makes sense.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456315/#Comment_456315" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-16T01:53:04+00:00" title="September 16, 2016  1:53AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your specific problems are quite resolvable, though.

This is just something my mind leapt to when I tried incorporating the Price of Success concept into what I've done so far.

If the player doesn't have enough Tokens to bid for success, they can pay for it by mixing in a little Failure. Separation from the Party would be worth a Token, as would losing an important item. <br/><br/>After thinking about it further, the mechanic doesn't need to be diceless, That's just what I ran with.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456335/#Comment_456335" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-16T23:40:25+00:00" title="September 16, 2016 11:40PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, that's actually pretty interesting.<br/><br/>You have a blind auction.

What if whenever a PC brings their handicap into the fiction, in a situation in which it would be disadvantageous to do so, they earn a one free level that they can apply to help them during any confict roll. For example, let's say that the PCs weakness is "Hot Headed" but they need to be diplomatic in order to get some info from an NPC--(the PC brings their handicap into the fiction)--but instead of playing it cool when the NPC mentions something political their Hot Headed trait kicks in and they complicate their goal...they then earn the level...and act out the rest of the scene.

Had some ideas spinning around in my head for a couple of days, but I think I've got something solid now.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I originally wanted to do an open auction is because I had been inspired by a game called <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=4627.0;wap2" rel="nofollow">Kathanaksaya</a>. I loved how the players bid back and forth, adding actions and story elements to the narrative as the conflict progressed. It's this back and forth narration that feels like the natural rhythm of a shared story.<br/><br/>Another reason I have for the open auction is that I would like to play <a href="http://thefaelands.com/category/londonbymoonlight/" rel="nofollow">London by Moonlight</a> online. I've set up a Roll20 account for this purpose, and an open auction would be easier to do in chat than a blind one.<br/><br/>Here's what I have to put together so far:<br/><br/>We do away with Success/Failure. Instead, the goal of the Conflict is to be one the one that narrates the outcome. Success and Failure could probably come into the mechanic, but I think that the player would tend to narrate success for the character and the Writer would tend to go with Failure.<br/><br/>The player(s) and opposition bid back and forth, using either Story Elements or Tokens as their bid, building up to the outcome. The one with the highest bid gets to narrate.<br/><br/>After the bidding comes negotiation. If they failed, the player can offer a concession in order to get the narrative. How much the concession is worth is measured in Tokens.<br/><br/>1 Token to allow the player to narrate the But.<br/><br/>2 Tokens if the opposition gets to narrate the But.<br/><br/>X Tokens if the opposition gets to give the player a number of Black Tokens that can be used against them sometime later in play.<br/><br/>If the number of Tokens taken on exceeds the winning bid, the player may narrate, but must allow for a mixed result in the narration.<br/><br/>How's that for a start?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456370/#Comment_456370" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-19T02:18:49+00:00" title="September 19, 2016  2:18AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I really like a lot of the ideas you have so far.

You've actually stated some of the things I have in mind for Dream System. I'm sorry about the lack of detail, but I haven't gotten all of it done yet. And I am also trying to avoid what I call a "redesign cascade." One change to a basic, but integral, part of the game can impact the rest of it. I just don't like rewriting rules if its not necessary. Once we get the Conflict rules pretty much where they need to be, I can move on and you guys can see the rest of the system.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
