I know the easiest way to avoid all this is to givo no XP and just tell the players when their characters level up, introduciong a resting time that allows their characters to train and learn new class features and skills. However now I'm trying to think of a way to have PCs level up bit by bit while playing.<br/><br/>What I've told my group of players so far is that they'll receive their level and class features bit by bit, so only when they get those, all their characters would be officially level 2. I'm hoping this will also give them time to get used to each new feature (not that they are too many per level in 5e anyway, but as new players they haven't even get used to all their current features so far. It's just their second session anyway so no trouble so far I think) <br/><br/>Yet that isn't enough for me, I'd also like to make everything make sense story-wise. Like, I dunno, they get more HP right after they get a long rest after a series of difficult encounters, because now they have learned how to take a beating and got their resistance up or something. Now the challenge is to make up more excuses like that or see what else could trigger PC development in a certain way. Party members are an elf Monk, two rogues (one is a tiefling girl and the other is a gnome tinkerer) two paladins (one human, one dragonborn but raised by dwarves), a dwarf cleric and a dragonborn bard.

The only solution I've seen to this is to make sure every skill use has risks or costs or something associated with it -- "if there's nothing at stake, you can't roll", basically.  <br/><br/>Not sure if that can be made to fit with D&amp;D.  If you're game for that, though, then I think you can tack some sort of "does it advance?" procedure onto what the characters do -- either mark off incremental boxes, Burning Wheel-style, or make percentage rolls against the current score, [can't remember]-style, or something else.  If you tend to roll for all the important stuff the PCs do, then that's your advancement-tracking trigger; if they do a lot of non-rolling stuff that would advance them, then you can either (a) keep an eye out as GM or (b) establish some sort of Key or Milestone deal where you all know in general what the character is striving for and it's easier to spot and reward that.  <br/><br/>Sorry if all that was too generic, I hope there's something useful in there...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443222/#Comment_443222" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T00:32:28+00:00" title="February 25, 2015 12:32AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about a simple concept of "achievements", which could be GM-dictated some of the time and negotiated with the player some of the time?<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>"Anyone who defeats the Crag Troll gets an extra Hit Die."<br/>"Anyone who discovers the Lost Tome of Bla-Bla-Bla learns two new spells; or, if a non-magic-user, gets a +1 to save vs. spells."<br/>"Anyone who is a veteran of the Battle of Grimcastle gets a +1 to hit."<br/><br/>Or:<br/><br/>"You want to get a 'Trick Shot' feat?

Sean Reynolds (formerly of Paizo) used to have a bit on stepwise level advancement posted on his site but it seems to have been pulled. Essentially, you break up the XP and class features for each level and let players choose how to level up in a more granular fashion. Example: every 1/4 XP, players select skills, HP, saves, or class specific pieces to advance - at the fourth advancement they are fully at the next level. <br/><br/>I've recently found the Key system which goes a step further: reward XP based only on specific character goals the player has chosen.

Any ideas?</blockquote>\nSounds like a way to drive yourself and your players insane to me. Levels are about as arbitrary and fiction-agnostic as it gets. One obvious solution is to simply have advancement work altogether differently, and use levels descriptively; i.e. a character is level 2 once they have advanced sufficiently, via whatever other method you decide to use. <br/><br/>The number of possible other options are, well, as infinite as the number of character-advancement-oriented RPGs ever written. There are literally hundreds of ways to model character advancement -- I think you'd want to start by listing out your priorities, and thinking about how far you are willing to diverge from the existing D&amp;D ruleset. It will be a lot easier to get constructive advice -- or recognize a useful answer/system when you encounter it -- if you get a more solid idea of what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443246/#Comment_443246" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T17:04:07+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  5:04PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2015 5:07PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it has to be way too difficult, though it's going to be a bit of an extra work. What I had in mind was checking what the upcoming class features would be for each player, considering both their class and race, and then introducing in the narration some scenes or even just add details on certain scenes to show how their characters grow up. Whenever it's a feature where they have to choose, I can narrate how they find themselves at a disyuntive point in their training, tell them what could await at the end of each path, let them take the choice and announce later in another session how they finally achieve success after training in that direction.<br/><br/>For example, I see in the PHB that at level 2 the bard will get two new features, jack of all trades (which allows him to add half his proficience to rolls of untrained skills) and Song of Rest (which allows their fellow party members to recover an extra 1d6 of their HP). So, next time someone in the party fails a roll with a skill, I can prompt the bard to roll and narrate how he remembers something that character said before about that same subject, to show how his character has learn from his companions and is now more versed in different things. I can give him that bonus for the roll (or plain declare a success without the roll) and tell him now to write down this new class feature on his character sheet.<br/><br/>For the Song of Rest, I can narrate on the next rest how he finds himself inspired and plays his drums with an upbeat that suddenly has the party either humming the song, clapping their hands and later singing al laughing with him. I tell everyone to add 1d6 of hit dice and tell the player to add this new class feature to his character sheet.<br/><br/>So, from what I see, leveling up doesn't have to be procedural, but it can be accomplished through the narrative instead. I admit it's quite a bit more of work but it may certainly be worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443252/#Comment_443252" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T19:42:35+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  7:42PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds great, but it's still going to drive you insane trying to keep track of 3-5 player's features and signpost them all equally.

Once each session, choose to...<br/>o - Play a restful tune during downtime (1d6 HP etc etc), or...<br/>o - Dabble at an untrained skill with happy results (half proficiency etc etc)<br/>Once a feature is chosen you retain that ability and add a new feature to the list."</i><br/><br/>Would this work for you?

So, maybe when I'm ready to develop the Song of Rest ability, you slip a card to Lisa which directs her to find an opportunity to hand me the card (which, in  turn, describes the new ability you've developed).<br/><br/>It would require you to make a card per player for every session, but that's not THAT much work.<br/><br/>Bonus points if it's interactive, like this:<br/><br/>[you get a card which says:]\n<blockquote><br/>At any appropriate time, tell the player of the Bard that you'd love to hear one of his historical romance songs. If he agrees, and sings the song for you, you recover 1d6 hit dice.<br/><br/>Hand him the "Song of Rest" card. He now has this ability going forward.<br/></blockquote>\nCould use it to develop further relationships between the characters. (This particular envisioning puts a lot of that on the GM; you have to judge whether that's right for your game, or if you want more of the agency in the hands of the players, in which case you'd make your card descriptions much more vague, like Fiasco Tilt elements or something like that.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443262/#Comment_443262" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T21:04:10+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  9:04PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

A few points from it may apply here, but since WotC has once again exceeded its own incompetence for website functionality, I'll have to wing it from memory.<br/><br/>Pre-3rd D&amp;D was essentially a class based rpg with the mechanical fulcrum on attributes. Games of this type are frequently a symbolic or aggregate simulation. Just as hit points are an aggregate representing physical health, exertion/exhaustion, combat skill, etc so classes are a stereotypical amalgam of various narrative character tropes. By choosing a class you're granted an array of abilities (with a few of them improving over time as a part of the overall leveling process). Within such a paradigm levels (reflected by experience points) are an aggregate of age, experience, training, epiphany, and so on. They're not intended to ever be specific or directly representative. That's why attack rolls aren't 'an attack', but instead an overall measure of the outcome of a full minute of exchanges between involved people. <br/><br/>Contrast this with a mostly skill based game. In these types of games things aren't broad generalizations, but are instead a specific one-to-one charting. One skill means one thing, and one roll for that skill represents pretty much one specific action or task. What's more, characters generally improve only specifically in one skill or statistic, and often only by utilizing that particular facet in a predetermined way. Star Trek is an example of this kind of game (especially when using some of the optional character improvement evolutions that are floating around).<br/><br/>Then there are hybrid games that fall somewhere between along an axis. 3rd edition D&amp;D is towards one end, as a mostly class based game that shifted the fulcrum from attributes to skills (mostly). The action was narrowed to have one roll represent one action (sort of), and leveling now meant improvement in only a few skills and most abilities. Compare that to a game on the other side like Shadowrun 1-3 editions, where it's mostly a skill based game with just a couple class flags denoting access to certain sets of skills which improve individually through specific investment of karma (representing both improvement ala experience, and also some narrative impact features such as the karma pool, hand of god, etc).<br/><br/>My point here is that people need to not conflate the core CHARACTER mechanic with the core game mechanics nor the core narrative style.<br/><br/>You talk about the leveling of specific character traits (which shifts the character type from more class based to more skill/ability based), but also the option of abandoning experience (a core game mechanic shift from symbolic to literal), and various methods of explaining the gains (a function of core narrative style). <br/><br/>You can have an experience system in a class game (AD&amp;D), or in a mostly skill game (Shadowrun). Or you can abandon it in either and instead go with a push-button system (i.e. DM or group just determines the when of improvement). It's a mechanic separate from the rest. <br/><br/>You can also have narrative requirements in an aggregate environment (AD&amp;D when using training rules options) or a discrete environment (more like Mouse Guard). It too is a feature separate from the rest.<br/><br/>There's a near infinite variety of combinations, but I think it's important to always keep the integration of character mechanics in the broader game. A game with mechanics toward one end or the other should use character systems that reflect that position on the axis. Narrative style is a whole nother beast, and one which can be applied independent of the mechanical axis, but may impact the overall game style one direction or another upon it depending on perceptions.<br/><br/>I know when we revised pre-3rd D&amp;D for ourselves it was tempting to shift the game toward the same direction you're positing. For that reason we included options at both ends of the hybrid scale. What we found when we played it though was that we chose early edition D&amp;D specifically for it's simple, symbolic/aggregate nature (because it best fit with other mechanics like combat and focus on being class based) and almost invariably returned to the system most like it, unlike when we play 3.5 where we're coming to want to shift it even further towards the literal/discrete end.<br/><br/>If it helps at all one of the compromises we made was breaking the game down into 6 tiers of 6 levels each. In each tier each of these character aspects (hps, combat mechanics, attributes, proficiencies) improves one time, while the class abilities character aspect improves twice, but the choice of order is optionally left up to the character. Think of it like turning each D&amp;D level into 6 levels, where you only improve one thing each of 6 levels instead of 6 things every one level. This makes each level gain reward more focused, and allows finer control over the awarding of experience towards a specific goal, while also clearly differentiating the various tiers as phases in character development and world interaction. <br/><br/>You could probably achieve similar with far less work on your end by finding out how many things improve with a level up and dividing the required experience for the level by that number, then requiring narrative focus on each aspect. So if level 2 requires 1000 experience, and a character gains hit dice, bab, skill points, a feat, an attribute increase, saves increase, and two character abilities (8 things), just let characters earn one of those every 125xp after providing a narrative justification. If you're not on board with experience at all you can fiat the gains as inclusive within the narrative (though again, such a decision could also be suggesting a poor match of core game concepts to players).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443313/#Comment_443313" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T13:20:26+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  1:20PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks phoenix 182, that's more or less what I'm applying now. I'm still staying away from xp and I'll probably use the push the button option mainly because all players are new to 5e and only 3 out of 7 players are familiar with D&amp;D at all. For the more experienced players, I'll consider their choices on what to level up first from the 4/6 things each one gets (the monk is getting the most so far)<br/><br/>Some choices are easier to accomodate to the fiction right now. For example, on the last encounter, the monk and one of the rogues went down to 0 hp. They both made it, the monk by himself and the rogue with some help. They are at full hp now but chosed to stay behind while other two members of the party went scouting. For the next session it makes a lot of sense to me to narrate "you both talk about the last encounter; the monk realizes how to apply better a few teachings of his master about taking hits, learns a couple of things from the gnome rogue and in exchange, the monk points at him what his weakest points are and how to better protect them in a fight. Both learn how to suck more damage, so roll your hit dice, add your Con and add the total to your current HP."<br/><br/>I'm hoping this would give them back some sense of security, in case they lost it a bit at the last encounter (I'm not sure if it's the case, but it will be good to prevent it) If the players choose to share their newfound knowledge (as I'm pretty sure they will do), I can let everyone in the party roll their HP, but it makes sense to me that they will be the first because of what they've been through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443318/#Comment_443318" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T13:40:12+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  1:40PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a bit of an aside, but don't make people roll their HD's in 5E.

Am I doing it wrong? that's what I understood when I readed the rules), not like when you rest and you have the choice of rolling the hit dice or not to regain lost hit points, I leave that up to their choice as RAW.\n<blockquote>I respect you helping new players out but can you really invent and track all of these character advancements with a bit of colour and not leave anyone out?

I mostly though of it this way because as far as I know the players, they are still a bit shy and though I already discussed with them a bit about this way of leveling up and everyone has agreed, the right way to do it is still a bit unclear (which is why I started this discussion) <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks a lot to everyone so far, it may look I'm still a bit reticent about accepting some ideas but I'm actually still considering things and may change my mind completely at the end. At least right now I feel confident I can pull this out my way, but I'll have to wait until next session for a short experiment to be sure, maybe then I'll try another approach or drop the subject completely. Any further viewpoints and ideas are still welcome!<br/><br/>Edit: also, I'm again making another heartbreaker of my own to suit the audience tastes here in my country, and I'd really like to have a different leveling up mechanic. A long time ago I ran a game where I kept throwing at players chances to gain different skills and it was up to them to choose which one to take and roleplay the training to get them used to new mechanics and see if they could attain even a better level in those skills or some otrher trick to further specialize in it. We all loved this approach to leveling up and I certainly would have used it if it didn't totally break D&amp;D, but I'm certain I'll try to apply it to my new game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443365/#Comment_443365" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T17:51:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  5:51PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>As a new roleplayer I would have been a little irked by the dungeon master telling me how my Monk interacts with the Gnome - I would want credit for the idea! </blockquote>\nMy reaction to that example you posted was the same: "Yuck!"<br/><br/>It doesn't sound like fun to me to just have the GM narrate some stuff about my character when he feels like it, and use that to justify my character gaining abilities.

Going from a +2 bonus to a +3 bonus or getting more hit points is nice, but it's not exactly thrilling -- it's just the same stuff you already had, only incrementally better. Getting a new feat or a new spell or some other ability that expands your options, <i>that</i> can be thrilling, and is really what makes you feel like your character has gained something.<br/><br/>Ideally, I'd think you'd want the option-expanding abilities to arrive at a comfortable pace. Often enough to keep things feeling fresh, slow enough to give people the chance to dig in and explore their shiny new powers. And I'm positive you'd want to put any in-game emphasis on those new things, rather than the ho-hum stuff like higher bonuses on things they could already do. (Because even if you feel like you just have to further subdivide levels and hand out bits and pieces of them over four or five sessions instead of giving them all at once, there's still not much to say about getting 5% more likely to succeed at your Reflex Save.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443563/#Comment_443563" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T19:44:30+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  7:44PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly.

It might sounds good on paper but it can come out hard to go through with in reality. It depends on what D&amp;D system you mean.<br/><br/>The biggest issue I had was how to increase skills, because in pre-D&amp;D4 you paid for it, but did that inbetween sessions. What I realized now is that the player can get points before each session to spend on feats, skills or whatnot, but only when they need it during the session. So if a player wants to increase Hide, that person can only do that if the character comes in a situations where s/he must hide. The same goes with feats.<br/><br/>It's possible that you must have different kinds of points for different things.

I'm using fifth edition of D&amp;D, though by now Im getting more and more apart from rules as written.<br/>In the last session a couple of players went murderhobo on a lone adventure (is was just the two of them, another one came late to the rescue, but the rest of the group couldn't make it) so now I'm sure I made the right move by not using alignments nor XP.<br/><br/>Looks like at least these two players are more interested in roleplaying the fantasy of power than in tactics, roll playing, or narrative character development. Not that they aren't interested at all, just that it's secondary, so I'm trying to give them more of what they want by making the game more like Grand Theft Auto, meaning they will be able to go murderhobo with a bit more impunity, instead of ruining the game by forcing morals or karma on the narration. (I went that way on the last session and I still feel like I ruined the game a bit going that way. If they want to play outlaws, I shouldn't be messing with their fun)<br/><br/>I told the players about the pre-made builds, there's a chance the more experienced players would go for it. So far our way of leveling everyone a bit on different things depending on the circumstances has worked quite well. Four PCs who had been left unconscious on the previous battles have just learned a bit more about on how to use their armour better, roll with the impact of the attacks and suck damage more efficiently (a.k.a. rolled their Hit dice and raised their HP; also, the paladin gained +1 to AC) The bard seen the rest of the party down after being defeated in the last battle played them a song to raise their spirits and it worked wonders (a.k.a learned the song of rest) and the monk, whose player asked to roleplay as he was trying and discovering his ki has gained his Ki pool, though he still doesn't know too well how to use it. <br/><br/>So far, players are happy with this, and one of the murderhobos from the other session seems to have less reasons to kill everything on sight, so he's just collecting teeth and ears from his enemies. I think it's going to work just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
