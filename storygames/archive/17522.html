Long story short, I did some brainstorming, and came up with the following concepts.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHARACTERS</span></b><br/>Characters don\u2019t have lists of attributes or skills; instead, the core traits of every character are their <b>Motivations</b>: I have a list of 13 broad, open to interpretation reasons players will use to justify whatever course of action they would follow (Assist, Confront, Control, Defend, Fulfil, Gain Trust, Hurt, Know, Resist, Sabotage, Self-Gratification, Survive, Take Advantage), and those range from rank 1 (latent) to 4 (dominant). More than one motivation will fit an action description, depending on how the player puts it, and that's ok. Motivations are the base of any dice pool (in d6), but characters might get more dice from other sources: <br/><br/>- <b>Pools </b>\u2013 Action (representing effort; energy), Concentration (representing alertness; patience), Stability (resistance to Stress), Tolerance (resistance to Pain). These range from 1 to 6, each point invested is +1d to roll.<br/>- <b>Highlights </b>\u2013 short, descriptive chunks of a character\u2019s identity (pretty much like Aspects from FATE or Disntinctions from Cortex+). Whenever appropriate, a Highlight provides +1d to roll. Starting characters get 3 Highlights.<br/>- <b>Principles </b>\u2013 personal codes. Whenever appropriate, a Principle provides +1d to roll. Starting characters get 3 Principles, each connected to a Motivation.<br/><br/>All characters also have two poles: <b>Humanity </b>and <b>Alienation</b>, which always total 10 (Humanity starts at 10). During character creation, players are interviwed about their characters background concerning violence, traumas, and any other act that could have made them colder. Every event agreed to be dramatic enough moves one point from Humanity to Alienation. When Alienation and Humanity have the same weight (5-5), the character starts to degenerate: the other players will pick one of that character\u2019s Principles and twist it. With time, as characters go further down the Alienation road, they\u2019ll become just a shadow of who they once were.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RULES</span></b><br/>Firstly, we don\u2019t use the terms <i>success </i>or <i>failure</i>; instead, we go with <b>favorable </b>or <b>unfavorable </b>outcome. A lot about this game is having players being on the same page, so we\u2019ll have guidelines, not ground rules. Roll a few dice, check the outcome, and narrate it accordingly. <br/><br/>Players roll dice (dice pools will usually be around 3 to 5 dice), and look for <i>straights</i>: if you rolled any straights (even two-number straights will do), that\u2019s favorable; otherwise, that\u2019s unfavorable. The bigger the straight, the stronger the impact. As I\u2019ve always liked how action scenes are built up with details in WuShu, and how you spend dice at the endgame of Fiasco to narrate actions. So, in my game action scenes, especially in combats, action order goes from highest dice in a straight  downwards: a player gets his highest die and narrate an action, and then use additional dice to build a sequence. If the opposition has any dice with the same result, those actions happen simultaneously.<br/><br/>To spice things up, the GM can use <b>Tension Dice</b>. This pool starts as big as the number of PCs. Depending on the story stage (introduction, escalation, climax, etc), the GM may spend these Dice to complicate characters\u2019 lives: the number displayed on the TD removes a die showing that same number from each character result. This will most likely break players straights, sometimes even changing a favorable outcome into an unfavorable one. The good news is, once spent, these dice are gone.<br/><br/>As a variation of Tension Dice, we have the <b>Pain </b>and <b>Stress </b>dice: Pain is the most typical consequence of physical contests, Stress is a consequence of emotional and mental distress. They work as TD, but they\u2019re not gone once spent (they need to be eliminated). Characters start getting Pain/Stress Dice when their Tolerance/Stability reserves are zeroed.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HELP</span></b><br/>Considering you\u2019re still reading, this is what I need help with:<br/><br/>- <b><i>Multiple Straights</i></b>: considering that I\u2019m accepting even two-number straights as positive, what other use can I give to extra straights, save for the obvious multiple actions option?<br/>- <b><i>Matches</i></b>: I\u2019m thinking matches could intensify a result: if the result is favorable, it gets even more impressive (maybe recover from Pain or Stress?); if it\u2019s unfavorable, it gets worse (and contributes to the Tension Pool). However, I\u2019d like some options, just in case.<br/>- <b><i>How to recharge Reserves</i></b>: I forgot to mention, but points from a Reserve are bid \u2013 if the outcome is positive, you keep them; otherwise they\u2019re gone.<br/>- <b><i>How to recover from Pain / Stress</i></b>: so far, I\u2019d allow characters a recovery roll at the end of the day, given that they\u2019ve taken providence.<br/><br/>So, how does it look so far?  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397311/#Comment_397311" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T07:58:29+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  7:58AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Characters could exploit their dominant motivations, whereas their latent motivations could be tagged and used by others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397322/#Comment_397322" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T08:31:43+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  8:31AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to know what kind of feeling, atmosphere or stories you want the players to create with the game, that would help a lot to give you proper responses.

The more alienated, the closer to lose control over character choices, as the character becomes a hostage of their own whims. <br/><br/>Regarding players control, I'd say they'll have as much control as it's convenient to the group. If things start going too off, the group can always vote and veto whatever feels wrong.\n<blockquote>As far as I can think about it, I'd recommend that each roll should only use a maximun of 2 motivations, but only because it could take too much time for the player to think how many additional motivations she can fit in the current situation.

Dice pools would consist of a Motivation + appropriate Highlights + appropriate Principle + dice from a Reserve. As long as the GM is comfortable with the terms of play, it shouldn't be hard to help a player decide on a Motivation.<br/><br/>GM: "Ok, he's sitting right there, by the dark corner of the pub. He's the one. He killed your partner and got away with that. Now he's having fun. He sees you and raises his glass towards you. With a grin, he takes his shot and flips the empty glass on the table. What you're going to do?"<br/><br/>Player: "I'm finishing my drink, my dose of liquid courage. I see his alone, and at this time there aren't many people around. I'll walk towards him, an open penkife palmed. I want to puncture the side of his neck."<br/><br/>GM: "Mmm, I see. Whay are you doing it? It's plain to see you're angered, but what exactly is guiding yor hand?"<br/><br/>Player: "I'd say is Hurt, isn't it obvious? Or maybe Confront?"<br/><br/>GM: "Too obvious, actually. Are you sure you're not doing that because you think it's your responsibility? Both as a cop and as a friend?"<br/><br/>Player: "Yes! That's it!

Alex's team had arrested Ral's goons, but he managed to escape moments earlier. Now, finding himself at a dead end, Ral is taking desperate measures.<br/><br/>Dario, playing Alex, decides that his intention is to overpower Ral and take him into custody, but if he happens to get some bruises in the process, the better. His action is driven by his strong sense of duty (Fulfil 3d), to which Dario adds the "Police Hero" Highlight (+1d) and the "For each crime, a punishment" Principle (+1d). The player decides not to spend dice from Alex's Reserves, so he'll be rolling 5d.<br/><br/>Ral has no intentions to surrender, and in a mix of panic and overconfidence, decides to go for it and appeals to violence (Hurt 3d), together with the "Dangerous Criminal" Highlight (+1d) and his "Never go back to jail" Principle (+1d). The GM spends an Action dice from Ral's Reserve (+1d), collecting a total of 6d. <br/><br/>Rolling the dice, Alex gets 1-3-3-5-6 (straight: 5-6), and the GM gets 1-2-3-3-3-5 (straight: 1-2-3). Both have favorable outcomes, which means the round is balanced, but not conclusive, leaning slightly towards Ral (his straight is bigger). Alex's straight allows Dario to describe two moves, whereas the GM can describe three. Action order starts with the highest dice and then goes downwards, so Dario takes his dice showing the '6' and describes Alex leaping towards Ral. The next highest dice (5) is also Alex's, so Dario describes his character punching Ral's face. As none of Rals dice is high enough to allow the GM to describe a block or something, the punch lands, reducing Ral's Tolerance by 2 (once for the favorable outcome, and twice for the matched 3s, which improves the result). Nice punch.<br/><br/>In return, the GM describes Ral's sequence of actions as being: "with the impact, Ral steps backwards a bit (the 3), using the new positioning gap to kick Alex in the leg (the 2), and then punch Alex in the face (the 1). Alex reduces his Tolerance by 2 as well (again, once for the favorable outcome, and twice for the matched 3s). <br/><br/>Let the new round begin.</blockquote>\nHope that helps at least to see how an action round is supposed to run. <br/>If you're thinking about specific circumstances, let me know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397466/#Comment_397466" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T09:06:35+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  9:06AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks more like noir instead of horror to me, since players get to fight things head on instead of dabbling into the unknown and run from it more than fighting it.

That's the kind of outside the box thinking I'm after, thanks. I'll give these suggestions some digesting and let you guys know what turns up.<br/><br/><i>Edit: I really dig the noir tip.
