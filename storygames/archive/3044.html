It's generally the largest <i>discreet </i>unit of play.<br/><br/>The analogy I find useful is to think about basketball or baseball (or any number of other sports). The "reward cycle" in those sports is one game. One game is a clearly defined, independent "arc" of play. It's not an individual play or quarter/inning. Those things build to decide the winner of a single game. Individual games can build into a season, but the idea of a season is an add-on, it's entirely possible to play a single pick-up game. <br/><br/>Regarding RPGs, reward-cycle is somewhat game-specific. However, it is generally "one adventure", whatever that means. I would say, that in general, it takes 1-4 sessions to play through an entire cycle. In DitV, a reward cycle is a town. In tMW, MLwM, Roach, or Polaris, it's the entire game. In Sorcerer, it's the resolution of a Kicker. In PTA... well, in PTA it's debatable whether it's a single episode or an entire season. In DnD, it's generally one "adventure", but that gets confusing if you play a continuous &amp; never-ending campaign.<br/><br/>Did that help?<br/><br/>[edit] <i>Cross posted with Bill. I would add that there's *usually* some sort of mechanical marker, like resolving a Kicker in Sorcerer. But I don't believe that's totally necessary. Leveling-up in DnD, for example, is a bit of an add-on concept. How often you level up will vary on what level of character you're playing and what types of monsters you're fighting. It may take less than one or several "missions" to advance a level.</i> [/edit]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69514/#Comment_69514" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T04:25:48+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  4:25AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2007 4:26AM by Judd.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got the following links by putting the terms, reward cycle into the Forge's search engine:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17489.0" rel="nofollow">Reward Cycle  </a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17508.0" rel="nofollow">Reward Cycle II: Cycle Sans System </a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17801.0" rel="nofollow"> Reward Cycle III: hybrids</a><br/><br/>I got the following link by typing the terms, reward cycle, Forge, into Google:<br/><a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10738063&amp;postID=113521233037393791" rel="nofollow">Rewards on Esoteric Murmurs  </a><br/><br/>Let me know if that is helpful at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69515/#Comment_69515" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T04:28:08+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  4:28AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, just for the record, this is how I'm going to roll for this thread.<br/><br/>I will drop by on occasion, pick a question, do some searching, post here what I did and post the links.<br/><br/>Hope that is helpful.<br/><br/>I don't know shit about GNS, truth be told.

I think it can, or bits of it can, in that some of the components are things you want to make sure you effectively cover in your design, and a casual review might indicate things for you to tighten up.  Some of the individual terms point to design elements worth mulling over and having an answer for.  Like the individual pieces that make up the term Exploration, for example.

It's an analytical tool for diagnosing what is wrong (or right) with your game during the design period.   What the Big Model won't do is say "Here's how to design a game... Step 1: blah blah blah. Step 2: blah blah blah."<br/><br/>I'm a software developer so I'm going to use a programming analogy here. (For other designers out there, I'm not being terribly precise here.  It's just an analogy.  Don't get hung up on it.)  In software design there's a model for design called a 3 Tier Model that divides a program up into layers and shows how those layers ought to interact.  It's very general with lots of nifty jargon that goes along with it.  Does this model actually help me write a program.  Sort of, in the sense that it shows me how my program should generally work.  If I'm having trouble with something during the design I can look at it with respect to the model and say, "Hey, I've got this piece of code in the Presentation Tier when it should be in the Application Tier.  That'll make it work better."  But the model doesn't say, 'Here's how to write a program.  Step 1: blah blah blah.  Step 2: blah blah blah."<br/><br/>The Big Model is like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69627/#Comment_69627" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T09:17:43+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  9:17AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say, first time in, don't try to apply Big Model stuff to your game design till you have something playable.

The Big Model will not provide you with a checklist, a step-by-step procedure, or a method of designing your game.  All that is well beyond the scope of Big Model.  What the Big Model will do for you is to get you thinking about how you want your game to operate: it highlights that there are different things to focus on and different ways to direct that focus.  It will never tell you what to focus on or how you should focus on things.  All of that is up to you, and is why game design is a creative endeavor.<br/><br/>With few exceptions, most games directly inspired by the Big Model turn out crap, or never get past the idle tinkering stage.  The designer reads something and goes, "But hey, what if you did X and Y, then you'd get Z."  It's a interesting and worthwhile exercise, but it's not good design.  Good design is fueled by a passion for the game you want to play, not by what is theoretically possible according to abstract dictates.<br/><br/>My advice to you, which you are free to discard, is to just sit down and design your first draft without thinking about theory too much.  Theory, analysis, and criticism ought to happen between drafts, not during them.  After you've got a first draft "done" then compare it to theory, have other people poke at it with critical analysis, playtest it a bit, and then go back and modify things.

You can use those techniques in pursuit of any of the three creative agendas - that's gamism, narrativism, simulationism - provided that you structure the game appropriately otherwise.<br/><br/>For purposes of example, let's say that you're playing narrativist if and only if you're playing a loyal person whose loyalty is tested.<br/><br/>Can you immersively play this loyal person whose loyalty is tested? Absolutely, and if you do, you've used the techniques of immersion to play narrativist.<br/><br/>For purposes of example, let's say that you're playing simulationist if and only if you're playing a loyal person whose loyalty is celebrated (without ever being put to any real test).<br/><br/>Can you immersively play this loyal person whose loyalty is celebrated? Absolutely, and if you do, you've used the techniques of immersion to play simulationist.<br/><br/>Make sense? Whether immersive play is narrativist or simulationist (or gamist) depends on other things than the immersion itself.</blockquote>\nIn other words, GNS doesn't deal with immersion at all because immersion can exist within any of the three Creative Agendas - it's just not on the same level, so it's a non-issue in the context of GNS.  Under the Big Model, immersion is a large, loosely-associated body of techniques that can be used in support of any Creative Agenda, for the purposes of either focusing strongly on the content of the in-game fiction, or for identifying strongly with your character(s).  There's varying amount of overlap of immersive techniques from one person to the next - what supports some people's sense of immersion may destroy others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69794/#Comment_69794" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T15:06:55+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  3:06PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The party line on Immersion in the Big Model is that immersion is a technique or set of techniques that can be used to many different purposes.  Techniques are actually not at all what Big Model is about, and so it doesn't talk about them much.<br/><br/>The thing about immersion, though, and people who really like it, is that it usually looms very large on their conception of "what roleplaying is."  To lots of folks, immersion <em>is</em> roleplaying, and they have trouble envisioning roleplaying without immersion (or have trouble imagining enjoyable play without it).  This often results in people getting annoyed by the Big Model saying immersion is 'just' a technique, which is reading in a dismissal and disdain that isn't there.<br/><br/>Mo has done some work on immersion at her blog (which I can't easily link to from work -- help, anybody?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69799/#Comment_69799" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T15:12:56+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  3:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2007 3:13PM by Adam_Dray.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Crossposted with the above.</i><br/><br/>Robert,<br/><br/>I don't think anyone fully understands Immersion Play. I don't think most people can agree on what Immersion is. It's one of those troubling terms that perennially causes a lot of argument on Internet forums.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, immersion is a technique, a tool. It's this thing you do when you're role-playing. You sorta temporarily reprogram your mind so that you can "be" someone else for a little while. Players can slip in and out of this immersion mode to talk about the game, roll dice, and other stuff but the general consensus among regular immersive players is that those kinds of interruptions make immersion harder and less enjoyable.<br/><br/>Within the Big Model, immersion is a Technique. Being immersed is Ephemera (stuff that happens moment to moment during play). Simulationism is a Creative Agenda (CA), which is something that touches all aspects of play, including Techniques.<br/><br/>The relationship between GNS (really, Creative Agenda) and Immersion is that <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/bigmodelpic.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Creative Agenda is a "skewer" that pierces down through the layers of the Big Model</a> (those layers being Social Contract, Exploration, and Techniques).<br/><br/>I've talked with people who believe Immersion is a Creative Agenda. If this is true, Immersion has to really work through all three of those layers in the same way that Gamism, Narrativism, and Simulationism do, and I haven't really seen a convincing argument one way or another (but that doesn't mean there isn't one out there). Personally, I think it falls flat in the Exploration layer, and I believe Immersion is <i>not</i> its own CA.<br/><br/>I would say that the Big Model relates to immersion just fine, if you define immersion as a Technique. <br/><br/>I believe there's a fair amount of thought and writing out there about immersion. The Forge's <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Provisional Glossary</a> cites John Kim as a <i>q.v.</i>. When you read articles on immersion, be clear on their definition of it, since people use the word in many different ways, some only subtly different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69818/#Comment_69818" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T16:26:05+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  4:26PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question, but I'm having a bit of a hard time phrasing it properly:<br/><br/>What is the outlook on and of GMs in Immersion heavy games?\n<blockquote><cite>Joshua BishopRoby</cite> The thing about immersion, though, and people who really like it, is that it usually looms very large on their conception of "what roleplaying is."

It has helped cleared up my confusion both in terms of GNS as well as immersion.  I was just in \xe2\u20ac\u0153Robin's Laws' player types, GNS, and exclusivity of preferences.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  Between that discussion and the answers provided here have lead me to another stumbling point/question.<br/><br/>While I get why Immersion may be defined as a tool/technique by some/most, for some folks I play with it is a goal.  If I may be so brazen, it is an agenda.  It may not be a Creative Agenda, or a Social Agenda, but it is most certainly an agenda.<br/><br/>(Not really trying to start an old (new to me) debate about Immersion and it place in Big Model)<br/><br/>My question/stumbling point is;<br/><br/>What is a Creative Agenda?  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve read Ron\xe2\u20ac\u2122s essays on GNS, and I understand the three different Agendas and their differences (you know, for the most part, but not really yet).  But why only three?  What makes a Creative Agenda a Creative Agenda?  Is it the way we have fun while playing a RPG?<br/><br/>According to this \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>Nat,<br/><br/>Just for your information, most player classifications schemes (such as Robin's Laws) are known as Skewers in the context of the Big Model. As in, they represent various sets of preferences that "pierce" down through all the layers of the Model, like a system kabob.<br/><br/>We could break them down to something like:<br/><br/><b>Specialist</b><br/>Social Contract: The player won't be ostracized for playing a ninja... AGAIN.<br/>Exploration: The Situation involves a Setting with opportunities for sneaky "ninja" Character to exist. System provides options for doing stereotypically ninja stuff. Color emphasizes how ninja guy is uber-badass.<br/>Techniques: Some mechanics for playing out the various stealthy combat, ninja magic, whatever, stuff would probably be good.<br/>Ephemera: Screen Time must be given to allow the player to shine as "the ninja".<br/><br/>Note how none of those things really maps to GNS. It seems quite likely that our Specialist would enjoy a Simulationist game where he can Explore various facets of being a ninja. However, it's also quite possible he would also enjoy a Gamist game where he throws down with the power of his elite ninja skill suite, or a Narrativist game which lets him tell a story which happens to involve a ninja dude. All of these might satisfy his appetite for ninja, but none of these games would be even remotely the same. And, it's even quite possible he'd enjoy one or two of these and find the other(s) boring, despite being ninja to the max. So crap... this means you could get three ninja Specialist players together, and they might<i>still</i>expect different things from their gaming.<br/><br/>And, as Ben points out, the GNS Creative Agendas describe play types, not player types. So, comparing GNS and Skewers is basically an apples to oranges comparison, but hopefully the above example demonstrates how GNS is more useful than Skewers in defining which shared activity everyone is participating in.<br/><br/>Also, what Ben said about past experiences.<i>This is especially true</i>for Laws' Specialist skewer.<br/><br/>Oh yeah... have you read<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15234.msg163928" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>from April 2005?</blockquote>\nplaying a ninja is a Creative Agenda. (tongue in cheek)  Playing a ninja maybe isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t a Creative Agenda, but it certainly is an Agenda.  How does the Big Model deal with Agendas that are not the big three?  Are there other valid ways to prioritize goals in the framework of the Big Model other than defining them in the framework of GNS.  If a playgroup prioritizes their play based on a different sort of Agenda (we all want to play ninjas, we all will be character to the greatest extent possible) will they have fun?  As much fun?  <br/><br/>I apologize if this post wanders away from the orginal intent of this discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69826/#Comment_69826" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T16:46:00+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  4:46PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob, you mean GMs practicing immersion themselves as they run the badguys and townsfolk and whatnot?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69830/#Comment_69830" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T16:57:01+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  4:57PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Bob, you mean GMs practicing immersion themselves as they run the badguys and townsfolk and whatnot?</blockquote>\nThat's one part of it.

I'm going to tread carefully.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, players can choose any goal they want for a session of roleplaying.  I could decide "My goal here is to roll as many 12-sided dice as possible.  If I roll more d12s than anyone else, I win!"  I can then willfully pursue that over the course of one or more sessions.  Should D12-Rollingism then be a Creative Agenda?  No.  The idea is that an agenda is not <i>just</i> something players want, but also something that interacts with the system, the fiction, and most specifically the game's reward cycle in  particular ways.  Also, as Mike Holmes said in another thread here on SG recently, G, N, and S are only one possible breakdown of CAs - the ones that are most concretely incompatible with each other, and thus most likely to cause problems of incoherence during play.<br/><br/>That having been said, the choice to pursue immersion may actually fit the profile of an agenda - but a Technical Agenda, rather than a Creative one.  Basically, separate from CA, a reward cycle of play is showing a strong dependence on a certain body of techniques, which plays a large part in whether the players enjoy themselves or not.  (Just like Creative Agendas, the player may be aware of his Technical Agenda, or may not.)  Just like immersion-in-general, immersion-as-a-Technical-Agenda can be paired with any of the three Creative Agendas.<br/><br/>Here, check out the diagram of the Big Model as envisioned by Ben:<br/><br/><img alt="Big Model as Drawn by Ben Lehman" src="http://adam.legendary.org/images/8/8d/BenBigModel.gif"/><br/><br/>The Technical Agenda happens simultaneously to but separately from the Creative and Social Agendas.  Note that I'm not 100% sure that immersion could be considered a full-fledged Technical Agenda - it just seems like it could, to my understanding.  Ben Lehman (and doubtless some others) can probably say yea or nay with more authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69850/#Comment_69850" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T18:01:39+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  6:01PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Addressing komradebob's issues of immersionism and GMs:<br/><br/>I think most immersionist players who also GM content themselves mostly with the type of immersion that is "focusing strongly on the contents of the in-game fiction," while settling for vibrant moments of the "identifying strongly with your character(s)" type.  A lot of GMs don't mind this at all, but some find themselves subordinating their own fun to that of their players - I think that's a sentiment you've probably seen online before.  It might be ideal to pair a single player who doesn't really care about immersion with a group consisting of strong immersionists, so that she or he can handle the GM duties and get her or his own type of fun while the other players pursue their immersion.<br/><br/>The reason why more immersionist players don't play without a GM seems rather self-evident: because they don't want to handle the tasks that are considered the GM's responsibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69853/#Comment_69853" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T18:08:11+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  6:08PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously, if you're interested in immersionists, you should talk to immersionists.  <br/><br/>I'm not what I would call a hard-core immersionist, but I've probably gone further in that direction than many people here.

If so, doesn't that create some weirdness in that GMs are then not roleplaying?</blockquote>\nFrom a character-immersion viewpoint (which might or might apply to immersion at large), a two-part answer:<br/><br/>1) When GMing character-immersion larp, the GM's duty is to make himself as unnecessary as possible during the actual play. As the playing enviroment supports itself, in terms of setting (it exists in physical sense), characters (with the possible exclusion of NPC's) and hopefully rules, the GM doesen't need to take an active part in the game. His role is one of organiser and writer.<br/><br/>2) When GMing a charater-immersion tabletop game, the playing enviroment usually does not support itself in terms of setting (it's imagined and has to be constantly updated), characters (only player characters are represented by players) and possibly rules (the physics cannot be governed by doing things but might need some kind of resolution mechanics). The GM's role is to potray the the fiction outside the characters and make it respond to what characters do. The GM could be considered to be a supporting player who takes care of things that other players want to only to interact with through the fiction. Regarding the LARP side, GM fills in the things that the play enviroment lacks in tabletop playing. He can do a lot more, if he so wishes, but that's the basic responsibility.<br/><br/>As for dropping the GM; it's entirely possible, if the fiction does not need to be updated outside the context of characters. It's a bit of a hazy line between what players are able and willing to do (they can, for example, say that they walk to a phone booth nearby, and install the mentioned phone booth to fiction for the first time, but are not able to say that suddenly, a group of ninjas enter the room where characters are).<br/><br/>As for GM-immersion; I, personally, do character-immersion very rarely when GMing. It's a different kind of job, a supporting role and that of an audience in times when active participation is not needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M" title="Robert M"><img alt="Robert M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M">Robert M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70152/#Comment_70152" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T08:18:53+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  8:18AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New question.<br/><br/>What games best support Simulationist play?
