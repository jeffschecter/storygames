The checkmate is a very weird instance of the chess rules. Checkmate is not like anything else in chess. RPGs have a lot of segments that are different too. D&amp;D3's combat system is not integrated into the rest of the system, you can learn the skill system and how to make decisions for your character and still (Edit:) not know how to do combat. (Where did the end of that sentence go?)<br><br>Secondly, some comics are easier to read than others.  Archie comics are friggin' designed by computer to be mega-easy to read.<br><br>Third, it is not a mistake to make a RPG that you need to develop skill in to play successfully.  The dismissal of "good GMing" in things like the original System Matters essay is a good (enormously wrongheaded) example. GMing D&amp;D is a lot of fun to learn how to do, even if you may not be perfect in every way after you finish reading the rulebook. It's a rewarding skill to develop, just like chess or playing a musical instrument.  It is not a mistake to develop a game that requires you to speak in character!  It is not a mistake to develop a game that requires you to be creative!  Yes, such a game will be a failure for people who don't like those things, or can't do them but so what?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325679/#Comment_325679" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T12:15:46+00:00" title="May 22, 2011 12:15PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I jump back to comics first?<br/>Were these marvel comic books?<br/>If so, I might agree!<br/>There's a bunch of comic books that are harder to read, and some that are quite easy(Watchmen).<br/>I think the words "most" and "average" are needfully troublesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325685/#Comment_325685" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T12:38:56+00:00" title="May 22, 2011 12:38PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I frequently misread Ultimate spider-man graphic novels, going down when i'm supposed to jump across to the next page ...

This is why I brought up the Chess example. If you take away the strategy that can only be obtained by practice and experience, Chess becomes a much weaker game. It's no longer Chess. Practice and experience are not bad things to require. It really just depends on your goals. Good or bad is relative to context. <br/><br/>But that is also not the topic in hand (which is why I excluded practice and used the Chess example to begin with). You can help improve modern Marvel comics readability in ways that don't take away from the enjoyment they provide or make them not feel like Marvel comics. <br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>GMing D&amp;D is a lot of fun to learn how to do, even if you may not be perfect in every way after you finish reading the rulebook.

This can be said of almost all things. It is not a mistake to develop a game in any specific way. It just depends on your goals.<br/><br/>If I want to write a game for my dad that he can play soon after reading the rules, and I write it in English... I failed because his ability to read English is limited. Which doesn't mean someone else can't enjoy my game or that I didn't get something out of the experience (I learn a lot from making mistakes) but it would be a failure and mistake in the context of my goals. I don't know D&amp;D's goal (except partially for 4E) so I can't say if they made a mistake in their design.

Shadowrun 3 being an example I have experience with. I knew so many people who claimed that they knew all the rules, had great memories, and bragged about it... and still used the rules incorrectly. But we've been able to play Shadowrun, possibly poorly, even when we got a few of the rules wrong because they were hard to remember or reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325758/#Comment_325758" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T21:19:10+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  9:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>the sheer number of rules in some games.</blockquote>\nI would point to the presentation,  I'm fairly sure TCGs are more complicated then RPGs and have more rules. However TCGs do a much better job of presenting these rules. The function of cards is that each rule can be learned and understood as the card is introduced to the player. Once learned the art on the card becomes an icon that easily recalls the rules of the card to your mind. This relationship allows players to remember years of card sets. RPGs however try to float these rules on nothing but text.<br/><br/>If someone looks at a comic book and cant parse out the story, i think thats similar to someone looking at an RPG book and not understanding how it could ever be a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325760/#Comment_325760" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T21:30:16+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  9:30PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like barriers to entry inherent to the medium?

Then I might clamber all over your material to understand it and really bang my head against the barriers until I get through them.

It's been ages since I read that essay. 2. I always take stuff Ron said and interpret it the way I like and I don't care much for What He Really Meant.)<br/>I don't think he ever dismisses "good GMing", that would be silly. He dismisses the common phrase "Bob is a great GM, he can even make FATAL fun!" which implies that a) Bob's great GMing techniques saving the game aren't system b) that all games are the same and rules don't matter because hey, we've got Bob. Etc. etc. But whatever.<br/><br/>In the context of this thread I'd say that one thing that people commonly can't do is communicate and set expectations properly. Which is a people problem, not a RPG problem. (Is not knowing how to read comics a problem of functional literacy or a comics problem?)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>When you think about other manuals in daily life, cook books, car repair, all of these are step by step</blockquote>\nProbably worth pointing out, for the sake of the example, that most people who know how to cook practically never look at cookbooks. Maybe just to find a new recipe or refresh your memory a bit, but it's all tacit knowledge, improvisation and application of acquired skill, taste, sense, not step-by-step following of instructions.<br/><br/>Like with AW Fronts. They have a pretty rigid procedure and instructions about how to set them up but what they really are is a guideline for organizing your inspirational material to help you make shit up during the game. Same with the Principles and Moves. You're not supposed to go down the list at the table, you're supposed to internalize it and then wing it.<br/><br/>-<br/>Compared to comics I don't think there's one general thing that people fail to do at RPGs (except maybe the communication thing above), because RPGs are too diverse and <i>interactive</i>. I do think however that most RPG books are terrible at explaining the game because they do it from an insider position, with tons of baggage and blind assumptions and then go on preaching about "what is roleplaying" to "outsiders" or "begginers" and often just make a mess of it.<br/><br/>I've seen complete newbs try roleplaying and absolutely shine at it, because it's actually an extremely natural activity. You just have to present it right, instead of making it esoteric and strange and underground - a sin that is on the side of gamers themselves (ourselves). <br/><br/>So I'd like to reverse the position: <i>Anyone</i> can roleplay. They might not find it fun or a worthwhile investment of their time and energy, but they can. It's us gamers who made roleplaying full of "doing it wrong" and "you can't".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325832/#Comment_325832" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T09:09:20+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  9:09AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of reading comics, one of the other graduate students in my department studies how the brain processes sequential images.
