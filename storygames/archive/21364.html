I know that 5E is not the best fit for a GoT campaign but that\u2019s the game the players would like to use. I\u2019m very unfamiliar with the more crunchy mainstream games and it seems that 5E has a lot of moving parts to balance. I\u2019m going to be redesigning a lot of the game in due time to better fit the campaign and its goals. I think I will need some help with redesigning classes to fit the game. I know that it would be easier to keep the classes as is but it just won\u2019t work with our aims.<br/><br/>Are there some good resources when it comes to designing classes, pretty much from the ground up? How to keep classes balanced and just a very detailed resources about designing classes overall? Any resources you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

I ask because they're so similar, and there's a lot more ready-made material available for the 3rd edition, probably including something directly applicable to Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>In fact, what am I even babbling about - there is a Game of Thrones d20 rpg, isn't there? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">Indeed, the ever-indomitable Guardians of Order published one in 2005.</a> Just use that. <i>At the very least</i> get that book and convert it to 5th edition, I imagine you'll save yourself something like 50 hours of work - and that's assuming you're up to doing a major hack on a complex game like this in the first place.<br/><br/>Of course whether that makes any sense depends on how similar your setting is to Game of Thrones in the first place. Well, something to think about at least.<br/><br/>I haven't done it for 5th edition, but I've rewritten the classes for old school D&amp;D, 3rd edition and 4th edition myself in my time. It's a considerable amount of work and requires quite a bit of system mastery and sheer GM confidence. I would only recommend it for a pretty serious campaign - as in, you're confident that it'll be played long-term, and has a good chance to achieve artistic satisfaction.<br/><br/>I'm not aware of any resources for 5th edition hacking in particular except to ask people with expertise to help out on the more difficult bits. The general approach would be to study the game's system as a whole and, once you understand what the classes do and what they can do, you write your own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467586/#Comment_467586" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-09T21:56:49+00:00" title="November  9, 2017  9:56PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2017 9:57PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eero, <br/>I just bought the D20 book based on your suggestion.

I mean, I made a young Robert Baratheon like character, except that it was a bastard with enough etiquette to excuse himself out of troubles and avoided social combat at any cost. That gave me enough points to make him a monster on the battlefield by using a hammer to crunch armored oponents, even if I had to take some damage before being able to land one hit. However one hit was usually enough to finish anything, unless I got too unlucky.<br/><br/>Other two members of the party were minmaxed archers, able to make trick shots and sniping from afar, so we ended up being able to wipe opposition consistently, in a game where combat is otherwise lethal and should only be used as a last resort and when in advantage.<br/><br/>Since we used the books present timeline, I got to fight both Jaime and the dog in "practice" combat and more or less one-shot them both after taking a moderate chunk of damage; won the melee combat tournament at King's Landing and our group managed to rescue both Samsa and Arya from there. We were this close from rescuing Ned too, but at least managed to take one eye from Cersei (DM used a plot point to keep her alive, the damage was too high for her to survive normally)<br/><br/>Never managed to totally get the core rules though, the DM was good with the numbers and rules so he handled that part for us. Yet the class ideas in the book and the chapter for creating and managing houses were amazingly fun, we all made up our own houses and made them fit into the setting seamlessly. They weren't major houses but became important enough to play roles in our story.<br/><br/>If anything, I'd have like to had more intrigue, but you could only make characters good enough for one thing or mediocre in two, so perhaps tweaking D&amp;D will make things a bit better. Best luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467608/#Comment_467608" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-11T13:59:46+00:00" title="November 11, 2017  1:59PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a cleaned up version. I am basically stealing it from our Empire of the Petal Throne game. <br/><br/>Fire and Ice Character Creation<br/><br/>Step 1. BACKGROUND<br/>Pick a background your character is from. Each background contains your general Personality trait, starting Languages, piece of equipment from your homeland, and what houses and classes you can take. <br/><br/><b>BACKGROUNDS</b><br/><br/><b>DORNE</b><br/>Personality trait\xa0<br/>The Dornish are a fierce people with skin burned dark by the sun, who live in the cities and towns of the southron deserts. Rhoynish blood still flows strong in this region, the most removed of the Seven Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Skill Proficiencies:\xa0Survival, Animal Handling <br/>Languages:\xa0Common Tongue and Rhoynar (10% chance)<br/>Equipment from homeland: \xa0<br/><br/>Class exits: Artisan, Hunter, Man-at-arms, Noble, Raider<br/>House exits: Baratheon<br/><br/><b>THE IRON ISLANDS</b><br/>Personality trait<br/>The Ironmen ply the ocean on swift longships, raiding and pillaging in the name of their Drowned God. Their only true occupation is war.<br/><br/>Skill Proficiencies:\xa0Intimidation, Survival (Ocean)<br/>Languages:\xa0Common Tongue<br/>Equipment from homeland:<br/><br/>Class exits: Hunter, Man-at-arms, Knave, Raider<br/>House exits: Greyjoy, Stark, Baratheon<br/><br/><b>KING\u2019S LANDING</b>\xa0<br/>Personality trait<br/>The site of Aegon the Conqueror\u2019s landing and the royal throne of the Seven Kingdoms, this is one of the world\u2019s most bustling cities. The people of King\u2019s Landing are savvy, jaded, and ambitious \u2014 in other words, born rulers.<br/><br/>Skill Proficiencies:\xa0Perception, Deception <br/>Languages:\xa0Common Tongue<br/>Equipment from homeland:<br/><br/>Class exits: All except for Godsworn, Hunter, and Raider<br/>House exits: Any<br/><br/><b>THE CITADEL</b><br/>Personality trait:<br/>Founded many centuries ago to promote and increase learning and knowledge in Westeros. <br/><br/>Skill Proficiencies:\xa0Medicine, History<br/>Languages:\xa0Common Tongue<br/>Equipment from homeland:<br/><br/>Class exits: Maester<br/>House exits: Any<br/><br/>Step 2. HOUSES AND FACTIONS<br/>Pick the house or faction that you serve. The Houses Ideal becomes your characters\u2019 Ideal. You also inherit the Social Status Rank (pg 90-92 AGOTRB) from your house. These is used for political negations and how much wealth you have access to.  <br/><br/><b>HOUSES AND FACTIONS</b><br/><br/><b>ARRYN</b><br/>Faction outlook: One of the oldest and purest lines of Andal blood in Westeros, they rule the Vale of Arryn.<br/><br/>Ideal: As High As Honour.\xa0<br/><br/>Allied Houses: Stark, Tully<br/>Enemy Houses: Lannister<br/>Social Status: Rank 4<br/><br/><b>BARATHEON</b><br/>Faction outlook: The youngest of the great houses, who took the Iron Throne by breaking the Targaryen dynasty.<br/><br/>Ideal: Ours Is the Fury.<br/><br/>Allied Houses: Lannister, Stark<br/>Enemy Houses: Targaryen<br/>Social Status: Rank 5<br/><br/><b>STARK</b>\xa0<br/>Faction outlook: Once the Kings in the North, they still remember the old gods and the ways of the First Men<br/><br/>Ideal: Winter Is Coming.\xa0<br/><br/>Allied Houses: Baratheon, Tully<br/>Enemy Houses: Greyjoy, Lannister<br/>Social Status: 4<br/><br/><b>THE CITADEL</b><br/>Faction outlook:  Record and preserve all matters scientific, medical, and historical.<br/><br/>Ideal: Knowledge is true power.<br/><br/>Allied Houses: None<br/>Enemy Houses: None<br/>Social Status: 2<br/><br/>Step 4. FLAWS AND BONDS<br/>You will write down two Bonds. One Bond is to another player\u2019s character and one is to the House you currently serve. You will also create one Flaw based on your House\u2019s Personality (pg. 74 - 89 AGOTRB)<br/><br/>Step 5. CLASS<br/>Choose you class. Your class is how you as a player want to approach problem solving in <br/>Westeros. <br/><br/>Step 6.
