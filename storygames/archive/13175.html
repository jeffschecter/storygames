I would have spent $650-$700 of the money on InDesign, because I feel that what I can do with my old layout software (Pagemaker) to make my games graphically grabby is increasingly overshadowed by what folks like John Harper, Gregor Hutton, Luke Crane, and Daniel Solis are doing with current software. But I held off for this exact reason: the game I would have pitched will be done whether I were to get the award or not. And I'd like to think the award will make more of a difference than that for some other designer.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297262/#Comment_297262" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T13:45:43+00:00" title="October 18, 2010  1:45PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, that's a really thorny issue.

It certainly made me reread my own pitch in a new light, not as a new approach to an existing genre like it is in my head but as another fanboy stuck in a genre.

I did all that five years (and more) ago and got as far as one can with thought experiments and spreadsheet math. And that's where the similarity of tabletop design and LARP design ends.<br/><br/>For "initial playtesting," I've had small get-togethers where very experienced LARPers played with the various components and tried short battles with some Abilities; and those meetings resulted in new rules or tighter rules. That's all well and good; but it's also like saying one's "tested Magic; The Gathering" by pitting a couple of decks against each other. In actuality, there's a VAST gulf between those sorts of thought experiments/quick testing and full "regression testing" with scores of folks all pushing at their own agendas and trying to maximize the system (or best-model their character concept with the system elements). Even tapping local resources and friends, I can't hope to fully test GLASS's intricacies even with scores of such short sessions.<br/><br/>And "blind testing" or "strangers with APs?" Forget it. VERY few LARP organizations with whom I could get in touch would be willing to run such a "full test" for me, in lieu of their monthly campaigns. So I also lack the sort of blind testing that a tabletop RPG can enjoy just by being available for download as a PDF and having the relative small buy-in of one session away from one's "normal, weekly game." SO I will probably always have to make do with guided testing (though I hope that one of my later runs won't require it--I'd like to see various helpers and volunteers interpret the rules, at least once).<br/><br/>So anyhow... no, I won't be buying software with the money. No, I won't be paying one or two or ten folks for artwork. No, I won't be buying a short-run printing, to maximize my profits. I'll be paying the bulk to the state, as fees for State Park campsite rental; the rest will go to promotion, printing (tags, character sheets), and maybe even sets and props. The beneficiaries will be the very playtesters that help to make the system "perfect."

If I'm not happy with the result I would feel bad about trying to sell it, or even give it away free for that matter. See, if I just wanted to put out a game pure and simple, that's easy. Mix up a PDF, stick it on Lulu, fire and forget publishing. But that's not enough for me. I want my games to play well, look good and get noticed, and I don't have to skill set or brand recognition to accomplish all of those objectives alone. I mean it sure would be nice to put a game on the gaming store shelves again. I got all my best sales figures that way. But you can't expect Lulu sales to go well enough to support that. Not every game's development is going to run as well as Diaspora's, especially when you're as bad at PR as I am. After all, what use is making a game if nobody plays it? Sure I could solicit for free stuff, but that just adds a second layer of guilt and, as I said before, clipart is rarely suitable for the kind of games I make.<br/><br/>But, you know, feel free to talk about your own book too. I can't promise it will be useful to me, or that I'll agree entirely with what you have to say, but it might prove useful to others. For that matter, if there's any questions I can answer for you, please feel free to ask. I'm not the biggest expert in the field, but I can at least claim some measure of expertise on the physical and logistical side of things, having been through the process before (assuming you haven't, of course.)<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297660/#Comment_297660" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T13:11:08+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  1:11PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ash,<br/>\n  I am right there with you brother. It seems so deceptively simple. There are a ton of free-ish resources out there. You can make the pdf using Open Office, You can get the word out with a blog, or on cool forums like this. but, unless you are also a good artist, you can't publish on the cheap.<br/>\n  And, unfortunately, the quality and quantity of art in a game book goes directly into the acceptance and reviews of RPGs. IT has created a barrier to entry to really get your game out, get it noticed and get it played.<br/>\n  I can't tell you if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but I can say that it is reality. I think the reason that some designers haven't had that experience is because they are fairly talented artists in their won right. I am thinking of Jon Walton, Shreyas and even Vince Baker. My vision is terrible and the art I can create on my own is pretty average. So, if I want to get near the artistic content level required for this market, I have to either somehow get a artist to work pro-bono, or for a percent of the profit, or do some other finagling in order to get published, noticed and played.<br/>\n  In the end, I went with a publisher. If it goes well, I will share my experiences and let you guys know how it works as an alternate solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, Lester, you are a saint.

There's no way Blowback would have gotten made without the DivNull Lark. Well, okay, maybe eventually somehow, but Shreyas and I had crazy life changes and financial upheavals and other freakouts, not to mention a wedding two weeks before the release date. Blowback would have been back-burnered at best. It was the money, the luxury of knowing it was set apart and I didn't have to feel guilty for spending it on my game. And it was knowing that I had to get this shit done and it had to be something awesome, because Lester mentioned that <i>if it went well</i> he might do another $1000 the next year. I felt like I owed it to the people who submitted and didn't get the cash, and the people who had an idea but were worried about the cash it'd take to make it a reality, to do the best game I could and hold up my end of the deal. Me not wanting to be the reason Lester stopped doing the contest was a HUGE motivator.<br/><br/>That said.<br/><br/>I really don't know why everyone thinks good automatically means more expensive. There's nothing I can do in InDesign that I couldn't do with additional time in Pages. If you're looking for something to invest in that will make your layout better, don't spend $700 on InDesign, spend $40 on a really good graphic design primer. Subscribe to graphic design and layout resource blogs, read the articles, download the free fonts that are professional-quality and GOOD. <br/><br/>As far as art goes, if you're married to an idea and you won't sacrifice your artistic integrity\u2014 if it means giving up on a game because you can't afford the art of your dreams\u2014 well, that's your decision. Mist-Robed Gate spent $15 on stock art for the cover. Two thirds of the interior art was from a royalty-free clip art book of Japanese kimono patterns we got at Barnes and Noble for $18. Shreyas could have thrown a hissy over using Japanese kimono patterns when he spent so much time on the authenticity of the Mandarin and the recipes\u2014 and frankly, I expected him to. But he rolled with it.<br/><br/>Blowback's art is lavishly, horrifically expensive to me. When I decided to change the cover background to the suburbs instead of an oil pipeline in the desert, I thought to myself "Oh God, do I really want to spend another $15 on this cover? I already spent $35!" The total for art was $211. It's easy to say "Oh, stock photography doesn't work for every game," and I'd agree with you wholeheartedly. But if you never saw Blowback, would you think that a game about badass spies would really lend itself to stock photos? It's not like it's a game about multi-ethnic businessmen shaking hands or white women going to the spa. <br/><br/>Oh, and It's Complicated Revised. I've gotten nothing but compliments on the sickeningly cute anime art. That's all stock, too\u2014 there are only two full-page illustrations in the game, and some talking heads for examples and a flower motif. It cost me less than the cover for Blowback. I suck as an artist\u2014 though I'm an okay graphic designer. I can certainly manipulate artwork though, and it was just a matter of creating multiple expressions for the little talking heads to bring them to life. When I was first working on the revision, I wanted WAY more art than that\u2014 I wanted a full-page illo every few pages, like in the original version. I added thousands of words, and because I took out so much of the art, the page count's identical. No one's asked me why I put so little art in a game that is ostensibly anime-driven. <br/><br/>I've said this stuff before, and I've been dismissed as a rare case, because I've been successful\u2014 so clearly my initial success with publishing for nearly no money is based on my now-existent fame and popularity, even though half the people I met when I was selling It's Complicated thought I was Ben's girlfriend Alexis, and I still get called Emily Shoemaker (even by my neighbor, JULIA BOND ELLINGBOE, on TELEVISION). I don't think it matters who you are. If you've got a good product, and you believe in your product enough to be flexible with its presentation, you can make it happen.<br/><br/>And if you need help figuring out how, let me know. I'd be happy to help you figure out lower-cost art alternatives that offer the same feeling, or introduce you to people who might want to help you collaborate, or whatever. Just please don't say money's why you can't make something you believe in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297717/#Comment_297717" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T22:01:02+00:00" title="October 20, 2010 10:01PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Elizabeth!
