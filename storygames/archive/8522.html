The Foundry is a chat server with a "room" feel rather than the "channel" feel of IRC. It's built on TinyMUSH 3.1 software, which gives every account access to its built-in building and programming language, though it's arcane and bizarre.<br/><br/>In the past, folks have used The Foundry as a place to hang out and chat. Occasionally, people run games there. We have built code for generic dice and cards, and there are additional tools specific to certain games (like Dogs or Roach, for example).<br/><br/>Most people will want to use a mushclient program to connect. I recommend SimpleMU for Windows, TinyFugue for Linux, and Atlantis for Mac. The Foundry web site should have links to these free programs. You can use "raw" telnet to connect, if you really want.

Say: for less than 20 players, to be played as a single "instance" in less than 20 hours of play, but then can be re-set and played again, with a completely different outcome? I'm thinking of a game with a very larp-like premise, as in: a group of people trapped on a spaceship or submarine that is in trouble, where they're running around trying to fix things and uncover who the saboteur is.  Something like that.  Or a single Dogs town would be another good example, running from the Dogs arrival to judgment, with people playing both Dogs and townsfolk.  Basically, I'm wondering whether there are small, non-persistent MUSHs and, if not, why not (or what would be the challenges of implementing one).  I'm interested, I guess, in applying the lessons of focused design to MUSH-like things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189583/#Comment_189583" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T11:15:47+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 11:15AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Cleaver</cite>If I remember correctly you can build your own rooms, but you need a wizard (Adam or myself) to create doors from the main areas.</blockquote>\nRight, but linking to the main area is overrated.

Maybe not as focused as you're talking. There are small sandbox games that are basically a GM and 5-10 players. Not so much with the coded environment, though.<br/><br/>What you seem to be describing is exactly what MUD has been doing since the mid-70's, and this is exactly what TinyMUD and its children (like the TinyMUSH server I run) were designed to handle. In the old days, players did build little subgames. People don't do that much anymore. <br/><br/>I'd love to code up Waiting/Tea as a little game area on Foundry. I don't think it'd be that hard.

Of course, both Geiger and Transan benefit from players being able to see, visually, the layout of the entire space, which MUSHs have traditionally not done, I think (though Castle Marrach did).  Honestly, it would be interesting to design not so much a small-scale MUSH itself but, um, rules for playing in a MUSH environment.  Like, y'know, you can only create a new location if XYZ conditions are met and then you have to connect it to location B and create PDQ objects with certain kinds of traits/description.  More like the rules for PTA or Universalis or Mist-Robed Gate than the rules for a D&amp;D module, y'know?  Where the ability of players to alter the environment was taken for granted and strongly incorperated into the guidelines for play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189601/#Comment_189601" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T12:36:17+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 12:36PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>It's unlimited right now.

It'd be pretty easy to build your "personal sets" as rooms. As you started scenes, you might need to have everyone relocate to the next set, but that's not a huge deal. I recommend organizing it like a movie set. Have a central area for the director and crew, and then have specific sets attached to it. You might even set up a conference room to get people into the mindset of planning the stuff before and between episodes.<br/><br/>Use character descriptions (<a href="/forums/profile/desc%29">@desc)</a> to record information about each character (stuff usually on the sheet). Also, feel free to create extra characters for games and stuff. You don't have to try to recycle your normal player account. I'm really not worried about the database size.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
