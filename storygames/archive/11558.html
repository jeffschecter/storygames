Now, I'm not too fussed about <i>Getting It Right</i> because it's all about having fun, right? But there's a lingering suspicion I'm under-equipped to run a crawl in the true style of my <i>Dungeon Master</i> forebears. <br/><br/>So, I was wondering if anyone has any information regarding old-school APs, podcasts, campaign-notes, essays or general advice floating about? It'd be awesome to sit down at that table with a mind spinning with awesomely retro things to hurl at my players.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Mike.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257529/#Comment_257529" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T06:41:47+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  6:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd start at <a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Grognardia</a> and read through the Dimmwermount posts.

So - for example - when you're naming classes, call it a "Warrior" instead of a "Fighter" and a "Wizard" instead of a "Magic-user". <br/><br/>I mean, I personally might want to see magic-users and descending Armor Classes in an old-school game, but that's because I remember them from 1986, not because there is anything inherently fun or cool about those things. So if you're playing with a group who has no nostalgic attachment  to that stuff, why strive to re-create it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257634/#Comment_257634" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T14:32:56+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  2:32PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd second reading Eero's post.

It's an excellent source of short dungeons that in many ways hits the sweet spot of context for me. Just the sort of thing where I could just lift an arbitrary dungeon from there and improvise the rest of the backstory in play. I especially like how Tony's format completely eliminates the empty room as a pacing element. (Are they pacing elements in those old designs? No idea.) There's no need for filler encounters or anything, you can just run through the dungeon in one session, over 3-4 distinct and memorable encounters, instead of making a tedious production with a dozen random encounters out of it. I'm keenly waiting for the print version, or perhaps some sort of randomization tool that'd index and link these for ease of use.<br/><br/>Another thing I'm pretty fond of are the massive hex maps they used to make for old D&amp;D campaign settings. Stuff like <a href="http://pandius.com/Known_World_24_Miles_Per_Hex.png" rel="nofollow">this</a>. The Dragonlance campaign is in many ways incomprehensible if you don't know about hex map wilderness campaigns, for example, so this is important stuff. I really should figure out some campaign that'd use this sort of thing - I've never played such a game yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257660/#Comment_257660" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T16:06:27+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  4:06PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Another thing I'm pretty fond of are the massive hex maps they used to make for old D&amp;D campaign settings.

For example, a pretty old school conceit is to extend a player's character authority into determining many things about the character's background, and therefore even the society and issues of that background. If a character is an elf, it's pretty old school -natural to have that player make major contributions about what it means to be an elf, which is the same as determining what elves are like in the game world.<br/><br/>Probably the most important thing to my mind is to know the time and place - I could see myself asking the players in between session about what they think about the idea of placing a large desert to the west of the basetown of a campaign, for example. That's something the characters presumably know about either way. I wouldn't, however, make that same question when the characters have just heard that the McGuffin is to the west and the characters are preparing to leave for a long journey there - how is the player supposed to answer that sort of question, except by reminding the GM that it is in fact his job to decide and describe that sort of thing so the players can react to it, not the other way around. Tell me as a player that there is a desert to the west, and I'll know to pack extra water. Don't ask me whether there is such a desert, for on what basis would I make this choice?<br/><br/>Of course that's just setting canon (or backstory, as we often call it nowadays). In my experience you can be much more equal about narrating conflict resolutions and such without making a mess of the GM role. By all means let players narrate their character actions without constant affirmations from you, too - I've never quite understood the point in asking the GM whether there is an inn in town when you could just declare such and expect the GM to correct you if he wants; presumably the GM is listening to what you say, so you don't need to explicitly ask his permission for every little thing separately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258199/#Comment_258199" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T14:16:24+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  2:16PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2010 2:16PM by rafial.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think anybody has yet referenced Matt Finch's <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/3019374" rel="nofollow">Old School Primer</a>.

The travel from one adventure location to another is important to him, not having a social framework to fall back on.<br/><br/>I like the large dungeon (done it), I like wilderness sandbox (sort of done it), I like even set-piece adventures (done it) as long as they're well designed and respect the role of the players and their characters. I'd have to say that my choice would depend largely on personal GMish inspiration - first I'd have some idea of what I'd like to play fiction-wise, and that would then determine the structure.<br/><br/>One way to look at this is as an issue of initial focus: if you start the play from the dungeon door, that's a different initial experience from if you start at an inn. My longest D&amp;D campaign used a specific inn-based procedure: the players would make certain city-based information gathering moves, and I'd give them a list of rumours from a pre-prepared list on the basis of their effectiveness in this work-mongering. The information collection would then result in a number of different types of adventure hooks, among which the players would choose which to go after. These hooks would differ in terms of reliability, level of danger, consequences for ignoring, character-based relevance and so on, so the adventuring party would have to argue among themselves whether they should investigate a potential danger to the city, uncertain rumours about an enemy cult or other priorities.<br/><br/>My point in describing the above is that if you'd find that sort of initial scene interesting, then you might want to go with a sandbox. If, on the other hand, you want to ensure that the first session is already solidly adventurous and not just logistical, then you might choose to start the game from the dungeon door. A sandbox is more work than a set-piece adventure like the <i>Fury of Nifur</i> (at my blog) in some ways, although good GM technique can cut the prep down to a minimum - I used to think up around 20 new hooks every three sessions when the characters got back to town, but I usually wouldn't make any detailed prep for the potential adventures behind them, improvising the necessary details on the spot as the game proceeded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling" title="Maltese_Changeling"><img alt="Maltese_Changeling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling">Maltese_Changeling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258580/#Comment_258580" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T18:42:47+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  6:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The funny thing about Conan is that the travel was almost never the point: Howard tended to handwave that most of the time.

Sure, we know the distances and we know the times taken but its rare that the author unpacks the travelling experience unless it feeds into a set piece. Amongst the generally abstracted travel sections there are several instances of characters flying across a great many miles on preternaturally fast horses or eagles, or simply having their journeys described in a line or two ("... and back again."). <br/><br/>It strikes me Tolkien doesn't like random encounter-tables much either...

The rest of the time, Tolkien is very careful to describe the process of travel, accounting for the specific terrain traversed, the time taken to do so, and the specific distance in leagues covered.

The rest of the time, Tolkien is very careful to describe the process of travel, accounting for the specific terrain traversed, the time taken to do so, and the specific distance in leagues covered.  I'm rereading the book right now as part of teaching it to college undergraduates, and it's very clear that this is his customary approach.<br/><br/>(For random encounters, I give you the crebain and the wargs in Hollin in "The Ring Goes South" as well as the orcs at Sarn Gebir in "The Great River.")<br/><br/>My main point has not been that sandbox exploration games moving hex by hex are bad--if that's what everyone wants to do, they're wonderful.  Instead, it's that that sort of game does not seem to be inspired in any way by the actual stories that Howard and Leiber and the other S&amp;S writers were writing.</blockquote>\nYou're focusing in on one thing (detailed accounts of travel) while rejecting almost everything else. Early D&amp;D was very much like S&amp;S in its amorality, its greed, its human-centric worldview and its emphasis on law vs. chaos - all of which are pretty much anathema to Tolkien, and are much more central to the question than whether or not the Lord of the Ring superficially resembles a hex crawl. (In any case, don't forget the earliest forms of D&amp;D didn't even have hexcrawls - that came later.)<br/><br/>The crebain and warg encounters are in my view explicit examples of Sauron extending his spies and influence further Northwards and Westwards in search of the ring, and using his power and malice to influence things to his benefit. (He knows the ring is out there...somewhere. The avalanche/snowstorm in the mountains which drives the fellowship into Moria is another example of this.) This makes them almost the opposite of random; a true random encounter is exactly that - rolled up on a chart, with no meaning or relevance to anything outside of itself and what meaning the players/DM attach to it afterwards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258653/#Comment_258653" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T05:55:57+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  5:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're not entirely serious about the Tolkien thing, Jean.

Maybe not the first generation or two, but certainly those who started by the very late 1970s (when I got into the game).

The game will run much smoother if you assume:<br/><br/>a) The PCs are rogues, not heroes - the rules expect this (XP for money, comparatively little XP for monsters killed, no XP for roleplaying) and demand it (PC death is pretty common, so nobody is going to stick around long enough to save the world even if it needed it); <br/>and<br/>b) There's a world going on entirely independently of the players, so encounters don't have to "make sense" and/or conform to any kind of plot or story.<br/><br/>The key element of old school play is that it's sandboxy. Player initiative is important. A lot of DMs give their players a list of a dozen or so rumours when the game begins, so they can follow their own noses with an element of choice. Rumours might be as banal as "there's a troll living under a bridge nearby" or as deliberately weird as "an army of flying monkeys has invaded the lowlands". It's likely that at least one will be something along the lines of "you've heard talk from the locals about an ancient temple/cave network/abandoned castle/etc., etc.", i.e. a dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258690/#Comment_258690" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T08:45:56+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  8:45AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noisms</cite>a) The PCs are rogues, not heroes - the rules expect this (XP for money, comparatively little XP for monsters killed, no XP for roleplaying) and demand it (PC death is pretty common, so nobody is going to stick around long enough to save the world even if it needed it)</blockquote>\nI like this.

It's simply less hassle. Narrate: "After several hours of travel you finally find the foxhole farmer McGritty complained about. Except it's not a foxhole, not unless foxes are three feet tall and are in the habit of leaving the boots and anklebones of their victims scattered in front of the cave. The pitch black cave entrance is ten feet from where you've crawled in the underbush, the rest of the way being over hard rock. The sun is in the zenith and will only get lower from here. What do you do?"<br/><br/>The danger in starting with the pub and the rumourmongering and all that is that the players might pick up the wrong cues about the point of play. Another danger is that the pubbery and travel might take so long that you don't have time to bite deep into the dungeon during the first session. Depends on the group whether this is a real concern, of course. The big benefit of starting at the pub is that it helps distill the in-character goals for the players; if you read that treatise of mine, you might have noticed how I think that player-directed motivation is a key part of successful fantasy adventure roleplaying: you want the players to internalize character motivations that they then struggle to execute, rather than just doing things because the GM told them to. But if you find that you have enough to juggle in the dungeon alone, then I believe that allowing the players to orient themselves can wait. Make the first dungeon a simple one, something where the characters can come back carrying a load of expensive furs or objects of art. Then they can waste some time haggling for them in town, hear some rumors and so on. Then, in the second or third session, you can ask them why their group is together and what sort of adventure they might be interested in next. A particularly clever GM would do the rumourmongering and orienting towards a new mission at the end of a session to have time to prepare for whatever direction the players choose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258756/#Comment_258756" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T11:01:42+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 11:01AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm running a brief meeting to do char-gen before the ritual of 'proper sessions' takes place.

For instance, if the characters have the option to go after some minotaur Nazis because a NPC they've interacted with asks them for a real reason, that's a whole different kettle of orientation for a mission than if they've just picked the minotaur Nazis out as a generic adventure lead with no better reason than the fact that minotaur Nazis are always in season.<br/><br/>Of course these more organic goals cannot be created in advance very well, which is why rumours are a fine starting point and baseline the characters can return to when they have nothing better to do. Starting the campaign with a dungeon is a fine choice in that this way the party isn't really running on pure rumor at any point: once they get back to town and choose their next step after the dungeon, they well might already have experiences and attitudes that color their orientation in the fictional world. For example, if the first dungeon introduced them to an ambivalently, potentially evil god of miscegenation, then they'll have extra context later for deciding whether to take up a job for or against the cult in question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259090/#Comment_259090" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T08:02:23+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  8:02AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, iron-mode character generation was taken with all due ambivalence ('I'm a wizard with... 18 strength!?") and I've set them off shopping and generally thinking about what their class means ("What Religion do you follow, Cleric?") before the adventure begins later this week. <br/><br/>Max, Eero - I think you're both right; promoting investment in the game at this stage can only lead to prolonged interest.

Deviating from this simple method is a clear sign of ulterior motives that do not befit a dungeoneer.<br/><br/>And yes, I myself find that advance information will immeasurably improve the D&amp;D challenge scenario, which often becomes immeasurably dull and simplistic by my measure. I would say that it is very easy to give the players too little information, but very hard to give too much. The more they know, the more they can prepare, and the more the eventual failure or success means to them. I've myself noticed very concretely how players given ample foreknowledge happily buzz away with logistics, tactics, resource-consumption planning and other nuances of overcoming a challenge. Compared to this a group that learns to just sit dumbly and wait for the GM to declare the next encounter is a truly sad sight, especially when the D&amp;D combat encounter in fictional isolation is nothing to write home about in terms of player engagement and challengeful variety. When the players have an even hand in any trouble the characters encounter, eventual defeat will also feel less arbitrary and more acceptable; after all, they knew what they were getting into, or at least knew that information is available and the GM expects them to take responsibility for their own fate.<br/><br/>One of my most memorable "dungeons" ever was an evil temple. The players had full map of the place's layout, a crazy necromancer NPC ally, a half-finished tunnel to the interior, an army of necromantic abominations and ample alchemical warfare at their beck and call for an assault on the place.

This is for solid game design reasons, I feel, so it's a shame that many people seem to find the random chargen just a sorry artifact of the past that should be replaced by more player control.<br/><br/>The main philosophical argument for random character generation is that the random element provides the player with an incontroversible, unique mechanical landscape against which he gets to make his choices. Because it's random and created on the spot, the player can't pre-play or develop hang-ups about always playing a half-elf ranger or whatever. Instead he has to look at what he gets and compromise with the facts. This is healthier as an overall attitude in my games, as I do my best to strip the game of any notion of "character development" that does not correspond to in-character motivation; no pre-planned feat selections, prestige classes, probably not even fully public class progressions. Considering this attitude, it would be counter-productive if a player got to develop his character in a very controlled, replicable way.<br/><br/>Ultimately I simply think that a player should have no reason to want this control at the early stage in character creation, and if he does (wanting to play a wizard or nothing, say), then he should cast aside these hang-ups and focus that burning passion on in-play achievement. One of the biggest mechanical differences with my D&amp;D is probably that character abilities are much more fluid than expected; not only are there plenty of magical or otherwise exceptional opportunities for messing with them, but the abilities can also develop as they are used, sort of like Runequest skills. So if you want to play a wizard, but the ability scores didn't allow that, maybe you could make your character a wizard through play, hmm?<br/><br/>The negative facet of this is simple, too - when I end up playing with a point-buy or other controlled chargen system, I absolutely require the game to also have a clear creative orientation for me to follow. I don't like it at all if a game just gives me a setting and a bunch of character options and tells me to create whatever character I want. That sort of thing works if you're a frustrated author or have a favourite character you play in every game, but if you come to the game wide open, that system leaves you hanging. I just don't usually have the requisited inner frustration that tells me to pick the most powerfullest character class out of the twenty options. Much less disorienting to roll some dice and follow their lead. Quicker, too - I remember vividly how uselessly long the <i>Runeslayers</i> chargen is in comparison to simplified D&amp;D.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>As for in-character communication, I'm strongly against any sort of external control in this regard. The GM can encourage colorful and fiction-supporting language by his own example, but trying to enforce anything is foolish - the players won't do it unless they feel like it, and them feeling it isn't helped by GM control. Commit to a creative fiction, and it will be expressed in how the players play their characters, including proper use of out-of-character knowledge and other such worries.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260140/#Comment_260140" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T00:14:57+00:00" title="March  5, 2010 12:14AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Eero said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260144/#Comment_260144" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T01:49:11+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  1:49AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero is 100 per cent correct, and he put it very eloquently too.<br/><br/>It's also worth pointing out that <i>especially</i> in Original D&amp;D, but also right through B/X, BECMI and even 1st edition AD&amp;D, stats hardly matter. In OD&amp;D, pretty much all high stats give you is a bonus to experience point gains. And that's only one stat - the prime requisite. Mechanically, it doesn't make much difference if, for instance, your fighter has an intelligence of 3 or 18, though obviously you'll probably roleplay it differently.<br/><br/>Stats only really started to matter in AD&amp;D, when you need high stats in order to play certain character classes, like rangers or paladins. This sometimes leads to criticism of the system - I really want to play a paladin but it's so damn hard to roll 17 for CHR and 13 for STR! (Or whatever it was.) Here the point Eero is making applies even more forcefully: <i>why not make your character a paladin through play?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260147/#Comment_260147" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T02:01:52+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  2:01AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I adore the idea of an \xfcber-class that you can only get by rolling well in chargen.

A great thing about old-school games is that it's easy to bolt on mechanics when you need them for a specific situation, and discard them when you don't without disrupting the rest of the system or disappointing the players' expectations. You could roll under the stat on a d20 with modifiers for difficulty, or roll under the stat on 2d6 for an easy task, 3d6 for an average one, 4d6 for a real challenge.<br/><br/>Potemkin, for long-term old-school play I can't emphasize strongly enough how much giving XP for both getting <i>and spending</i> gold has paid off. The advantage of XP for getting gold is that it's a very concrete goal that there are a zillion ways to achieve, and it's easy to monetize any other kind of motivation (i.e., if the players do something cool and you want to reward them for it, think of who in the setting would pay to have proof it was done, or to get in good with the people responsible). The advantage of XP for spending gold is that it's a great way for players to engage with the setting and show what things their character cares about. I like to do this as a gambling game - if you roll well you achieve your aims as planned, if you roll poorly I get to introduce complications. The specifics of the way I do it are <a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2009/10/08/wine-women-and-song-experience-points/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, plus a treatise on the roots of the idea, but again these are mechanics that are easy to invent and change as it suits you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260390/#Comment_260390" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-06T00:33:03+00:00" title="March  6, 2010 12:33AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that was recently mentioned on one of the OSR blogs that I read is that characters in early editions of D&amp;D don't start off special or heroic because at low levels it's a distinct possibility that they'll die.

Pressing on regardless, I yelled my opening preamble, answered character-generation queries and attempted to give a little in the way of explanation as to old-school preconceptions. Of course, I lost a great deal of detail and atmosphere but rarely do we achieve the level of perfection to which we aspire, especially under trying circumstance. The players loved 'How do you know the man to your left,' each striving to make his victim as indebted or endeared to the speaker's character as possible. Whether or not the players identified with their characters the better for this remains to seen, but it certainly broke some ice in the group and eased everyone into the idea of roleplaying fiction. <br/><br/>As we came to the meat of the session (with what little time was remaining), I suddenly felt woefully unprepared! The rough sketches I'd done for an opening dungeon and the few half-baked descriptives I'd rattling in my head didn't, I feel, stand up well to the scrutiny of six inquisitors. I attempted to impress with grandeur; confusing scale with substance, but found that 'cinematics' didn't challenge the players and they treated it with the dispassionate objectivity of a video-game cut-scene as befitting media-savvy moderns. Awesome is indeed the enemy. <br/>Wheeling out a bevy of giant rats and skeletons provided some excitement but I feel I neglected a wealth of possibilities available to me with the freedom inherent in the system and corresponding style of gameplay. I wonder, can I really (re)live the old-school without graduating in the first place? Truly, is this what I seek?<br/><br/>All these questions and more answered next week, same bat-time, same bat-channel!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260634/#Comment_260634" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T01:32:42+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  1:32AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep with it, this is interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260692/#Comment_260692" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T10:27:25+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 10:27AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I look forward to reading more AP! You might consider using one or more existing dungeons to help with your preparations. Because there is so much freedom inherent in the system, and a potential burden on the referee, I find it relaxing to use allegiance to a published text as a way of delegating some of my authority over the world, Likewise I like to delegate authority over what happens next to the dice, discussing the odds with the players when appropriate before I roll. In each case the fun is in making sense of strange things that don't come from me, just as I do when I'm a player. I particularly like the dungeons reprinted in the Dungeoneer Compendium; they're bracingly strange and old, and just the right size and modularity to sprinkle around in a sandbox.<br/>\n<br/>\nEero, I'd love to hear more about the ways you alter ability scores. In reading old dungeons I'm forever seeing fountains that raise PC ability scores and thinking "I won't use that in my game because I like OD&amp;D;'s de-emphasis on ability scores" - whereas this thread reminds me that what I really like is rules that don't overly define what scores mean, allowing us to do so. I'm sure that none of my players would pass up a drink from that fountain because "scores don't matter!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260701/#Comment_260701" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T11:05:40+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 11:05AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 11:06AM by tony_dowler.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion is getting more and more interesting.

The downside is that parsing, understanding, and using it is an art, and it has a learning curve. There's definitely a practice to becoming a better GM.

However, I do not feel it is perfect. In one of the OD&amp;D games I played, I rolled every single ability somewhere between 9 and 11.

Certainly it was this way in the games I played in!  So a character with low Int was usually played as stupid, with low Wis as foolish or impulsive, with low Cha as ugly or unlikable.  And we're talking about a collection of five or more interlinked games with a player pool of 50+ players and a heavy involvement in the D&amp;D APA community of the 70's and 80's, so I don't think it was that isolated an example.<br/><br/>Really, we played "roll 3d6 six times", not because we liked the results, but because we were a mostly bunch of wargamers and that was what was in the rules.  Personally, if I never play another game with random character generation again, it will be too soon.  One gets <em>tired</em> of roleplaying an Int 8/Wis 4 character after a while.<br/><br/>Also, the supposed deadliness of old school games?  It really, really depended.  In my personal experience, it was only true at 1st to 2nd level.  Most people ran the same characters for years, and permanent high-level character death was really rare.<br/><br/>Honestly, as someone who played OD&amp;D from publication, I would strongly recommend taking a lot of the Old School Renaissance stuff with a grain of salt the size of your head.  A lot of what I see on the subject really only applies to one particular style of game, and not in my experience, a very common style, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260744/#Comment_260744" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T13:10:41+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  1:10PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A lot of what I see on the subject really only applies to one particular style of game, and not in my experience, a very common style, either.</blockquote>\n...and some of it has very little to do with old school D&amp;D per se, and everything to do with running kickass games in the absence of dysfunctional sosical dynamics with a GM who isn't afraid of fiat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260749/#Comment_260749" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T13:16:31+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  1:16PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nikodemus</cite>A lot of what I see on the subject really only applies to one particular style of game, and not in my experience, a very common style, either.</blockquote>\n...and some of it has very little to do with old school D&amp;D per se, and everything to do with running kickass games in the absence of dysfunctional sosical dynamics with a GM who isn't afraid of fiat.<br/>Heh.

Maybe it has something to do with teaching a style where there's a lot of randomness that needs to be dealt with in-play and learning to go outside of (written) system to deal with it.<br/><br/>I would point out that in earlier editions, stats mean much, much less, generally, anyway. The bonuses they give are pretty small, and don't tend to restrict characters all that much anyway. Also, the Moldvay Basic, the version of D&amp;D which I'm most familiar with, already has methods for modifying stat rolls after generation. IMO, they work fairly well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260852/#Comment_260852" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T03:28:06+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  3:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A central artifact in my sort-of-ongoing fantasy campaign is called the "Alder Gate". This product of eldritch arboreal craft resides deep under a city built over a long-abandoned underground laboratory / pleasure palace of a legendary wizard. The gate takes you to the Other Side, which is explicitly not a direct part of the game environment (no scenes set in there, that is), and thus it's pretty vague what the Other Side actually <i>is</i>. However, many of those who choose to step into the Alder Gate also come out after an indeterminate time. Their wounds and diseases heal, their skin bleaches unnaturally white, their hair and eyes might change colors, too, and all of their ability scores are rerolled with a doubles-explode rule, and the new scores are then arranged by size to match the nature of the old array.<br/><br/>(Hmm... I should publish some more of this stuff in my blog, really - I have some session reports stashed away, I wonder why I've forgotten to put them up...)<br/><br/>Whether this procedure produces elves or Melniboneans or angels or demons or what is sort of a point of discovery for the campaign. At least it should be obvious to a player that undergoing the "treatment" is a carte blanche for the GM to mess about with the character's integrity; perhaps it is worth it if you don't like your current ability scores. (For what it's worth, the only guy actively seeking for this thing is a power-mad merchant prince who's convinced that the Alder Gate can heal his son's deadly ailment.) It's also pretty obvious to me that something like rolling average or bad ability scores is ultimately a completely meaningless complaint in a campaign environment that includes this sort of stuff. Even the most down-to-earth sword &amp; sorcery fiction involves personal transformations, prophets chosen by gods and other such stuff that might elevate anybody, no matter how low their Strength score, into a Very Important Person. There is no reason to get hung up about character protagonism just because your character doesn't have high scores; it seems to me like the worst kind of simplicity if your character being interesting and important is dependent on mechanical entitlement instead of in-fiction material. If only your scores matter, is that because there is not enough fictional context for events to do anything else but roll dice against that score?<br/><br/>In comparison, I don't quite understand the point of some rule about rerolling your scores until you get sufficiently high ones - isn't it much more interesting to step through the Alder Gate to get that reroll? Or find a magic item that allows you to use an ancient warrior's strength score as your own? Or retreat into a monastery for a decade to improve in a natural way? Lots of options that are open to characters if you get rid of the idea that ability scores are permanent and should only be changed systematically every fourth level or whatever. That static view of ability scores, combined with the impact they have on character strength, breeds resentment and frustration. (With good reason, too, if you ask me - the world of modern D&amp;D is a caste society of haves and have nots insofar as ability score distributions go.) In my own rules ability scores are pretty influential in determining your success (practically all checks are ability + class level + d20 against a set difficulty), but they also fluctuate about as easily as your experience level, so it's not the end of the world if you start play with a weak character - it's a bit more challenge to begin with, that's all, but smart play will make the character just as powerful as the next guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260855/#Comment_260855" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T03:33:42+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  3:33AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, about wanting to play a fighter and not getting a good Strength score...

For instance, "Draw one card for each ability. The ability with the highest card draw gets a 16, the second highest a 13, the third an 11, the fourth a 10, the fifth a 9 and the last a 6." It's random, yes, but it's fair.<br/><br/>That said, random stats can be tons of fun, as long as they're not the backbone of the game and unchangeable. Rolling stats in OD&amp;D was a lot of fun, because you knew you couldn't get screwed over. If your fighting man had a strength of 4 (or whatever), it was merely a fun detail for the fiction, since the stats didn't give you any bonuses or penalties for anything except experience points.<br/><br/>A <i>fair</i> method is only necessary if your fun depends on those stat values--for instance, in some versions of D&amp;D having low stats could be crippling or keep you from qualifying for any classes.<br/><br/>Note, though, that random generation is supposed to work like this:<br/><br/>1. Roll the dice<br/>2. Determine the character concept.<br/><br/>Not the other way around! If you say, "I want to play the handsome barbarian", and <i>then</i> you roll 3d6 in order... well, yeah, you're not going to be happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261031/#Comment_261031" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T14:37:58+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  2:37PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>1.

My longest D&amp;D campaign used a specific inn-based procedure: the players would make certain city-based information gathering moves, and I'd give them a list of rumours from a pre-prepared list on the basis of their effectiveness in this work-mongering. The information collection would then result in a number of different types of adventure hooks, among which the players would choose which to go after. These hooks would differ in terms of reliability, level of danger, consequences for ignoring, character-based relevance and so on, so the adventuring party would have to argue among themselves whether they should investigate a potential danger to the city, uncertain rumours about an enemy cult or other priorities.</blockquote>\nI'd like to talk more on this topic: how you set up the adventure and how you differentiate between being on an adventure and getting ready for it.

Supplement I - <i>Greyhawk</i>,  released in 1975 (one year after the original brown box D&amp;D) included bonuses to hit and damage for higher strength for fighters, to armor class for higher dexterity (again for fighters), bonuses to hit points for higher constitution (for everyone), and intelligence now determined the maximum level spells and the chance of knowing spells for magic users.  At the time (1975), Greyhawk was pretty widely adopted, at least among the old SF Fan and Wargamer networks (both of which groups put old magazines of various sorts and held conventions, allowing communication to occur).  Later supplements were not so widely adopted for various reasons, but Greyhawk, along with its bonuses for characteristics was.  Also, a lot of groups expanded the bonuses for Strength and Dexterity to all classes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262269/#Comment_262269" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T09:41:06+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  9:41AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2010 9:42AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right. Strike my use of the term "OD&amp;D" and mentally replace it with something like "the earliest versions of the game", which is where the roots of the hobby rest. After all, people had been playing D&amp;D for quite a while before 1975, and they were the ones who had instituted the random attribute generation scheme in question.<br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>That's interesting, right, but it in a best-case scenario it only allows the "low stats" people to catch up to the "high stats" people. And in games like D&amp;D, gaining experience is usually tied to success, so I still think my proposal is a little more interesting in terms of making randomized stats set up an interesting starting position as opposed to setting people at a disadvantage without any compensation other than increased challenge in play.<br/><br/>However, a combination of the two approaches is interesting: you can easily increase low stats, but if you do so, you lose the applicable experience bonus. Now that's an interesting tradeoff! In effect, raising your stats kind of "freezes" your character in place; leaving them low signals you want to keep progressing and experiencing the challenge of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262314/#Comment_262314" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T12:13:44+00:00" title="March 16, 2010 12:13PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I totally failed to thank Bevdog and Eero for listing my Microdungeons as a resource.
