<p>(is this the right category?)</p>
<p>I'm just starting to seriously playtest a design, and I'm interested in the experiences people have had with playtesting; how does one go about it? Do you simply throw a text at some players and ask them to mess with it until it breaks? Do you walk them through it? What's worked for you, what didn't?</p>
<p>(And also, if you're interested in mythology and looking for a new toy, I'm looking for such people as playtesters.)</p>

                            When I playtested Kathanaksaya with a local group, I pretty much ran a game for the players using pregen characters.  I didn't go in there with a preset goal or anything, just to observe how it works in play.  As a rules arbiter, I was only there to clarify things (which made it to tweaks in the system).  One of the things that really worked about this is that the players stumbled upon something unexpected that I wanted to encourage, and I wrote in rules for allowing that to happen.<br/>
<br/>
As far as being interested in mythology and new toys, I'm game, but that depends upon when, where, and how you want to set something up.  After playtesting yours for a bit, I can show you what I'm working on, and we can see what we can do from there.  Perhaps we can take turns running independent playtests of each other's games.                        </div>

                            I think its productive to lay out your goals for the session and get everyone on the same page about that - as in, hey guys, here are known issues (PvP conflict resolution, wonky magic system, whatever) and I know there's more here that needs work. Ask everyone to keep a critical eye on play. This doesn't mean you shouldn't be actually playing, but I know that I take way more notes during a playtest than I do doing "normal" play.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I prefer if people hold major comments until after the game, but thats just me. My reasoning is it's easy to get drawn into a discussion about fixes, which I would rather not deal with during play. <br/>
<br/>
Also, if you game in a specific schedule, build in time for explanation and feedback at the beginning and end. I find that at least half an hour at the end is pretty good for sitting back and getting feedback from the group about play. <br/>
<br/>
Is that the kind of stuff you're looking for?                        </div>

                            Something I found interesting and useful with <i>Great Ork Gods</i> was having another member of the group doing the GMing. If your game uses specialised roles it's worth trying to get someone else to take them so you can "see the other side".                        </div>

I agree!  I had forgotten to mention that in my previous post, but that is something that we did in my playtest of Kathanaksaya.  I used it for a Matrix game.  Myself and a friend of mine were GMs.  He GMed the real world while I GMed the Matrix.  Up until the end where everyone drifted apart, it was the best game I've ever run.                        </div>

                            I've been helping a lot of people playtest recently.  What each designer has done (so far) is printed out a copy of the game so we can reference it and make notes and then run it straight through.  Beginning to end.   Like they were trying to run a finished product.  <br/>
<br/>
Now also, some poeple prefer that gaming halt while some things are discussed.  Some prefer all comments to be held until the end.  I say make that apparent right out the gate.  And like above, having people making notes on the printed copy of the game will help them remember what it was they were thinking about.  Well, at least for me it helps.  <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, you should have the designer of the game, GM it until they feel it's strong enough to run on its own and then sit back and watch someone else run it and for you.  <br/>
<br/>
Myself and the other playtesters have always asked what the designer wants from the game too so that our input can be better for them.  <br/>
<br/>
And then we try to break.  Purposely.  Hard.  <br/>
<br/>
Is that what you were looking for?                        </div>

                            I found it was useful to have a lot of different types of play: some with me present so I could witness what was hard to get or how things were tending in real life, some where I was not present, so that I got to see how hard/easy it was to interpret what were to me, meaningful directions for play. : ) <br/>
<br/>
The most useful play tests were ones where people wrote up what happened in play, how they applied the rules &amp; what they liked/didn't like about them.  <br/>
<br/>
And, honestly, the alpha testing I've done has been the most important for final design--since that was where I was able to see what would be workable mechanics vs what was shite, and then write accordingly. <br/>
<br/>
good luck with it!<br/>

                            You <b>absolutely need</b> to have playtests where you are there and where you aren't. In the beginning, it's usually best to be present, so you can get all the big stuff worked out. Once you have all the major issues resolved and you're confident you have a working game, then you need to ship the game to some other groups and have them tell you how it went when they ran it. This is the part most people skip, and it shows in many game texts. <br/><br/>When you're present, you can subconsciously steer play in a particular direction, so you skip over holes without realizing it. Giving the game to someone to run reveals those holes.                        </div>

                            Having gotten to playtest a fair amount of games recently, it seems to me that it is good to first try playing it "as intended", since, if it breaks there, you've got big problems, THEN try playing it while twisting and turning all the dials to extremes ("Oh, yeah, what happens if I blow all my dice on this roll?").<br/><br/>From my playtest of Stranger Things, I photocopied a "play packet" of something like 3 or 4 pages of the game that summarised the bare minimum you'd need to know to play, and gave one to each player.  That way, players could reference it during the game itself and also take it with them to think about more if they wanted to.                        </div>

                            Agreeing with everyone:  Play when you are there, play when you aren't.<br/>
<br/>
Your goal in a playtest game -- and you have to communicate this to your at-a-distance playtesters -- is absolutely different from your goal in a regular game.  The goal of a regular game is to have fun.  The goal of a playtest game is to reveal problems in the system.  Thus, as a player in a playtest, you need to take careful notes about what rules get used, what rules don't get used, what rules get changed, and what rules get ignored.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to do this is to ask specifically about individual rules:  "Did you use the Humanization rules?  How did that go?"<br/>

                            Playtesting is the best and worst part of designing a game.  It is unfathomably awesome to see people play your game and hear about people playing your game.  This is why you went through all that effort in the first place, and you get to see it right there in front of you.  Awesome.  On the other hand, having people tell you they'll playtest, that they'll try to arrange a game, that they're going to check it out and give it a thorough read-through... and then never get back to you?  Can suck some hairy donkeyballs, lemme tell you.<br/><br/>So whatever you do, my first and foremost advice on playtesting is to expect about 20-50% involvement based on total downloads and readings.  Do not count on getting feedback from everybody, cause it ain't gonna happen.  Consequently, when you get to that point, you need to cast a <em>wide</em> net to get back anything significant.  Organize and run some "alpha playtest" games yourself first, to get the big issues out of the way, and then get your manuscript in as many hands as you possibly can (side note: you are not hurting sales by doing this).<br/><br/>Write a cover letter; don't send the manuscript off by itself.  <em>Welcome</em> them into the playtest; <em>thank</em> them for playtesting.  Outline what exactly you're trying to get at in the playtest.  Give them explicit instructions on how to contact you directly if they have questions or comments.  Cause you want to talk to them if at all possible.<br/><br/>Additionally, I highly recommend either sending a Feedback Form with your manuscript or offering some online method of discussing the playtest.  I've used forms with limited success; they can be daunting and a disincentive to play in the first place, but they can get you the exacting information you want.  I'm trying the online discussion route now, and I'm really digging on it.<br/><br/>Offer playtesting bylines.  Some people may not care; some people may think that that is the coolest thing in the fucking world.<br/><br/>Initially, especially with your "alpha" playtesting, you can gear a specific game of playtesting to test out a specific aspect of the game.  If you're curious about, say, magic rules, play a game set in the local magic college where everybody plays a magic-weilder, for instance.  It can be an incredibly useful procedure to drop other parts of the game out of that playtest -- character generation, say, or non-magical combat -- so you can examine that one piece specifically.  <em>However</em>, and this is a gigantic however, any time you do this you need to later observe that isolated part of the game in the much broader context of the game as a whole.  Don't ever fall into the trap of considering something in isolation and not in any other way.<br/><br/>Lastly, I recommend not looking at the damn manuscript during playtest (I use a three-month window for playtesting).  List off stuff that you need to look at or edit, but <em>don't do the edits</em> until playtesting is over and you can look over all the feedback all at once.  If nothing else, it's nice to take a vacation from dicking with that one file. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Good luck, man!                        </div>
