He wants to experiment with a style of play your group may not have tried before.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis rule is - you don't speak FOR your character (that his, you don't say what he SAYS) unless you speak AS your character. You have to use direct speech. ALL THE TIME. None of the old "I'll ask the shopkeeper what he's got for sale". It has to be (manly voice) "My good fellow, please, show me your wares". Facial expressions and gestures optional, but you have to use the character's tone and accent as you conceive them to be. This is just for words, not actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ref also does things like Bluff rolls or whatever, if he thinks they're likely to be necessary, BEFORE the dialogue. He keeps the exact result secret (even if he lets you roll your own dice when you're the one doing the Bluffing). He doesn't use the dice result to dictate the outcome of the conversation, but he uses it as a gentle steer for his roleplay, so it still depends on what you say and how you say it, but the GM might be frostier, or warmer, easier or harder to convince, depending on your dice-roll. His reasoning is he doesn't want to interrupt the in-character dialogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me clarify some important points about the model I propose.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. NPCs' roleplay is adjusted to reflect the dice-rolls - the dice-rolls provide the GM with a gentle steer (NOT a straitjacket).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. PCs' roleplay is NOT adjusted to reflect the dice-rolls. The dice-check result is a secret which is known only to the GM. Excellent roleplay from the PLAYERS can make up for terrible dice-rolls and terrible roleplay from the PLAYERS can squash excellent results.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. You are not talking in character all the frickin time. That would be virtually impossible for a tabletop game. It's just that your character says nothing unless you say it AS him - or the ref narrates it.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, the ref can narrate a way around tedious conversations with your assent. <br/>\n<br/>\nComments please.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302576/#Comment_302576" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T08:46:49+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  8:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What kind of comments are you seeking?

Young players need to develop the skills necessary to interpret characters in communicative ways.<br/><br/>As for grown up players, I would prefer the game to support my roleplay whatever I do, as long as I really DO ROLEPLAY to my best ability. So I would like the dice to tell all players, including the GM, that <i>my clumsy in-character speech</i> is in fact the flamboyant oratory of a genius (my character). That is how I like to do it. So I would like the "excellent roleplay" to be inspired by the social dynamics of the game-group, rather than by a chance to roleplay my character out of bad dice-rolls.<br/><br/>The dark shadow of <i>measuring</i> the individual roleplaying-feats like this, is that some players may fall through. The verbally bleak players may see their characters falter in the shadow of the characters with more eloquent players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_302918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302918/#Comment_302918" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T00:15:06+00:00" title="December  2, 2010 12:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2010 12:17AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Why not just give bonuses based on performance?</blockquote>I do.<br/><br/>But I make sure I reward the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">performer</span>, not the performance.
