At this point, I'm not asking for help with the "what would this teach?" question--I can either figure that out on my own or start another discussion later on that. But I'm paid to figure out what students might learn from a particular experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is on the logistics of it. So here are the limitations in my most typical classes:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The classes I'm thinking of have enrollment caps of 25 or 28. At any given point in the semester, the number of people showing up might be as low as 13 or 14 or as high as the cap. No real way to predict with certainty how many on any given day, and rarely will the same exact group show up two days in a row, unless it's "no absences" twice in a row.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Usually my classes are either in 75-minute blocks 2 days a week or 2- or 2-and-a-half hour blocks once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Budget is limited. Printing copies of stuff is no problem. Buying enough d20s for five different groups to play Donjon, for example, would give me pause. But if I really needed to buy five copies of a $20 game, I could do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) No prior experience can be assumed with story-games of any sort. A class might have one or two people who've done D&amp;D or some other conventional RPG, but maybe not even that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me then like the best game for this scenario would be:<br/>\n* super-easy to learn, requiring only a few minutes of explanation and perhaps a reference sheet<br/>\n* built around common or cheap randomizers, like ordinary playing cards or d6s<br/>\n* fast-playing, so that it's possible to complete some kind of story in an hour or so<br/>\n* accessible, in the sense that someone "off the street" can immediately latch onto the concept<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest thing I've been able to think of so far is Once Upon a Time, which would require having enough sets for each group, but everybody knows what a "fairy tale" is, and once you get how the cardplay works, you can pick it up and build a story pretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody know of other games that could work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343702/#Comment_343702" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T06:23:29+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  6:23AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's your specific goal in using a story game instead of another teaching / class management method?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343703/#Comment_343703" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T06:25:41+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  6:25AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may not be what you had in mind at all, but I've heard from a variety of educators (and folks in similar fields) that they wanted to try <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/" rel="nofollow">Microscope</a> as a classroom exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343705/#Comment_343705" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T06:31:11+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  6:31AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2011 6:32AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The guy to talk to is <a href="http://rpg.brouhaha.us/" rel="nofollow">MJ Harnish</a>, who is doing this all the time.

This doesn't need to be something all that specific, though. Clearly, what you're doing here is a larger workload than just your usual teaching methods - thus, there must surely be a reason for you to do it. What is it? What do you want the kids to get out of the experience? <br/><br/>Whenever you stray from the usual teaching methods, you enter the realm of what you could call "experiencial" learning, I guess. You learn by doing stuff instead of just encoding data into your brain. What do you want them to do (what are you doing exactly, when you're playing a story game, in your opinion?) and what do you want them to learn through it?<br/><br/>(Also, it's not a story game, but witness the awesomeness that is <a href="http://www.acadiau.ca/~dreid/games/Game_descriptions/Barnga1.htm" rel="nofollow">Barnga.</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Convenient%20Skill" title="The Convenient Skill"><img alt="The Convenient Skill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Convenient%20Skill">The Convenient Skill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343728/#Comment_343728" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T09:43:53+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  9:43AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How freeform do you want to go?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're open to freeform then FU is a great little system that only requires d6 (and about 4 at that) per group.

Not that it couldn't be done. And done well. But still that seems less likely to be your focus point, given the nature of your inquiry. English or Social Studies are much more obvious ways to lead you to the "How could I use story games to help with this" thought.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear a little more about the teaching circumstances, though. A 50% variance in daily attendance suggests some really extreme circumstances, like prison education or severely emotionally disturbed group living or at the very least a continuation high school (ie. high school for kids kicked out of regular schools). I taught in a pretty bad neighborhood for a year, but I'd only see about 10% absence most of the time.<br/><br/>If it's a continuation school, I'd like to know if it's a credit-per-assignment type program.

Mostly, I'm imagining this for writing classes. Dealing with adults is a little different than kids, even high school kids, and it certainly changes how much time I can give to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I'm exploring this because I love stories and story games, and I'm wondering if their power can be productively tapped in my classrooms. The goals of the classes are many, complex, and sometimes contradictory, so that's why I'm willing (for now) to be more open-ended about the educational goals. I'm more worried about finding what games can actually be played by total beginners in the limited time frame I'd have. Then I can look at those games to see what, if anything, they can add from an educational side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343739/#Comment_343739" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T10:59:36+00:00" title="September 23, 2011 10:59AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            College writing opens it up a lot more (I had expected middle/high school).  You probably don't want to go too far into genre RPGs (sci-fi, fantasy, etc) because it requires genre knowledge/interest.  Fiasco would be perfect because the variety of playsets allow for a lot of historical/real world settings.  Also, the game lends itself well to PbF so you could probably run a game as a purely writing exercise, completed on Blackboard (or whatever online educational system your college uses) outside of class if you wanted to.  It would be a cool assignment to break students up into tables, have them play, then have each person at the table fictionalize the events of the game through their character's point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343740/#Comment_343740" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T11:04:12+00:00" title="September 23, 2011 11:04AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2011 11:42AM by akooser.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use Shock: Social Science fiction all the time in our college science classroom.

Ok. That explains the fluctuating attendance.<br/><br/>So you need games that will interest non-gamer college-age students. And they need to play fast. And it sounds like if they put language in the spotlight, that would be good, yes?<br/><br/>Check out Og. A game about cavemen with very few words in their vocabulary.<br/><br/>Look into Breaking the Ice. About dating and relationships, which is a favorite subject for most college students. Lots of good material could come out of that for writing assignments. You could have the write the story of the gameplay in more detail, or write what happens next. Or write an analysis of some sort. And I'm pretty sure it plays fast enough to work for your time restraints, though you would want to test it out a bit first and make sure you were well prepped to get them started on it quickly.<br/><br/>And, as mentioned multiple times already, Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple features letter writing as it's primary mechanic. Like I said, all of Solis' rpgs are very language-focused and tend to be quick playing as well.<br/><br/>There's lots of designers on the forum here. They might be willing to be helpful in getting you going for much less than the cost of a full book per student. Plus, for those games I mentioned, you could probably crib together a one-pager version for the students to reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343832/#Comment_343832" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T08:48:32+00:00" title="September 24, 2011  8:48AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm wondering if you are trying to do "a bunch sitting around a table talking a story out" or more of a pure creative writing thing. Or it sounds like it doesn't matter right now to you, and you are just looking around.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple idea of rough designy-ish ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm the middle of playtesting a writing game that a teacher friend has suggested that might work well in a classroom. Essentially, the game is played where a player writes a chapter as if its a journal entried gfy his character, then he provides 5 chapter titles to the next player, who must select one of those to use as inspiration for what happens next to his chareacter. This could be applied pretty easily to having the teacher just write five different chapter names on the blackboard, and the students continue their story by selecting one of them.  But in this case, there probably wouldn't be much interplay amongst students.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor something more "around the table," maybe something like this: setup random groups of people around tables. Each talbe has a stack of cards with usual story/character tidbits. Everyone starts out as a "blank slate" taking turns pulling out tidbits, adding to their own story, with the other players asking questions. Sort of a much looser version of Penny for your Thoughts. Ideally, I'd imagine that it would be interesting if everyon could intermingle as characters from completely different time periods, again, keeping it loose. Thematically, it could something like an Inn at the End of the World, which is a kind of urgatory wheree souls go until someone decides they can move on. Or alternately, something playing the characters throughout time who are being dragged around in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344110/#Comment_344110" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T08:58:30+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  8:58AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see a creative writing class employ Universalis to build fiction through game play and then turn it into written works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344114/#Comment_344114" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-27T09:14:23+00:00" title="September 27, 2011  9:14AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2011 9:16AM by UserClone.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.whereareyourkeys.org" rel="nofollow">Where Are Your Keys?</a></b> is a pretty awesome game to bring into the classroom, I think.<br/>\nAnd yeah, at first, it doesn't feel much like a game, for varying definitions of "game," but I can tell you firsthand that this sonafabitch is FUN.<br/>\nCheck out the (long as hell, but incredibly) instructional video at the bottom of the home page.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Though obviously, right up there with Barnga, it is explicitly NOT a story game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344263/#Comment_344263" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T13:04:41+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  1:04PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe my game <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/the-daughters-of-verona/" rel="nofollow">The Daughters of Verona</a> could be of interest?<br><br>It's a game of Shakespearean comedies, it consists of three equal parts; Shakespeare, theater and RPG.
