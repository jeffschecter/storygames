And very much about how improv has changed your role playing. <br/><br/>Last night, I played In a Wicked Age... with the western Mass group.  I got to play high status to Julia's character.  High is harder for me than low, so it's good to feel out the mannerisms of it. And later in the game, my character ended the episode by having a terrible dream of destruction of his kingdom: and then proceeded to run out into the world and make it so by pissing of his closest ally. This brings up the difference between accepting adversity and accepting low status in a scene. Related but different issues. <br/><br/>best,<br/>Em                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91070/#Comment_91070" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T13:01:59+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  1:01PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 1:05PM by jzn.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the player side, status issues are one good thing about having differently-specialized characters in a group.  It's nice to be the guy who's the best at <i>something</i>, and it doesn't have to ruffle anybody's feathers if it doesn't impede on their special grounds.  We were making Iron Heroes guys the other night and there was a politeness argument about who got to be "the guy with daggers".<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the character side, being able to play status can be a great asset.  Playing the villains' reversal from high to low status when the players climatically defeat them, for instance, can be a more pleasurable reward for the players than even gobs of xp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91496/#Comment_91496" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T23:10:37+00:00" title="August 29, 2007 11:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff, Graham.

This is some of the best reading in my feed trough these days.<br/><br/>Emily: The festival was great! We had about 44 troupes in from around the country, and I wound up getting to watch about twenty of them. It was super sweet to be able to see such a range of styles and talents over the week, and especially nice to hang out with everyone and drink and dance and play and talk shop just after just about every evening's performance. Plus, our all-improviser mini-golf tournament was a huge blast - this was my first year playing, and I will not miss another. My favorite show was on "closing night" (which was actually the second to last night), when some folks from Theatersports LA came up and busted out a mind-blowing 45-minute fully improvised Shakespeare play. Best show I've ever seen, I think. I was inspired.<br/><br/>(Speaking of pimping, if anyone here is interested in coming out next year - to watch or to perform - let me know, and I'll forward you to the proper authorities. It would be great to see the same kind of crossover here as we got a taste of at GenCon...)<br/><br/>Okay, I've got some reading to catch up on over there, and then, firing up the blabber machine...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
