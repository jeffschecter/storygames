You could stick it on a wall if you don\u2019t have enough space on the table.<br/>\uf021\tA packet of colouring pencils; you can use pens or plain pencils instead, but colouring pencils have two advantages. First, you can rub out what you have drawn more easily and second, colour will bring the scene to life.<br/>\uf021\tAn eraser or two (see above)<br/>\uf021\tEnough dice to give three to each player; when \u2018dice\u2019 are referred to in this game, we\u2019re talking about the cube-shaped kind, with six faces numbered 1 to 6. <br/><br/>For a basic game of Doodlerama make the following preparations:<br/>\uf021\tDraw six boxes down the left side of the page and another six down the right side; number the squares in each bar from 1 at the top to 6 at the bottom.<br/>\uf021\tThe boxes down the left side are for Simple Shapes, which are a straight line, a curved line, a right-angle, a circle, a triangle and a square.<br/>\uf021\tThe boxes down the right side are for Special Shapes; each player should take it in turn to draw something in one of these squares. Each shape should be quick to draw and simple for others to copy, but they should not be pictures of anything in particular, just abstract shapes. Draw freely and use whatever comes into your head but don\u2019t focus on it, just follow your pencil. If there are less than six players, then the youngest players get to fill in the blank squares, after everyone has filled in at least one of them.<br/>\uf021\tGive everybody 3 dice, then, starting with the youngest player first, begin to tell the story.<br/><br/>On each player\u2019s turn, they roll all the dice they have and refer to the two bars of Simple &amp; Special Shapes to see what they must draw this turn:<br/>\uf021\tCompare each single die rolled to the Simple Shapes; your doodle must include all those results. For example, if you rolled 3, 5 and 6, you would have to draw a right-angle, a triangle and a square. If you rolled 2, 2 and 4, you would have to draw two curved lines and a circle.<br/>\uf021\tCompare each pair of results to the Special Shapes; your doodle may include any Special Shape you have rolled a pair for, instead of drawing two copies of the Simple Shape that corresponds to that number. For each additional die showing that result after the pair, you may draw that shape once more. <i>For example, if you rolled 2, 2 and 4, then you could draw 2 curved lines and a circle, or draw the second shape in the Special Shapes bar once, with one circle. If you rolled 1, 1 and 1, you could either draw three straight lines, or draw the first shape in the Special bar twice.</i><br/><br/>Whatever you draw is your <i>doodle</i> for this turn and it must include all the shapes you have rolled for, both Simple and Special. All the shapes in the <i>doodle</i> must be part of the same picture: they do not have to touch, but they must all help to define the same \u2018thing\u2019, whatever it is. It\u2019s entirely up to you what you draw, but you will need to describe it to the other players; describing your doodle is a mixture of two important talents, these being imagination and cheek.<br/>\uf021\t<b>Imagination</b> is the ability to put the shapes you have drawn together into a reasonable picture that fits well into the story. The aspect of imagination is about your creativity and artistry, both in drawing and story-telling. <i>For example, if the story so far is set in France and your roll results in one straight line plus two circles, you might draw a passable bicycle and say that the leader of the Tour de France has just ridden into the scene.</i><br/>\uf021\t<b>Cheek</b> is the ability to make less do more or simply to get away with the ridiculous just because it is entertaining. If you are less artistically inclined than other players, you can simply draw as little as possible and explain away the missing parts of your doodle using cheek. <i>For example, if you roll three circles, you could simply draw them separately on the page and say they are the footprints of a Polar bear in the snow; if anyone asks you where the fourth leg is, just say it\u2019s only standing on three of them while it scratches its nose!</i><br/><br/>You can also use your results to modify any doodle that already exists on the page, adding further detail or even obscuring things that have already been drawn, though in the advanced game, you may be challenged to a Pencil Duel when you do this. If you are truly stumped and can\u2019t think of anything to draw, you must still draw your shapes on the page, but you don\u2019t have to say anything about them; if you do this, pass one of your dice over to the next player, who adds it to their own dice pool.<br/>\tWhen describing your doodle, you also have to add it into the ongoing narrative; as players take turns, the story the scene depicts will grow and expand, going in whatever direction the players decide. There is no limit on what any player can bring into the story or how they can change things, this is a freeform story-telling game and no-one can veto what anyone else does on their turn. This means the only way to affect what happens in the story is your ability to draw and narrate what you like on your own turn. Beyond this, the game is intended as a fun activity: there is no goal to pursue and definitely no winners or losers . It\u2019s an opportunity for everyone taking part to exercise their imaginations, their drawing skills and their oration, without judgement or censure. Just enjoy it and got with the flow. If your playsheet fills up, call and end to that scene and move on to a new one, either continuing that story or starting afresh.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276653/#Comment_276653" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T13:00:50+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  1:00PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very cute!<br/><br/>A storytelling variation on Pictionary, or something similar, is what it sounds like to me.

An even easier alternative that works well with younger kids is to ignore the dice-losing rules altogether and just play for the fun of it.<br/><br/>It's a very flexible little story-telling tool, rather than a complete game in this version, and you can either play it with the firm aim in mind of telling a story, or just have everyone make up random stuff on their turn for a laugh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276753/#Comment_276753" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T06:40:52+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  6:40AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's neat.

Two players.<br/><br/>I started by saying I had a way to continue the story (that we had up to that point just been talking about) by using pictures and taking turns. I drew 6 boxes down the left and right sides of the paper (oriented landscape) and drew in the simple shapes on the left. I explained that we would make up new shapes for the right side, and drew in a set of wavy lines in the top right box as an example. The kid drew a rectangle in the next one. Having forgotten your recommendation to keep it abstract, I drew a star in the third. He drew a half circle in the fourth. I drew a lightning bolt shape in the fifth, and he drew a pair of lines at an acute angle in the sixth. At that point I said that the boxes on the right were supposed to be special, and suggested he embellish the shapes he drew. He asked me for help with that, so I added a curve to the half circle to make it a crescent shape, and a line to the bottom shape to make it an arrow.<br/><br/>Then I explained the rules for rolling dice and choosing shapes.<br/><br/>Play proceeded as we cooperatively tried to depict the scene in the story, frequently taking each others' suggestions about how to best use the shapes to accomplish that. We stopped when we agreed that it was done.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/Top-1.jpg"/><br/><br/>It's an elf (at the bottom) fighting a monster!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276877/#Comment_276877" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-19T03:05:38+00:00" title="June 19, 2010  3:05AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, we quite often don't use abstract shapes in the right-hand bar and a lightning bolt is one of the kid's favourites here when we play the game; the others they often want are love hearts, Pacman and sea-waves.<br/><br/>Your game was full of win and I like how you established a story before you began drawing; I'll suggest that when I play this with the kids at work next, maybe we'll try doing a Doodlerama version of Little Red Riding Hood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dragonkev" title="dragonkev"><img alt="dragonkev" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dragonkev">dragonkev</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276899/#Comment_276899" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-19T13:07:29+00:00" title="June 19, 2010  1:07PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi James<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm liking this, it may be something I could try out with some of my pre-school children, I may have to help or do doodles for some of them (as Aumpa has done above) but it would be a great opportunity for developing imaginative play, and even if they want me to do the doodling it wouldn't impact their input and ideas into play.
