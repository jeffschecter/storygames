Most of what happened was my fault. I drifted things. I am not always the world's best * World MC.<br/><br/>None of my comments below should be read as criticism of Gregor, btw.<br/><br/><b>Some Background</b><br/><br/>I ran this for my Tuesday night meetup. We have a core of regulars which changes slowly over time. However, for any given week there's no guarantee that all the people in a given game will  be there.<br/><br/>Before running the game, I read the <i>Laexdaela Saga</i>, <i>Njal's Saga</i>, and <i>Viking Age Iceland</i> by Jesse Byock.<br/><br/><b>The Campaign, At First</b><br/><br/>We used Jason Morningstar's playbooks. Those omit The Man, which I was fine with, as it is fairly fiddly and also not really in the spirit of the kind of game I was hoping to run, which was more or less something like <i>Njal's Saga</i>. One of my players had read that saga, and he made a Huscarl named Gunnar, explicitly modeled on the character of the same name in the saga. (Gunnar didn't have a liege, as I was trying to model the kind of rich freeman in the sagas.) He was friends with Ulf the Gothi, and in love with Sigrid/Saorise, Ulf's thrall. The PCs were rounded out by Thorkel the Godless, a Wanderer (in time we would learn he was a Christian priest.) So far so good.<br/><br/>Ulf had an enemy, Koll the Serpent-tongued. Thorkel started out staying with him, and remained in a somewhat ambiguous relationship between Ulf and Koll most of the early going.<br/><br/>The early game revolved around the conflict between Koll and Ulf, which escalated several times to violence. Some cracks began to show immediately--Gunnar's player tended to not choose "your actions are honourable and admirable" choice when we used Accept a Physical Challenge to represent combat, but a lot of the time he was alone or only with the enemies of Ulf, so I felt somewhat at a loss for how to bring those consequences home realistically.<br/><br/>I wasn't using Fronts. That was probably a mistake, but I didn't like the choices I had on the Front categories. Of course, I should have realized I was drifting the game, but so far we were all mostly having fun.<br/><br/>Combat remained an issue, however. How Grave was Grave Harm? Could you fight on? Sure, I usually called for Tempt Fate when they did...but it still seemed like I was doing way more interpretation of the results than I did running DW.<br/><br/><b>The Campaign, Foundering</b><br/><br/>We had some personnel changes. Ulf died, and his player started running a different game. Some new people showed up, and the conflict between player characters escalated. Gunnar married Saorise, who switched to the Woman playbook. Gunnar converted to Christianity, and our new Seithkona made it her task to try and stop the Christianization of Iceland. Ulf's brother Jorund (a NPC) died and his son Bjorn (another NPC) turned to lawsuits to keep up a feud with Gunnar.<br/><br/>As the PvP increased, the seams began to really show, because a lot of the time I was the one in charge of calling the move for when combat happened, and trying to interpret the results. Without a harm clock, it was difficult to see exactly when a combat should end. It didn't seem fair that, say, one PC could simply Accept a Physical Challenge and that would be the entire combat without another PC getting a move. Probably I needed more experience with AW style combat...but still. It seemed that moves targeting other PCs had a lot of issues.<br/><br/>Other moves became problematic. Gunnar's Confidante move boxed me in a lot--when he used it on an NPC who didn't have a bond on him and got a 10+, I'd have no choice but to have the NPC do what he wanted. Sure, I could have followed the fiction and said, No way he does that, but that felt like nerfing the player as well as putting me in the spotlight as the move-arbiter. We had an incident of bad feeling when the Shield-Maiden--played by Ulf's player--Goaded Bjorn to attack some Christians led by Thorkel who had massacred some pagans during Thing. I had played Bjorn as cool and calculating beyond his years; it was unlikely he would charge a heavily armed camp on the words of one of his enemies. But again, here I was, with my choices being to nerf the move (which I did, ultimately; Bjorn didn't attack, but walked in and arrested Thorkel), not allow it at all (which I didn't have great ground to do, since the conditions of the trigger had been met), or put something that was wildly inconsistent into the fiction.<br/><br/>The campaign finally fell apart when I, in an attempt to pull everything into some kind of direction, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwV569qKjztjJZ9c_KKNoz5D1CvxDEWbkDXEI10E-A/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">made some Vinland</a> moves and the PCs went on an expedition to Vinland. The Shield-Maiden started a war with the Skraelings, Gunnar and his son Ref (both PCs) tried to kill her before she could board the boat, and I used my Fate Bonds with the SM to have her pass her Grave Harm move. Everyone walked away dissatisfied, and when one of the players emailed me to say he was going to quit not only the game but the meetup, I pulled the plug.<br/><br/><b>What I Did Wrong</b><br/><br/>I didn't use Fronts, and I didn't enforce a lot of scarcity. Those were the biggest mistakes, as it drifted the game. I was less interested in using scarcities because I was trying to go for the feel of the sagas, which don't often get into issues of running out of food or money (in normal conditions), but I could have done more with them than I did.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I drifted the game.<br/><br/><b>What I Saw As Problems</b><br/><br/>Mostly, it was the move triggers.<br/><br/>AW, Monsterhearts, Monster of the Week...even Dungeon World...have pretty good move triggers. The situations they apply to are obvious, more or less. <br/><br/>The move triggers in Sagas are...less well formed. For example, Goad a Man to Action has no trigger other than the move name. There's no restriction. As written, you could force your worst enemy to...I don't know, murder his firstborn child. Sure, that's ridiculous. Sure, you can head that off in the fiction. But grey areas.<br/><br/>Confidante likewise was problematic: <b>When you tell them what you think, whether they want to hear it or not.</b> From the context of the playbook, I'm pretty sure that this was meant to be the loyal retainer giving advice to his liege, or other people, but as written it had the same issues.<br/><br/>For comparison, here's the text of the Manipulate Someone move in Monsterhearts:<br/><br/><i>\u2022 On a 10 up, they\u2019ll do what you want if you give them a bribe, a threat, or a motive. <br/>\u2022 On a 7-9, the MC will tell you what it\u2019ll take to get the NPC to do what you want. Do it and they will.</i><br/><br/>...which is so much a better description of how this works in the Sagas, <i>as well as containing a real limitation</i>, that if I run Sagas again I'm going to make that the text of the move.<br/><br/>The other huge issue was PvP.  What threw me was how much combat between PCs relies on the MC to interpret it. Since there's no Harm clock, it's up to the MC to decide just how bad things are, whether or not a PC can return to the fight, etc. Other World games tend to have some neutral arbiter in the rules.<br/><br/>Of course, I probably messed that up, like I messed up other parts of the game. It recently occurred to me that one way to untie the Gordian knot would be to flatly make the default PvP combat move a simultaneous Tempt Fate. (Have a high Young? Good, you'll make your Grave Harm move then.) I floated this to some of the people from this campaign, and they were non-committal about that idea.<br/><br/><b>In Conclusion</b><br/><br/>I really like Sagas. I <i>want</i> to like it more. I want to run it better. I know a lot of people love it very well. So, I'm looking for advice: what did I do wrong, how can I do it better.<br/><br/>So help me, if you can, figure this out better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447486/#Comment_447486" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T18:06:03+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  6:06PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 6:07PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry it didn't go well.

I think your self-analysis is probably pretty accurate. <br/><br/>Not explicitly tying them quite closely together in a web of kinship is a bad plan.<br/></blockquote>\nThe post was a monster, so I didn't get too much into the actual relations between the characters, but they were in a tight bond of kinship, actually. Ref started off as Ulf's brother's foster-son, and was eventually discovered to actually be Gunnar's son by Ulf's wife Bera (an unfortunate pre-campaign encounter). Bera generally belittled the older Ulf in favor of Gunnar, and ultimately betrayed Ulf when Koll's forces attacked.<br/><br/>There were times when there were no witnesses to Gunnar's dishonor--specifically, an ambush by some of Koll's family (Gunnar killed Koll during the attack which killed Ulf). Now, maybe in that circumstance I shouldn't have allowed the Accept a Challenge move. But what else? Tempt Fate? That's probably the best way to go...but it doesn't <i>feel</i> like a combat move all the time.\n<blockquote><br/>Move fictional triggers only trip when they should trip.

If a badass wants to attack a weakling, <i>the weakling is going to be killed.</i> Combat should end as soon as it starts.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nSo, here's the thing with both of those. Because the triggers are written so broadly, a lot of the time I'm going to end up being the sole arbiter of whether or not they trigger. (Obviously, I'll take a table consensus, but a lot of the time it's going to be my call.) That feels...odd for a *World game, and it's not an issue in the other *World games I've run, like MotW, or Dungeon World.<br/><br/>I mean, the thing is, Avery's Monsterhearts move completely avoids that problem and doesn't make the triggering dependent on the MC's feel of the fictional situation. And ironically feels a lot more like the kind of things that happen in the Sagas--after all, Gudrun's famous goading of her sons involves a <i>threat</i> (to their honor--she says they should have been born as women if they're not going to avenge their father.)<br/><br/>With combat, most of it comes down to the omission of a harm clock, or moves that can act as a neutral arbiter between the contending parties. I mean, sure, I can declare "you both take grave harm, move on." Probably I should! But...I dunno. I'm somewhat resistant to that kind of arbitrary decision-making. Not sure why...but I generally <i>don't</i> have that conflict with other *World games, so I'm looking for why.<br/><br/>(That said, I'm assuredly going to take your advice on it, with maybe an Accept a Challenge move by one of the parties if a "winner" is necessary. But it still leaves some areas ambiguous...that don't happen in, say, AW, which has moves for "do what I want or I hurt you" or "I'm taking your thing, and you're gonna hurt.")<br/><br/>This kind of thing of course doesn't happen in AW, or MotW. I'm not called upon to be arbitrary about the circumstances. Of course, I can do so here--for example, a table rule about combat always involving Grave Harm, or my own idea of always calling for Tempt Fate during PvP. <br/><br/>I think bottom line if I was supposed to treat combat like that, shouldn't it have been a Principle? <br/><br/>Moreover, exactly how much PvP is supposed to happen in SotI seems somewhat ambiguous. AW isn't ambiguous; it's clear as soon as you look at the common moves that PCs are going to fight or at least push on each other. Likewise, MotW makes it pretty clear that PvP isn't a focus, as does DW. SotI...occupies a kind of in between place, where it's implied, but there's not a lot of mechanical support for the direction it's supposed to take.\n<blockquote><br/><br/>If a player is choosing not to have their character act with honor, that has consequences that can be far ranging.

Family turns their back, wives divorce them. Move time forward three months (there's a move for that) and the landscape has changed. <br/><br/>Just some thoughts.<br/></blockquote>\nYah, those are pretty good, and I did try to make stuff like that happen--Gunnar got sued a bunch of times, I told him people wouldn't trust him as much...but it was hard to get it to stick. That's almost assuredly a group dynamic thing, and maybe me not bringing the hammer as hard as I could. (I mean heck, I could drop down a "you lost a lawsuit at Thing this summer, here's the consequences...")<br/><br/>I dunno. Like I said, a group dynamic thing, but also a fiction &amp; Principles issue--I mean, the players wanted to defend those lawsuits, and so that all happened.<br/><br/>Looking back, the obvious thing to do was to say, "What dishonorable thing do you do?" and then if the player had nothing to say, deny the choice. That seems well within the Principles et al, so going forward that's what I'll do. <br/><br/>I guess what bothered me is that I seemed a lot of the time to be pulled out of the MC role and pushed into a more traditional GM role, and that felt awkward. When I GM Gumshoe, I don't have problems like this; when I've MC'ed other World games, I've not felt that same awkwardness.<br/><br/>I think--and this is really, really my personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt--there's an unresolved tension in SotI between the theoretical source material--the Icelandic Sagas--and the more grounded reality that the actual rules introduce. The Sagas characters are just ever so slightly larger than life, and the Sagas chronicle the important (violent!) parts of their life, not the minutiae of how many goats are in the upper meadow this year. (I believe you are broadly in sympathy with me on that subject, Jason <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ) <br/><br/>(There's also a secondary tension between the idea of the Commonwealth as a ideal anarchist state and the reality that it was also a place where you could literally be killed for saying the wrong thing.)<br/><br/>So I wanted to go on record about this stuff, even if I'm the only audience <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> because after all, there's at least one person who couldn't get this from a straight reading of the rules, and I don't think it's because I'm a general failure at reading comprehension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447490/#Comment_447490" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T19:01:02+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  7:01PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>Move fictional triggers only trip when they should trip.
