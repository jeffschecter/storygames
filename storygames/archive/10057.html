Yikes. Anyway, to get past some weird forum inconsistencies, I had to reset the global styles for everyone back to "Jazzman" (the one with the black border and the green tabs). Feel free to change it to whatever you had before under "Account ---&gt; Change Stylesheet".<br/><br/>Note: I'll be upgrading Vanilla soon to 1.7-1.8, so that might cause you to do the same thing again. Most of the time, there's no resulting problems, but sometimes 1-2 styles go Bonk. That upgrade will happen within the next 1-2 weeks.<br/><br/>Today (Friday), if you see any other inconsistencies or problems, please let me know.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
