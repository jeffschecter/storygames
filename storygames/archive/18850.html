It all started when the players in my three-years-running-post-apocalyptic-BRP-campaign put themselves into a TPK situation and died. (Being locked into an old cargo container with a giant berserk fire-breathing mutant mammoth and then provoking said gentleman can have that effect.)<br/><br/>Instead of just making new characters we decided to take a break and try out something different. By chance I found a wonderful Swedish cyberpunk game called \u201c<i>Teknochock</i>\u201d. It was by no way a masterpiece but it opened my eyes to how nice a game can be to the gamemaster. Instead of the useless statblocks littering BRP clones every single NPC in Teknochock had the same stats. Exactly the same stats.<br/><br/>Ah, no more riffling through the papers to find robber no4!<br/><br/>The system was wonky though so we quit after a while but this simplicity was refreshing. Before it had always seemed to my limited experience that every RPG I read was either simulationist or freeform, either detailed rules or hand waving.<br/><br/>Then a got a tip about a very special game called <i>Apocalypse World</i>. You know, where the murder-hobos have reasons to interact with each other? We tried it and we loved it, even though certain parts were really hard for me as MC to connect with. ("I don\u2019t get to roll any dice?") The best part was skipping the binary succeed/fail by adding succeed but\u2026<br/><br/>This got me working on an Apocalypse World hack of <i>Deathwatch</i>. A game that is a boring simulationist-fest with a wonderful, over-the-top, grimdark setting. However, even though it\u2019s like they fit together like a hand in glove, it\u2019s hard work to make playbooks and to try to balance them against each other. Also, the MC doesn\u2019t get to roll any dice and there are a lot of special rules for everything thanks to the playbook moves.<br/><br/>As I never feel really relaxed as GM if I don\u2019t have all the rules handy I needed a simpler system. I started to make one around the core operation of Apocalypse World: roll 2D6 add/subtract stuff and compare: -6: fail 7-9: succeed, but\u2026 10+ succeed.<br/><br/>Then I found <i>Cthulhu Dark</i>, which was even simpler. And in this thread: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17271/cthulhu-dark-hacking-insanity-for-other-themesgenresgames" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17271/cthulhu-dark-hacking-insanity-for-other-themesgenresgames</a> people were talking about hacking Cthulhu Dark. Especially AMBayard\u2019s Overdeath Megakill hack sparked my imagination. Maybe because it was hardly a Dark Cthulhu hack at all. There\u2019s no inherent drawback or danger in leveling up as compared to going insane.<br/><br/><b>Claim</b><br/>Hence <a href="http://levelupordietrying.wordpress.com/downloads/" rel="nofollow">Level up or Die Trying</a>. The main idea is to have a fantasy rpg system where focus is on the action without the entire game stalling as soon as someone draws a sword. But still I like to use dice for resolution so it\u2019s not simply storytelling taking turns.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve tried it one session and we had a blast so now I\u2019m looking for feedback. <br/><br/><b>Questions</b><br/>The text is pretty limited to fit on two sides of a single paper, and a lot is implied rather than expounded. Should I expand it?<br/><br/>Has it already been done? I\u2019m not too versed in indie games but it seems something this simple must already have been done.<br/><br/>Should I simply play Munchkin instead?<br/><br/>Please have a look and tell me what you think: <br/><br/><b>TL;DNR</b><br/>New game: <a href="http://levelupordietrying.wordpress.com/downloads/" rel="nofollow">Level up or Die Trying</a><br/>Feedback please<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422433/#Comment_422433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T14:47:30+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  2:47PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please expand it, try to explain things more like a procedure (first you will need Xd6 and X and Y, create your character like this, gm makes prep this way, apply these principles to play the game because when played it should look like this, and here's a list of ideas for cliches that worked for us)<br/><br/>Also, I'd either add a random table to create npcs, monsters, items and places or plain use<a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow"> this.</a> And for pete's eye sake, don't use gothic fonts, that dam thing hurts my eyes! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> good luck with it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422442/#Comment_422442" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T21:16:26+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  9:16PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's amusing, I liked it on a brief skim through the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422881/#Comment_422881" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T04:45:05+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  4:45AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, but Gothic fonts are so lovely Warrior monk.<br/><br/>I've playtested it with two different groups yielding totally different results. So I should probably just call it a playtestdocument or something.<br/><br/>One of the core changes is a variable difficulty setting:<br/><b>Normal</b>=When fighting as a group everybody roll their dice only the highest counts.<br/><b>Hard</b>=When fighting as a group everybody roll their dice and compare individually, some will lay down the hurt and some will simply be hurt.<br/><b>Insane</b>=When fighting as a group everybody roll their dice and compare individually, some will lay down the hurt and some will simply be hurt. There is no Harm pool. Any beast roll of 6 simply kills.<br/><br/>I've also realized that brevity does not equal simplicity. So I'll probably expand the text with processes, design thoughts and examples.<br/><br/>And then I'll hack it. <br/><br/>I am going to try out the star wars hack tomorrow. Tentatively named: <i>Level up or don't. There is no trying</i> alluding to an old Yoda quote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
