I've taken a different approach than the usual of generic playbooks.<br/>The game will be (probably) called <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/blademoon/download/BladeMoon-v01-Playbooks.pdf" rel="nofollow">"The Blade and the Moon"</a>, and will contain a little tuning of the basic AW system (i.e. adding Chains that work similarly to Monsterhearts' strings, and Tags that are similar to Fate aspects). Other than that, the system will be pretty much a vanilla AW.<br/><br/>But what I like the most about this project, is that it comes with a little, pre-generated and very focused setting. There are a few locations and setting elements (i.e. a village and a bridge to the north, a broken hill with an ancient burial site, woods with savage tribes, a White Tree deep in the woods, the ruins of a dark castle on the top of an unnatural rocky spike in the middle of the fields..).<br/>Every playbook contains a few starting Bonds to select from, at the start; and besides bonds with other characters, there will be bonds to the people/locations/duties/icons etc. tied strictly to the setting. There's no pre-determined content or adventure, just a powerful quick-start, that should give the game a boost from the start.<br/><a href="http://www.daimongames.com/blademoon/download/BladeMoon-v01-Playbooks.pdf" rel="nofollow">If you'd like, check out the playbooks here: http://www.daimongames.com/blademoon/download/BladeMoon-v01-Playbooks.pdf</a><br/><br/>I'm summoning <a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">@horn_head_o</a> that expressed some interest already: I'm totally open to feedback - and I hope to have soon something more to share.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445286/#Comment_445286" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-21T04:44:26+00:00" title="May 21, 2015  4:44AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I *love* the ideas and evocative-ness of a lot of it. It also does some <i>really</i> great things for condensing space on the playbook (multiple boxes for "A new X move" rather than multiple lines that all say that? I think I might have to take that...)<br/><br/>The first thing to jump out at me as weird is the enormous list of Looks. I think a big set of things like that is a bit excessive. Aside from the fact that "as many as you need" doesn't specify that it's only one per list (which may be intentional, but is a departure from the norm), it's generally helpful to just list the things that are relevant to an archetype. All of them have gender/eyes/hair/face/body/outlook, which overlooks a place for making the playbooks unique relative to each other. It says something when the only person whose hair matters is, say, The Animist.<br/>The other thing is a giant pile of text like that is an intimidation factor to newcomers, even if it's not a big deal. That's what I like about the Monsterhearts skin layout relative to the Dungeon World character sheet - the text density of the latter makes it seem like a lot more to take in, even though the systems have a comparable level of complexity.<br/><br/>I've played the "mixing Harm and Tags" game before, and rapidly came to the conclusion that it's often just nicer to handle it all with tags! Me and many of the people I've played with usually find that pure numerical harm is often one of the weaker spots in ApW hacks. What does solid numerical harm do for your game?<br/>Oh, and the bubbles next to the harm values look like zeroes. For a second I was wondering why the mismatch between 3-harm weapons and 10 and 20 harm healing fast and needing 70 to die.<br/><br/>This next thing is me philosophizing a bit, but I have opinions about stat names. For me, one of the things that separates ApW from a lot of the crowd of traditional games is that its stats describe personality, not capability, which is why stat substitution can make sense so easily. That's one of those things that I look for in hacks, stats, adjective stats (Cool, Dark, Hot, Gendered, Weird, Solid, etc). Now, what you have are clearly personality-describing, but it's unclear what each element necessarily brings to the table. This will be more clear once we see the basic moves, but I find it's a little easier if the stats' nature is more clear from the names. Especially when <i>Deal With Danger</i> can use any stat depending on the context (as I'm intuiting from the basic move upgrades, and I'm kinda assuming it's like Defy Danger), it's especially important that the stats tell you what they mean.<br/>(I have some qualms about mixing personality stats and the Defy Danger multi-stat idea, but I don't think they're relevant to bring up yet)<br/>Side note: I too had elemental stats originally for my game! Air, Fire, Earth, Water, Spirit originally.<br/><br/>I didn't get a sexy vibe from the concepts in the playbooks - is sex enough of a factor of the game that Sex Moves are an important element? If so, should relationships and interpersonal stuff be more present in the moves? Because I can certainly imagine how archetype would change one's approach to it.<br/><br/>You might think about separating out the gang moves into their own section of each playbook, they make the move lists look giant (esp. on the Guardian)  even though a bunch of the moves are sub-moves for the leadership thing. I'm also really curious about how you'll handle gangs, as I think that's often the most complex or unclear element of a lot of PbtA games. <br/><br/>The Veteran and the Guardian both have literally no playbook moves that are meant for outside combat, while the other two have quite little unique to do in combat. While it's important for the first two to be good in combat, it seems like there are interesting things their archetype does out of combat as well. As it stands, focus will shift between the characters depending on whether or not you're in combat or not, with Animists and Shadows' Masters having a lot to do out of combat and the Veterans and Guardians being the focal point of combat. Do you want this dynamic? Of course, the basic moves will prevent anyone from being totally excluded.<br/><br/>What exactly is the difference between the Guardian and the Veteran? All of the Guardian moves look like they'd be at home on the Veteran, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Hopefully these give you something to think about! I'm really excited to get my hands on the full beta.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445288/#Comment_445288" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-21T08:47:24+00:00" title="May 21, 2015  8:47AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks!<br/>This is a lot of feedback - and it's really spot-on and tremendously helpful! Especially since you didn't even see the basic moves etc. but your guesses are correct.<br/>Now I just need to figure out how much barter it would take me to take you aboard and do this thing with me.\n<blockquote>multiple boxes for "A new X move"</blockquote>\nPlease do take it; it's the same I've done in City of Judas (another AW-hack of mine) where the playbooks were quite dense and I needed to condense things even further.\n<blockquote>Looks</blockquote>\nYou're right: I'll revise that. Too much stuff.\n<blockquote>giant pile of text ... Monsterhearts skin layout</blockquote>\nYes, 100 times yes... I have a couple of ideas of where to cleanup...<br/>But it won't be like Monsterhearts (as much as I'd like to...); I've got only so much that I can chop away before I get to the very meaningful stuff.\n<blockquote>bubbles next to the harm values look like zeroes</blockquote>\nThanks, will fix!\n<blockquote>What does solid numerical harm do for your game</blockquote>\nI like tags/consequences in Fate style. In this game, though, I am not sure I want to step away - not just yet - from the pure numerical counter. Not completely.<br/>It might be, in a new review. But I had some concerns about introducing a completely different harm system from the start.<br/>Players seem to be comfortable playing with what they know and having to deal with few changes only. In City of Judas I used a different harm system - it works fine but takes a bit to fully grasp and sometimes made people uncomfortable (they felt like they didn't know how bad they were hurt, exactly).\n<blockquote>opinions about stat names</blockquote>\nLet's see after we see the basic moves etc.\n<blockquote>is sex enough of a factor of the game [...] relationships and interpersonal stuff be more present in the moves</blockquote>\nSex is a factor. Probably not as strong as in AW, but it should be.<br/>I've found that most of my players take the game slightly more seriously when sex is involved: it's a great hook for social tension, drama, and intrigue.<br/>In my last Monsterhearts game - well, of course the focus on sex and attraction is much stronger there - I had only one player actively trying to have sex with others. But everybody at the table felt that, and the game-play that emerged was definitely influenced by it.<br/>I see the Blade and the Moon as a back-and-forth between a dark DW and a MH game: the DW-part should take care of the adventure and the fantastic, the MH-part of the intrigue and drama.<br/>Sometimes, just the fact that the possibility of sex is there, is enough to influence the players. They might never get to use the move, but it creates a certain predisposition to a certain play-style.<br/><br/>There's a focus on the relationships and interpersonal stuff in terms of Chains (like MH's strings).<br/>You don't see it much in the playbooks but there's a lot of basic moves that make use of Chains for numerical bonus - even without spending them (sort of rolling with Hx).\n<blockquote>gang moves into their own section</blockquote>\nYes, it sounds good! I might move it after the basic moves upgrades, and keep the columns more balanced between left and right.\n<blockquote>how you'll handle gangs</blockquote>\nVery much like AW for now.\n<blockquote>Veteran and the Guardian</blockquote>\nDiscussion postponed :-)<br/><br/>Let me put some order in the playbooks; your suggestions are very, very helpful and I want to move ahead step by step.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445296/#Comment_445296" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-21T18:46:09+00:00" title="May 21, 2015  6:46PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a 1.1<br/><a href="http://www.daimongames.com/blademoon/download/BladeMoon-v01.1-Playbooks.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.daimongames.com/blademoon/download/BladeMoon-v01.1-Playbooks.pdf</a><br/><br/>I hope to have time tomorrow to review the more meaty stuff like the roles of the Veteran and Guardian! <br/><br/>Changes<br/>- Sex move moved where it's more visible, before the Stats<br/>- Fixed the harm with boxes instead of circles (that looked like zeros, yeah)<br/>- Name and looks moved to the front<br/>- Tuned the gear and other moves and chains sections (they're now looking similar on all the playbooks)<br/>- Reduced the number of options for the looks: I might remove more but I couldn't bring myself to completely remove a line for each (i.e. saying Hair don't matter for the Veteran).

I believe the best part of the veteran will be either in finding the proper allies among the other characters, or going alone against others, trusting the power of that blade itself.<br/>We're going to playtest this with my group in a month or so, so I'll know more if my plan works or not - we need to complete a City of Judas campaign first... I'm eager to switch but my players have some dark demon with a hood coming up in their dreams and want to get rid of the thing before we move on :-) <br/><br/>Guardian: it's a different type of warrior, yes.<br/>It is true, as you said, that "All of the Guardian moves look like they'd be at home on the Veteran, and vice versa".<br/>What makes a big difference is their place in fiction: the Veteran is mostly about conquering something while the Guardian is about protecting. They fit two different play styles, in my opinion: the Veteran as a 'neutral' egoist figure and the Guardian as a 'good'/'lawful' sort of paladin. It's a bit of an experiment, here.<br/>Building a play-style into the playbook - also because of their role in fiction - rather than leaving all that only to emerge in play. I'm not claiming it's the best or wisest choice, but I hope (again after playtesting) to gain some insights from this.<br/><br/>Now: this will probably make more sense when there will be like 6 or 7 playbooks to choose from, rather than four.<br/>It will be easier to have groups with only the Veteran or only the Guardian, but even if both are in play, I am not concerned about niche-protection.<br/>They're not bound to clash and fight every time, but there's a good change they'll start most of the games with the potential for some conflict - and having them on almost equal ground I hope would turn into some interesting games. Probably the key will be how do they secure the help of others, at that point.<br/><br/>Finally: there's always the possibility to steer away from purely fighting by picking moves from other playbooks.<br/><br/>Of course, if you have suggestions on some cool alternatives, possible different moves, etc. that you'd like me to try, feel free to suggest. I might use them in the Veteran or Guardian playbook, or in some new playbook.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Something that I guess it's important: I guess it will be very unlikely to have a party-of-4 all united against some common enemy.<br/>We're going to see conflict between characters, almost for sure. Givan also the 'little' space around the characters (all the meaningful locations are within a day-travel), the action will remain concentrated in one place. Playbooks like the Shadows' Master and the Animist, therefore, will probably try to secure the help of one or both of the Veteran and the Guardian, and the Shadows' Master and the Animist will bring the other dimension into the game.<br/><br/>I don't see the "split" with Veteran/Guardian active when there is combat, and the Shadows' Master and the Animist when there is not, as the basic tune of the game.<br/>Instead, I see the Shadows' Master/Animist dragging the Veteran/Guardian into situations where combat is not the main factor; and vice versa, the Veteran/Guardian using their weapons as a way to balance the other characters' strengths.<br/>But again, this is my "theory"... we'll know better after we play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
