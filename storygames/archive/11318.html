"Disputes About Art." <b>The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 54</b>(2), 153-163</cite>To some of us, the claim that role-playing games might properly be considered works of art seems an impertinence. We point to the melodramatic settings of such games, to the juvenile exploitation of horror and suspense that characterize them, and conclude that in view of this, they cannot possibly be art. Of themselves, however, melodrama, horror, and violence cannot disqualify role-playing games from being works of art. . . . Suppose that instead of <i>Shadowrun</i>, we decide to develop and play a role-playing game based on Jane Austen's <i>Persuasion</i>; a game of morals and manners that is sophisticated and, at its best, profound.<br/><br/>Even so, and despite its sophistication and its similarities to the novel, this role-playing game is unlikely ever to be played, and (as a result) is unlikely ever to be regarded as a work of art. In order to play it, adults would require a considerable amount of time; they would have to devise and remember a vast number of rules, and they would would have to bear in mind all of the complex, emotionally charged details of the game--something that would tax the intellectual energy of even the most imaginative, experienced, and sensitive players.</blockquote>\nThe existence of an Austen-esque RPG doesn't <i>necessarily</i> invalidate the point Novitz is trying to get to--which is that role-playing games fulfill a need in the lives of their mostly adolescent male players having to do with the creation of "a space beyond the reach of adult condemnation" within which can be experienced "a sense of independence, freedom, and spontaneity" otherwise inaccessible--but if there were such a game, it wouldn't help him. Now, there is at least one <a href="http://prideprejudice.proboards.com/index.cgi" rel="nofollow">Pride and Prejudice RPG site</a>, although it's a Regency Era shared-world forum and not a tabletop game per se. Interestingly, its participants seem mostly to be women, as some of the rules of the forum seem to imply:\n<blockquote><cite>Pride and Prejudice forum administrator Paige Hyde says</cite>-For every female character you must have a male character. Try to have them a mix of social classes as well. Who wants a board with a ton of rich girls?!<br/><br/>-Please do not change the color of your posts. It's okay if you want your character to always speak in pink but don't make the whole post pink.</blockquote>\nBut is there a tabletop game based on the work of Jane Austen?

I've thought about these questions a fair bit, and I hope the following jumble of thoughts makes sense:<br/><br/>As JayWalt says, I got involved in StoryGaming a few years back when I set about creating a Jane Austen RPG. Curiously, my point of departure was very much that of David Novitz: I was supposing the existence of a Jane Austen RPG as a thought experiment while trying to make a point. The coincidence is suggestive: there's something about Jane Austen's fictions which makes them seem like an appropriate opposite to pulp adventures. Unlike Dr. No, though, my thought process led me to actually try to craft such a game.<br/><br/>My first attempt was so horribly inflected by D&amp;D assumptions as to be laughable in retrospect: skill lists, skill contests, etc. Since that time I've learned a lot by reading and playing stuff created in the early 2000s, like The Mountain Witch, Trollbabe, and Primetime Adventures. By far my favorite indie game writer is Vincent Baker. The game reports from DitV and Poison'd strike me as the perfect riposte to David Novitz's claim that rpgs cannot attain to art.<br/><br/>This said, there's no question that these games place a considerable burden on the players, who must attain to a certain mastery of the material if they are to successfully enact a fiction appropriate to genre expectations. You can't play out a noir game if several of your players are unfamiliar with the requisite conventions. And this is a significant barrier to the development and play of an Austen game: I've yet to find a group to playtest that's sufficiently familiar with her work. "Why do I want to get an invitation to the ball, now?"<br/><br/>And yet I think David Novitz overstates the importance of period detail. Details only matter insofar as the group decides that they matter. I wonder whether the enactment of an rpg fiction is a collaborative effort best compared to improv comedy or jazz. The players need to play together often and learn to trust one another. And, when they get it all just right the show's a hit, but the players are the only audience.<br/><br/>A number of you have mentioned Philippe Tromeur's rpg of Wuthering Heights. It has always struck me as a parody of the Romantic Novel, rather than an earnest enactment of it. Throwing dice and consulting a table to find out your persona rather undercuts the dignity of the Romantic claim of selfhood. Contrast the earnestness of Vince Baker's character creation in Dogs, where you're encouraged to create traits for your character based on what "Pa" used to say. I mention this not to suggest that Tromeur's game isn't good (I've not played it, so I'm not sure), but rather to question whether it can be considered as an enactment of the Romantic novel\u2014a parody isn't an enactment but rather a way of generating laughter at the thought of seriously enacting.<br/><br/>As to how one might create a Jane Austen rpg, Bill White suggests a "relationship map": that's an approach I've been considering. Jane Austen's characters focus intensely on their status in a highly fluid hierarchy. So actually tracking characters' status on some sort of board would force players to focus on the issue that their characters are supposed to be focused on. Yet the folks over at the Forge will warn of the danger of "trampling the game's fruitful void": when you create a mechanic you reduce it to numbers. If the game is about loyalty, don't create a loyalty stat, create a mechanic which encourages both loyalty and betrayal and set the characters free (Mountain Witch). If the game is about justice, don't create an alignment system, create characters endowed with a self-righteous sense of god's purpose and set them loose (Dogs in the Vineyard). So, to continue the parallel, if the game is about social status, don't create a social map, create a pyramid scheme.

It is now 14 years old. Note that our hobby has witnessed some astonishing revolutions in the past ten years. If you asked me in 1996 what roleplaying is my answer would be different than today.<br/><br/>I'm in my last year of studying philosophy and comparative literature and I've been considering how to breach the subject of roleplaying to the literary academia. I think Chuck's comparison with jazz improvisation is quite accurate. It is a sort of literary free improvisation around a set of rules that limit our behaviour (just like instruments, musical scales etc give musicians something to work around). The problem is that RPG sessions rarely leave something behind, which is sort of a requirement of literary aesthetics: the written page.<br/><br/>There will be a department (is that the right word in English?) of "Aesthetics of Sports" opening this year at our university, and in his "introductory" presentation, the professor talked about comparisons about a sports match and a theatrical play. The reduction of a play to its barest element that can exist is the text. The text will exist without an audience. Meanwhile in a cricket match, the barest element is the play itself. There's a lot to think about there, and I believe both areas are still largely unexplored. <br/><br/>But back to Austen...saying there can't be an Austen RPG is preposterous. And I'd also contest the claim that it would take a lot from the players. In my personal opinion Dogs or My Life don't place bigger burdens on the players than say, GURPS or D&amp;D. It's just a different kind of burden to which we are often not used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somelady" title="somelady"><img alt="somelady" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somelady">somelady</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251353/#Comment_251353" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T03:10:31+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  3:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But what would make something an Austen RPG?

It's something I find interesting about roleplaying games: when you write about a genre, you need to decide what it's about. So my postapocalyptic game, for example, will be different from yours, because we see different things as important in postapocalyptic fiction.<br/><br/>So, Chuck, you've written what you think Austen's about. For someone else, it'll just be a straight romance, like a modern romantic comedy. Other people will pick up feminist themes; still others will place social issues right in the foreground. There are lots of possible Austen games. I find that rather exciting.<br/><br/>There's a question, I think, of whether you can write an Austen game unless you understand the culture it comes from. I'd be suspicious of Austen games written by people who aren't from Britain. If that sounds harsh, imagine the criticism I'd get if I wrote a Tennessee Williams game. Perhaps a fairer way to phrase the criticism is: what does it mean to write an Austen game if you're unfamiliar with the culture?

He comes to this conclusion:\n<blockquote>In our culture at this time . . . we are willing to regard objects as works of art when once we understand the deeply humanizing role that they play in other lives. We do so . . . out of respect or moral consideration for other human beings, for at some level we recognize that a failure to accede to their classification is a failure to allow them to be heard; a failure to attend seriously to their values, aspirations, and projects.</blockquote>\nThis is actually a very sweet gesture, given that the article opens with an anecdote about arguing over whether or not RPGs are art with his then-14-year-old son. It amounts to David saying to his son Julian, "Thank you for showing me the way here," which is a nice thing for a father to say to a son.<br/><br/>That said, I like the idea of a contest, but it should be about <i>play</i> rather than <i>design</i>, and be an <i>exhibition</i> rather than a <i>contest</i>. I also like Jonathan's idea of writing about it as a scholarly project; it would make a great conference panel. I'm imagining people framing up an Austenesque game using whatever system they prefer (including a new system), running it, and then reflecting on the experience and its connection to (and deviations from) her work. Maybe we could record the games and recruit an Austen scholar to listen to them, or at least those portions that were judged by participants to be particularly noteworthy.<br/><br/>Graham's point about "understanding the culture" is well-taken, but it's not clear that just being a 21st century Briton absolutely qualifies one as an expert on Austen. The most one can say is that one is less distant from the target culture than others. I am generally suspicious of "standpoint epistemology" in any form, but others will disagree. It's like the scene in <i>Lord of the Rings</i> where Strider chides Bilbo for making up songs about Earendil in the house of Elrond.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251378/#Comment_251378" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T08:51:39+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  8:51AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chuck, I'm not wholly convinced that satire can't be included in play, given certain structural incentives and other support, but Graham's certainly right when he says that each game is going to say something about their interpretation of Austen, which is one of the most exciting parts about something like this.<br/><br/>Graham, I'd love to see your Tennessee Williams game. Or your game about the American Civil War.  I definitely sympathize with a culturalist perspective, especially considering my feelings about most RPGs set in China, but I think those difficulties can be overcome, though they are certainly significant obstacles. Jason's tackled them with Grey Ranks and made a significant game there. Think of it as the equivalent of an American company putting on Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Bill, yeah, I was thinking of a design contest more in the lines of hacking something together, as with Lady Blackbird and such, so calling it a "play exhibition" sounds like a better idea.  That would even allow cross-pollination between Austen games while play is going on, at least if folks do multiple sessions and talk about it in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251381/#Comment_251381" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T09:01:27+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  9:01AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

I'll even toss in some Jane Austen themed artwork as a prize.<br/><br/>This topic came up around our house in a big way when I was getting into Indie RPGs heaving about five years ago. My wife is a great Jane Austen fan who has given me a begrudging respect for Austen's work. Among the guests that day was a woman who once administrated one of the larger Jane Austen fan fiction communities. Not long after we played a Jane Austen themed game of Universalis. The group was a mix of non-gamers and indie-RPGers; some Austen fans, some not. <br/><br/><a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/austen.html" rel="nofollow">Here are the rather hilarious results</a>.<br/><br/>Obviously it\u2019s terribly easy for a Jane Austen game to degenerate into parody. It's not easy for 20th century people to get themselves into an Austen-era mindset. The societal rules of the time are easy to portray as ridiculous and hard to portray as meaningful. In designing an Austen RPG, that's where I would aim; mechanics that make it easy to play a character whose world is powerfully circumscribed by social and societal customs.<br/><br/>I'd also look closely at the massive body of Jane Austen fan fiction, popular fiction, and movies for inspiration. Mixing your material with a contemporary genre or trope is a pretty time-tested way to make it more approachable. There are several lines of Austen fan fiction on the premise of Mr. Darcy and Lizzy Bennet as crime sleuths. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is also not necessarily a bad way to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry" title="Chuck Henebry"><img alt="Chuck Henebry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry">Chuck Henebry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251546/#Comment_251546" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T05:50:11+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  5:50AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2010 6:06AM by Chuck Henebry.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yesterday, when I posted what I saw as crucial elements, I was hoping the rest of you would respond with suggestions to add to that list, as a first step toward deciding what we collectively mean by the phrase "Jane Austen rpg".<br/><br/>To my way of thinking, such a game should enact the plot structure, the social ethos and the tone of the books. So (for me, at least) simply transposing the characters from an Austen novel into a genre like detective fiction is "cheating": i.e. it doesn't accomplish our stated goal of creating a Jane Austen rpg. That's not to say that it wouldn't be fun to do.<br/><br/>[edit] Reading "Space and Spaceability" now. Funny stuff! Miss India sounds like she comes out of a Thackeray novel. <br/><br/>Sp &amp; Spby also contains an interesting lesson in game design and game play: what to do when the players collectively run riot, violating genre conventions? I assume that we don't want to <i>limit</i> play to Jane Austen appropriate settings and events, but rather a game that makes possible (indeed, prompts and encourages) such play.<br/><br/>Board games typically limit play to genre-appropriate activities: players of Monopoly can make bad bargains, if they so choose, but they cannot refuse to collect rent without breaking the rules. To play Monopoly is to play the role of a capitalist landowning rent-taker.<br/><br/>What makes rpgs like improvisational jazz is the group's collective freedom to break genre conventions. Going back to the early days of the hobby, that freedom allowed AD&amp;D groups to run games that focused on stuff like international politics\u2014despite the absence of any rules for conducting diplomacy. <br/><br/>But I fear I'm being tedious here, in this long postscript, and I'm sure I'm not saying anything at this point that hasn't occurred to the rest of you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251555/#Comment_251555" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T06:53:25+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  6:53AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2010 6:53AM by Teataine.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chuck, sometimes saying out loud, or rephrasing something one already "<i>knows</i>" can do wonders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251560/#Comment_251560" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T07:36:35+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  7:36AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, let's also not forget that Austen herself wasn't just celebrating the social hierarchies and customs of her era, she was also skewering them.

The idea that folks back then were oh-so-terribly-constrained by social conventions, whereas we modern folk are a bunch of free spirits, is bogus in the extreme. I think a better explanation of why, no matter how good the rules were, an Austen game would be bound to descend into parody, actually has more to do with the very profoundly intimate and revelatory nature of the relationships that would have to be acted out there. When two people are playing strongly distinctive, intelligent and autonomous characters who are busy falling in love, it gets awfully difficult to retain one's aesthetic detachment.<br/><br/>I'll bet some of those crazy Jeepform types could pull it off, though. Also, I have a colleague who's a devout RPGer and has written a (very interesting)  book on Jane Austen.

Maybe I'm getting you wrong. In any case, I disagree. To my mind, how people lived within their social conventions within the Regency period was extremely different than how people live today. That's the difference I'm aiming at. One of the things I'm most interested in about any historical period gaming is playing characters whose view of the world and their place in it is very different from ours today.<br/><br/>I'll try to provide a concrete example. Imagine a time and place where a man and woman can only be alone together under rather specific circumstances. In such a setting, having a private conversation with a member of the opposite sex could be legitimate fodder for a challenging and interesting scene in an RPG. What consequences is a character willing to accept to break social convention? Or can they find a way to circumvent it? That's interesting gaming to me. This is why something like a Regency era murder mystery is also interesting to me. How does a murder mystery story play out when you place it within that social context?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251588/#Comment_251588" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T09:51:13+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  9:51AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add that this kind of exploration of historical setting is exactly what i wrote Principia for, however, I don't think Principia is right for Austen.

Like the samurai of Timothy Kleinert's game, the five Bennet sisters and their friends all have mastered the same skill set: conversation, sketching, cardplaying, etc. And they must rely on one another for help in overcoming the rivals and rakes that stand in their path. <br/><br/>The physical challenges of Timothy Kleinert's game become social challenges in this game. In place of character death we'll have the sort of social death suffered by Lizzie's sister Lydia when she falls prey to the charms of Mr. Wickham (running off to live with him in sin, before finally marrying). And to triumph as Lizzie does by winning Mr. Darcy is to defeat the Pride which is the true villain of the piece. In this sense, the physical combat of the Mountain Witch would be for this game an allegory of the moral suasion enacted by characters in Austen's novel. Not sure if this makes sense to you all, but think of Spenser's Faerie Queene or Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.<br/><br/>But there's a deeper discrepancy between Kleinert's game and Austen's novel: Pride and Prejudice isn't a story of good and evil, or even of betrayal\u2014not at bottom. Wickham is indeed wicked, but Darcy turns out not to be a witch, and Austen is careful to present her heroine as flawed in a way which matches (indeed, complements) her hero's Pride. Nor does outright betrayal (the core mechanic of Kleinert's game) play a crucial role in the relationships of the Bennett sisters. <br/><br/>My guess is that this would be worth trying out, but not a full solution to the problem of creating an Austen-themed rpg.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251624/#Comment_251624" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T13:27:07+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  1:27PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chuck Henebry</cite><b>Everyone:</b>I'm beginning to think that a forum may not be the best possible medium for pushing this project to the next phase. There are a couple of different ideas currently running in this thread as to how we might proceed from here: a contest, a collaborative effort.... How do we decide, and how do we get people to choose roles in setting up the contest or in organizing the collaboration?</blockquote>\nWell, let's hash out some conceptual goals, then, in terms of what the project is intended to achieve. Jonathan's idea of producing something for a scholarly audience (or multiple scholarly audiences) -- something that can go on the curricula vitae of participants who care about such things -- is in line with my goals and interests. A conference presentation followed by a submission to a scholarly journal (one article or several) is a good way to go. For example, we could propose a special issue of the <i><a href="http://www.journalofroleplaying.org/" rel="nofollow">International Journal of Roleplaying</a></i>, perhaps as an additional release rather than a replacement for their annual number.<br/><br/>The choice of venue will shape the project and the timetable. For example, if we decide to submit a panel presentation to the <a href="http://www.jasna.org/agms/index.html" rel="nofollow">Jane Austen Society</a>, which next meets in Portland OR in October 2010, we'll maybe set different goals than if we go for <a href="http://www.mla.org/convention" rel="nofollow">MLA</a> in Los Angeles in January 2011.<br/><br/>So my proposal, in a nutshell, is this:<br/><br/>(1) Each "entry" will be an approach to gaming Austen, whether using an existing system, a hack, or home-brew is immaterial. The requirements are that the game be <i>played</i> and then somehow "written up" -- as ethnography, as discourse analysis, as criticism, as introspective reportage, e.g. -- so as to answer questions of interest to us as a community as well as the intended scholarly audience (e.g., for whom and in what way did the game serve as a "deeply humanizing experience"?). Multiple people can contribute to an entry; for example, you might have a designer and a separate analyst of the game.<br/><br/>(2) We take those entries and submit them to some scholarly venue with an eye toward publicly presenting the entries, getting feedback from a tolerantly bemused scholarly audience and incorporating those comments into the next iteration: scholarly publication, either as separate submissions or as part of a special issue, or as chapter of an edited book. McFarland publishes all sorts of weird pop-cultural studies stuff; this would be right up their alley.<br/><br/>But that's just a rough sketch; I'm interested in modifications and concrete counter-proposals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251635/#Comment_251635" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T15:15:00+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  3:15PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chuck, you should totally run that Mountain Witch hack and tell us about it.<br/><br/>Bill, your plan sounds pretty great.

So you make a <i>method* </i>that taps into this well of resources. You go for rules light, and make a method based on rituals and routines that enables the players to weave plots and relations with highly focused or highly flexible setting-material.

Designing with sense and sensibility enables us to take on any artistic challenge, including the design of games which is the interactive equivalent of a Jane Austen drama.

And as in any good drama they must realize this, and change, to fulfill the promise of love.<br/><br/>I believe it is time for Austen-night in the sofa again, wallowing in the perfect BBC-adaptation, for my wife and me. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251734/#Comment_251734" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T08:04:24+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  8:04AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2010 12:21PM by lordgoon.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>The idea that folks back then were oh-so-terribly-constrained by social conventions, whereas we modern folk are a bunch of free spirits, is bogus in the extreme.</blockquote>\nUh... this sounds sort of like you're saying "Austen era folks were just like us".</blockquote>\nIt does?

I've read Rene (sorry for the lack of accents, not sure how to do them in this window), and the game does capture something, but it's a friendly send-up, not an attempt at emulation.<br/><br/>Curiously, this topic used to come up on rpg.net once every year or so, though it hasn't in the past few years.  It always devolved unfortunately into the question of combat mechanics.  Someone would always say that an Austen game didn't require such, someone else would say that a game should contain rules for those things which the characters may do, and that an Austenian heroine could potentially shoot a rival therefore the rules should permit that.  Others would reply saying that since that didn't happen, and wasn't the point, the rules need not cater for it.  The response would be than an rpg requires freedom to act in ways the original source material might not envisage.  And so on.<br/><br/>I never saw the argument resolved, usually the person interested in creating something Austenian gave up, swamped with suggestions as to how to model guns of the period.  But of course, if you're going down that road you might as well just play it with Gurps or whatever, there's no need for a bespoke system at all.<br/><br/>One query, I've not yet read Austen so this may be off base, but my understanding of the concept of ruin in the period is that it is not simply an issue of social embarassment, it's not a question of flouting convention, it's what the word suggests.  Ruin.  If you can't marry, you are condemned in all likelihood unless you have a reasonable competence to poverty, in later periods perhaps to grinding and poorly paid work as a governess (I don't know if that was an option in Austen's period, it certainly was a common fate later).  Other fiction of the period is often driven by the fear of ruin, a woman who loses her reputation cannot marry and so faces penury, the drivers are intensely pragmatic ones in part.  <br/><br/>This is an era without state relief for the unfortunate.  If you go bankrupt, you may go to prison.  An unwise speculation could cast a family from affluence to degradation.  Ruin is not just people cutting you at the Hunt Ball, it is losing your home and being without prospect of ever regaining what was lost.<br/><br/>Is that a driver in Austen?

It always devolved unfortunately into the question of combat mechanics.  Someone would always say that an Austen game didn't require such, someone else would say that a game should contain rules for those things which the characters may do, and that an Austenian heroine could potentially shoot a rival therefore the rules should permit that.  Others would reply saying that since that didn't happen, and wasn't the point, the rules need not cater for it.  The response would be than an rpg requires freedom to act in ways the original source material might not envisage.  And so on.</blockquote>\nWell, what we really will need for the game are rules for <b>falling</b> and <b>drowning.</b> As we all know, that's the acid test for a completist set of game rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry" title="Chuck Henebry"><img alt="Chuck Henebry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry">Chuck Henebry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251941/#Comment_251941" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T19:07:41+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  7:07PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>One query, I've not yet read Austen so this may be off base, but my understanding of the concept of ruin in the period is that it is not simply an issue of social embarassment, it's not a question of flouting convention, it's what the word suggests.  Ruin.  If you can't marry, you are condemned in all likelihood unless you have a reasonable competence to poverty, in later periods perhaps to grinding and poorly paid work as a governess (I don't know if that was an option in Austen's period, it certainly was a common fate later).  Other fiction of the period is often driven by the fear of ruin, a woman who loses her reputation cannot marry and so faces penury, the drivers are intensely pragmatic ones in part. ...<br/><br/>Is that a driver in Austen?  If so, would your game capture the fact that the driver for marriage isn't simply romance, it's economic necessity.</blockquote>\nYou're absolutely right, and I'm glad you wrote in to remind us of why characters in Austen's novels worried so much about not marrying well. For a counterargument in British fiction you have to wait for George Eliot's Middlemarch\u2014though Austen herself provides a real-life counterargument, a spinster who lives well precisely by avoiding marriage. <br/><br/>Regardless of the seriousness of economic ruin, I'm not sure how this should impact the game mechanics. It's certainly vital info for the flavor text, to help explain why social death and economic ruin are ends commensurate with physical death in other games. But just as other games don't need a mechanic for detailing how sword wounds lead to character death, we don't need a <i>mechanic</i> for this aspect of the books.                        </div>\n<div

arbitrary statements about what we do and don't need in an Austen game or what is or isn't possible given the current state of roleplaying mechanics.  For example, I really liked Max's suggestion and could imagine mechanics based around it.<br/><br/>Like, for Pride &amp; Prejudice: One player plays the Mother, who is responsible for managing the family finances. It is that player's responsibility to see that the family ends the game in the best financial situation possible.  One player plays the Father, who can only intervene in the Mother's decision making at the request of a daughter and only to ensure the daughter's ultimate happiness.<br/><br/>Boom, interesting narrative and mechanical tension, based on a mingling of different Keys / victory conditions / powers / etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251948/#Comment_251948" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T19:42:21+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  7:42PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>my understanding of the concept of ruin in the period is that it is not simply an issue of social embarassment, it's not a question of flouting convention, it's what the word suggests.  Ruin.  If you can't marry, you are condemned in all likelihood unless you have a reasonable competence to poverty, in later periods perhaps to grinding and poorly paid work as a governess (I don't know if that was an option in Austen's period, it certainly was a common fate later).  Other fiction of the period is often driven by the fear of ruin, a woman who loses her reputation cannot marry and so faces penury, the drivers are intensely pragmatic ones in part.<br/><br/>This is an era without state relief for the unfortunate.  If you go bankrupt, you may go to prison.  An unwise speculation could cast a family from affluence to degradation.  Ruin is not just people cutting you at the Hunt Ball, it is losing your home and being without prospect of ever regaining what was lost.<br/><br/>Is that a driver in Austen?  If so, would your game capture the fact that the driver for marriage isn't simply romance, it's economic necessity.</blockquote>\nI think this is a bit of an overstatement. While women usually didn't have formal inheritance rights, women from affuent families who stayed unmarried would usually be granted some sort of modest annuity - enough to maintain a small household and perhaps have one or two servants - unless their nearest male relatives were absolute monsters or else the family fortune took a turn for the worst.<br/><br/>Poor women who didn't get married were much worse off, but then of course if you were a poor woman you were only ever going to marry a poor dude anyway (unless you were a character in a Disney movie) so no biggie.<br/><br/>I have spent much of today coming up with a sketch of some rules for an Austen game that I think just might work. It's a sort of ghastly amalgam of<i> It's Complicated</i>, <i>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</i> and cerftain upscale murder mystery parties I've attended.

An rpg without rules for such things is no proper rpg at all.<br/><br/>I admit, I've never actually used the rules for either, and when anyone has fallen or indeed risked drowning (which has happened surprisingly little over my gaming career) I've just made something up on the spot rather than stop the game to check rules that almost never arise, but their presence is a comfort and a sign that the game is properly and exhaustively designed.<br/><br/>It's like lifting weight.  I was looking at Earthdawn recently, and wondering why in god's name I would ever want to know my character's lifting weight according to their strength.  However, should I ever need such information (and surely I shall soon, it's not come up in the past 30 years of gaming so I must be about due) it would be a great comfort to know the matter was properly addressed.<br/><br/>Does My Life with Master cover how much weight characters can lift?

It is definitely worth your while to scope out the feel of the conference. I'm not an Austen specialist, but while there is some interest in contemporary versions of canonical texts, by an large, there is often a very strong historical bias to many period based conferences.  The real danger is not so much that you won't be accepted, but that there won't be much interest when you get there.  It's always a real disappointment to go a long way to conference and only have a few people watch your presentation--say, having the two other speakers drop out, getting four in the audience, two of them friends (with no interest in the topic) and two silent other people. In the end the line on your CV isn't worth that much.<br/><br/>My gut feeling would be that you'd do best at a Cultural Studies conference of some sort, somewhere you see work on pop culture, adaptation, etc.  Ideally you'd want to get both those interested in Austen and those interested in RPGs in the audience.  The problem with an Austen conference is that the participants are already saturated with other opportunities to talk about Austen. That leaves you without a really strong draw, though the panel might be popular amongst fans if there is that sort of participation.  Given the way all of you have been framing the terms of the conversation--and given David Novitz's construction of the topic--you'll be better at a conference whose participants have strong theoretical as opposed to historicist inclinations.  In my own field, for instance, I might propose a panel on rpgs and Shakespeare (for instance) at GEMCS (the group for early modern cultural studies) but not to the Renaissance Society of America.<br/><br/>Don't let any of that discourage you, but if you want a really good response from the audience as a whole, that's the kind of place to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252100/#Comment_252100" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T12:53:22+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 12:53PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The real danger is not so much that you won't be accepted, but that there won't be much interest when you get there.

Though since I teach philosophy, a room with three people in it, all attacking my arguments, can sometimes seem awfully full.<br/><br/>One conference I've actually been to a couple of times, where a carefree, interdisciplinary attitude seems to prevail is the annual meeting of the Southwestern Society for Eighteenth Century Studies.
