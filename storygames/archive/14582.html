I ran one a few years ago that lasted about 50 sessions :) But it fell apart at the end as things became increasingly immersion-breaking. (why the hell is HE appearing? Why doesn't X happen instead).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - what I need to ask is some help at "layering" things that my players can dig into. Or just ways of continuing the story once the immediate "plot" has been resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've done is take a page from the Apocalypse World guide to GM'ing :) I have the a bunch of "fronts" or threats that are interacting with the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setting is a remote province of an empire - much like Roman Britain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main fronts are:<br/>\nForest Tribes: led by a magical warlord - aiming to invade the province and take back the land.<br/>\n   - next secret - looking for reborn "rightful king" to bring glory and unite the tribes<br/>\n<br/>\nLocal Farmers: Just want to be safe and not pay high taxes.<br/>\n   - next secret - raising rebel cells to fight the tax collectors/nobles<br/>\n<br/>\nImperial Governor + families: Want to conquer surrounding lands.<br/>\n  - next secret - sacrificing towns/soldiers as excuse to raise more Legions from homeland.<br/>\n    - next secret - Splinter group of Noble families want independence from Empire.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure how to run a game that might last 20+ sessions, so I need more possible storylines (or some way of making better fronts / more fronts)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332063/#Comment_332063" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T10:39:50+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 10:39AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can also draw story arcs from your player's background (they're there for a reason.)<br/><br/>Develop NPC retainers and the like that evenutally need help/rescuing.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332066/#Comment_332066" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T10:49:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 10:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You will hit 20+ sessions by having the fronts change and people/groups split away and form new fronts.<br/><br/>The key is the fronts changing over time.  They will adapt and do what they have to do to accomplish their agendas.  If a front is wiped out, look for possible threats to pop up and replace them.  Just think from your NPCs perspective and have them react in a realistic way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332102/#Comment_332102" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T13:09:32+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  1:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really know what qualifies something as a "front", I'm not up on AW at all, but here's what I would do with what you have:<br/><br/>Reduce these to people, not general desires. Like the forest tribes:<br/><br/>There's a dude John in this one tribe who wants to find the rightful king, and he's got some influence through his best friend Mike. But Beth doesn't want John to find the rightful king because they might find out she dumped him in a well when he was two? And the rightful king Leo is in love with this non-forest-tribe dude Frank, who is married to a mixed-tribe outcast, Julie, etc. etc. <br/><br/>Just make a big fucking tangle of people for each of these. Then when you are deciding how each front moves, you can put it in the hands of a specific person, and then trace out what people might do in response to how the front moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332111/#Comment_332111" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T13:40:55+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  1:40PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right: the key is letting it evolve naturally and appropriately.<br/><br/>Every time something happens in play, look through your list of people and factions.
