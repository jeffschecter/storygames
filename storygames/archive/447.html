                    [ For the purpose of discussion below, meta-metagame refers to mechanics that are very (if not totally) disconnected from the action inside the game, a step removed ]<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on a system for a while now. I've played it four sessions, and each was good. One thing bugs me though, and this is what I will be thrashing on about here.<br/>
<br/>
The game is pretty removed from the conventional rpg, using story/drama power as the basis more than stats. The core is very solid and works well. Outside the core is 'advantage'. This is represented by cards which the players hold in hand. Through various rules, the cards can be played to: Override rolls of the dice, Protect their character from fallout, Establish new character situation (like a stat), and so on. These rules all seem well and good, connecting the advantage cards to the roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
There are other rules to establish motion of cards. Just holding onto a bunch of cards and using them seems... bland. These rules aren't connected to the roleplay but pure metagame. This is where my feelings become mixed.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the card motion and play comes to the forefront, and then the roleplay falls to the back, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. So I find myself asking: When do things get too meta? How much metagame is too much? For the kind of drama-based play I want the game to provide I obviously need metagame, so the question becomes how much?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm wondering if other designers/players have an experience in the realm, and their thoughts on the matter. :)                </div>

                            I figure just start writing, then give it 1-3 playtests.  If cards are coming too much into the forefront, then hamstring the rules so that it reduces their influence until you find a range to your liking.  I really think this is one of those things that can only be found and corrected through play.                        </div>

<p>I'm not sure there's really an inherent zero-sum game between meta-play and in-story-play.</p>
<p>When I design, and I think "Wow, there's way more meta-play than in-story-play" I generally try to figure out how to add <em>more</em> story without giving up any of my happy meta-goodness.  But maybe that's just me.</p>

Jason, your complaint is that there is stuff happening at the table that isn't related to the fiction?  So I'm assuming the card-movement rules (and getting a new card) aren't keyed to things happening in the fiction?  Have you played the game without the card-movement rules at all?                        </div>

Yes that sounds reasonable. After playtest now I've come back to the design step, and I'm contemplating doing a total alteration. The idea of advantage as I use it is so- abstract and unlinked that I think I need to do one of two things:<br/>
<br/>
- Link the already rather heavy ruleset for card motion to actual events in the game,<br/>
- or remove the cardplay at together and try another lighter solution.<br/>
<br/>
Tony,<br/>
<br/>
That sounds perfectly reasonable. So now I'm just faced with the eternal design question: How much is too much? (in regards to rules)<br/>
<br/>
Josh,<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Yes. No. Without the cardplay rules, there really wouldn't be much game. Hmmm, I think I'll try and drum up a good example of what I'm talking about and post it as a response here.<br/>

                            I am not sure that the bracket that started off this whole conversation might not be itself part of the difficulty you're facing.  There are all sorts of mechanics in all sorts of games that cheerfully straddle this line: action dice in Spycraft, Drama Points in Buffy...anything related to genre, anything at all, makes idenfitying "meta" mechanics incredibly hard. When someone spends a Drama Point in Buffy to say "I think I'm okay!" and restore a bunch of Life Points after a fight, surely this is deeply connected to the action inside the game. In fact, it's a key part of the game's simulation of TV action-comedy style combat. Yet of course none of the characters know anything about Drama Points. <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest thinking of a different way of identifying what troubles you about what you've got and what you're aiming at.                        </div>

                            I thought it was pretty clear actually, I have a set of mechanics that are a step removed from play. Card movement does not link to play, though they are initiated by the resolution method.                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>I'm very unclear what you mean by "Removed from play" actually. Nothing you've described sounds like it's outside of play to me. You mean like, y'all are sitting around a table playing, and someone is sitting off to the side playing with cards?<br/>That's metagame?<br/><br/>You mean non-involving? Non-fun?                        </div>

Ah ok, an explanation. Sure, we are all playing the game. What I'm talking about is a distinct disconnect from what is happening in the mechanics, like in this case its moving about cards, from the fiction-roleplay part. Does that make sense?                        </div>

<p>Hmm. See, I don't think it's useful to stigmatize some part of play as "metagame," because that's a totally value-neutral word. It's like asking, "How many people can play a RPG?" There's not one single answer that exists outside the context of <em>your</em> game.</p>
<p>So that's why I'm suggesting you get more specific in judging specifically how you've come to decide that <em>something</em> is not so good.</p>
<p>So prop-based mechanics you've got include:<br/>
Rolling dice - This is working?<br/>
Playing cards from a hand - This is working too?<br/>
Cards "move" - This is the part that's bugging you?</p>
<p>I'm still a little confused by how this "card motion" works. Why are cards moving? What event triggers cards moving? I assume you're not passing cards around in some arbitrary madcap fashion. The only reason you're doing this is because "holding a hand of cards is boring?"</p>

The players vie for advantage, trying to earn the spotlight for their characters (at the close of a session or triggered by certain game outcomes). This is handled as: Spotlight for the character of the player with the best hand, in this case just the three best cards count by adding rank. So moving the cards around is a way to get this for you and your character.                        </div>

<p>Well, I've been using the system to run a BSG game. The characters here are defined by their connection to obvious aligned forces in the world: Colonial Military, Underground, Cylons, etc. Without connections a character is lost, either having been killed or just not important enough to warrant game play. The spotlight is a way to earn more connections for a character, giving them more power and lifespan.</p>
