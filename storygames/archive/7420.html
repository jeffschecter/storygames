The whale reminds them of their mortality and shows them the value of every tiny moment of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis poem should be played among friends and consists of scenes in which one person is lying on the floor and the others gather around him or her. One of the standing persons kneels by the whale and starts to stroke him in a soothing way. The whale tells him or her one short episode from his or her life from the perspective of a third person. Then in the next scene different persons play the whale and the soother. When everybody's been the whale and the soother the whale dies and everybody says a short mourning speech (three or four sentences).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165018/#Comment_165018" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T15:23:22+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  3:23PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the game need to involve touching?<br><br>I think that might become uncomfortable for some players in a way that doesn't enhance the game at all. Also, if I saw a dying whale and wanting to get all reflective, I'd be standing ten feet away and pulling close my jacket.
