Lots of new game ideas popping up and lots of art done. It's got me thinking about how it works for me. I'll share my process, you share yours. I be we all work in different ways and can learn from those differences. <br/><br/>I usually start off with a rules mechanic idea and an idea of how to make something. Right now it is something I'm calling the "Make some noise" mechanic and making games using cards.<br/><br/>With the mechanic - players get to make one move and one action a turn. Characters are represented using cards and the move between locations, represented by different cards. To do an action they play an action card from their deck or point to a face up card on the table and do that action. The roll they need to make to make something happen is based on what they do at the table. If they quietly roll they have a poor chance of success. If they make an appropriate noise - battle cry, car engine, monster growl, etc. they get a better than 50/50 roll. If they brag about how good they do they get a great roll. The point is to get them making some noise at the table and interacting with one another. <br/><br/>So I see how the game will work and how to make it. Then ideas on how to apply it start coming to mind. So far I've had about five different game ideas come to mind. Got one of them done and ready to go for this convention season (Hungry Dragon - a dragon fighting, stealing and not getting eaten game). Other ideas come to me - post apocalyptic motor cycle race game, car chase, dragon building game and more that I've not started working on. When the idea hits I get a burst on energy and drive into making art. It is amazing how fast they can come together sometimes. Other times the energy dies and the idea goes dormant - waiting for the next burst of energy.<br/><br/>This is the funnest part of the game making process. The selling is the least fun - because that's when I learn they no one likes my idea. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408721/#Comment_408721" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T07:44:04+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  7:44AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my case I can't avoid how much compulsive energy has a role.

I establish some thoughts about how to play the game and then tries to write notes about how I need to change my gaming style to adopt to my game (it sounds weird, but it always happens). What gives me the most is when someone take the controlling part (as a GM or the one who knows the rules) so I can see how that person's style differs from mine. I take more notes about that.<br/><br/>When the game is "finished", I write it. While writing, I try to read other (unusual) games, so I can steal their ideas on how to present the text. It's then time for blind playtesting. The response from the playtesters demands rewrites.

At least the one that has proven to work for me after some trial and error:<br/><br/>1. Idea. Usually not mechanical--I think, "I want a game that does this", where <i>this</i> isn't rules or procedures or interactions, but rather a high-level concept. "I want to make a game about Eminem!" etc. Procedure and rules ideas usually come coupled with it, though.<br/><br/>2. I turn the effing computer off and take out a notebook. I design by writing out my thought processes: What do I want play to look like? What kind of experience do I want players to get from play?  My notebook at this stage looks like a dialogue with myself. I start working on procedures and rules, up to and including the whole system. I focus on parts at a time, but often my mind jumps from part to part, and in this stage that's okay. I do imaginary playtesting: what would happen in this situation? What are likely and unlikely player choices? What do those do to the game?<br/><br/>3. At the end of stage two I have a complete alpha game, but not a complete alpha draft. I write the alpha draft. This is actually pretty easy compared to the hard work of part 2. I try to write as complete a draft as I can, as "finished" as I can, even though I know it's an alpha.<br/><br/>4. I playtest it, for the first time. I have some idea of how it'll work from my imaginary playtesting, and I don't get to this stage until I've thought through the implications of every rule and interaction that I can, which happens in stage 2 (obviously I will have missed some).<br/><br/>5. Revise the game based on those playtests, fold it into the draft.<br/><br/>6. Playtest it until it's done. Get outside playtesting if I can.<br/><br/>7. Write the final draft (I'm in this stage for what looks to be my first finished game right now, so beyond here my process is hazy).<br/><br/>8. Publish, which is itself an entire process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408781/#Comment_408781" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T18:57:43+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  6:57PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>Back in 2006, I outlined my 12 step process: <a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2006/04/what-is-troys-12-step-process.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2006/04/what-is-troys-12-step-process.html</a> <br/><br/>It's still close to what I do.

I found there is a method to my madness:<br/>1) I need an idea, sometimes it is a cool mechanic, but usually it is a setting. In Steampunk Crescendo, the idea is I wanted a vampire game I could play that was not d20 and didn't come with a lot of WW baggage. At the time I did not understand that MLwM could have vampires and Annalise was not out yet.<br/>2) I make a brief note in EverNote, like "Mechs in medieval britain." That way I can recall these ideas.<br/>3) I think about it a lot. I try and figure out what the PCs will do, what the NPCs do and what the setting looks like. As Iworkthis out mechanics start forming. During this time, I am organizing m thoughts. No ntoes are taken, I just try and understand what the game is about.<br/>4) I make an outline of the mechnics. I try and make it playable by other human beings.<br/>5) I evaluate the mchanics. I look for things like: "Is it almost as fun to lose a conflict  as win one," "Is there more than one viable way to win a conflict," "Do the mechanics work without the aid of computer," "Does a completed character have a meaningful choice once a conflict starts (i.e., can they win the conflict using mroe than one strategy)," "Do the mechanics work for physical, mental, social, etc. conflicts," "Do the mechanics work with one vs many conflicts," "do the mechanics work with PvP conflicts," "How hard is it to make a character for this mechanic," "if a PC is killed, how does the player of a dead PC have fun," "Can I explain this to another human being," "How does a scene get started," "what does a conflict look like in this setting?" I do most of this in my head with aid from spreadsheets for evaluating math, tactics, etc.<br/>6) Play it with myself using dice and pencils. So, some of the crazier mechanics I have come up with died at this step. If there is too much info, too many stat changes, etc. during a conflict, then this mechanic gets simplified. No matter what my mechanics get simplified at this step.<br/>7) Play it with one sympatheic player. The point of this step is twofold: 1) See if it does make sense to other humans, 2) make note of the language that you need to use to describe the ideas of this game. Use them in the text of the game.<br/>8) Fix it. At this point, you have seen flaws and made mistakes, fix them.<br/>9) Solidify the setting. Playtesting will be pretty rough without a world to interact with, do that now.<br/>10) Make an Alpha playtest draft and play the game<br/>11) Modify the text to acount for rules changes/clarfications, GM methods and better explanations of mechanics.<br/>12) External playtest. Get some one else to run your game. Even if it is only fo one session, the information you gather will be amazing!<br/>13) Refine text<br/>14) Publish<br/><br/>There is more, but I wasn't sure how deep you wanted to go down the rabbit hole,<br/>Dave M<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408788/#Comment_408788" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T23:56:11+00:00" title="March 11, 2013 11:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly I muck around with stuff here and there and don't get all that much done.

Usually, it's a character sheet and character generation (possibly even maps). Everything else is in my head, or a rough copy on a piece of paper. When you're in the playtesting phase, you add more and more to the spine as the game gets developed. So I never start off with the full game, even if I have ideas about how it should work. I start with the very essential things so I can add things to it.<br/><br/>By doing this, it's easier to be open to new ideas, to pinpoint what's wrong in your game and you don't have to rewrite your game during the process.\n<blockquote>Waiting for "the right idea" will not help you.</blockquote>\nThis made me think of what the Swedish author Jan Guillou once said (I quote freely). "There is no such thing as a writer's block. You need to sit down and write. For me, writing is work so I start at 8 am and finish at 5 pm."<br/><br/>A book on the subject called Skriv b\xe4ttre texter (eng. Write Better Texts) told me that if you got a writer's block, you haven't done the proper groundwork. So go back and redo the previous steps. In my case, it's the playtesting. I playtest until I can't get anything more out if it (my last game took 21 playtests) and then I go on writing the game. Because I've done the groundwork - both noting inspirational stuff that happened and how it happened - there's no problem for me to come up with stuff to write. Almost all of my examples in my games are from the played sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408817/#Comment_408817" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T07:50:17+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  7:50AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +100 Joe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408820/#Comment_408820" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T08:11:47+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  8:11AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2013 8:12AM by mease19.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A neat idea leads to scrawled notes.

This is typically done with a notepad I keep around. Much of the initial material that comes out feels like it is a fully-formed game, but typically much of it will be carved away during the subsequent steps; nonetheless, I try my best to get every last drop of it down, because those bursts of inspiration are unpredictable.<br/><br/>I usually give the idea a cursory revision as I'm transferring it into typed form, but only to clarify ideas so that later I'll remember what I was on about. Once all of the material conserved from that initial outpouring has been set down, it goes on my hard drive. Sometimes it stays there a while (e.g., the initial seed of what has turned into <i>Corona</i> sat on my hard drive for four years, until I decided on a whim to reopen it and found it useful in a completely different form than its original conception). If the project is something for a game design competition that has an arbitrary and confining time limit, this step may not happen, though.<br/><br/>Once I revive an idea from cold storage, it gets another one or two passes at the notes/brainstorming/outline level before a coherent draft starts. This is typically to shape it into what it's going to be as opposed to what it was initially going to be, to discard appendages that no longer fit the type of game it's shaping up to be, and to figure out how well the individual pieces actually <b>work</b>.<br/><br/>The draft process continues for a while, depending on circumstances; <i>House of Cards</i> was composed over about three years in the middle of my doctoral coursework, but <i>Corona</i> has only taken about one since I'm just dissertating now. A few trusted individuals get to see these early versions for feedback, but playtesting doesn't happen until at least a third draft. I have a group that I know perform playtesting, but the majority of testing happens at conventions with strangers.<br/><br/>At some point, I start feeling what I refer to as 'stage fright,' where I realize I'm rewriting something over and over as a means of avoiding putting it out into the world, which is how I know I'm nearly finished. I'll usually take about two more months to fiddle with something once I reach this stage, and then decide to release it just so I can be relieved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408873/#Comment_408873" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T19:34:17+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  7:34PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

Never when I have a pen or a keyboard at hand. Ever. So, I juggle lots of stuff. Like, Combat Archeology I think is back on the burner for me and Eschaton is in the fridge.<br/><br/>So, on my lunch break or if I make a point to go to a coffee shop, and I have a pad of graph paper and an ink pen, I just like write everything out that the idea takes. For 6i, I looked at the list of human cultural universals, picked the ones that made sense, then wrote like a two sentence treatment for each of them and gave them a conceptual name. So, it could have been like Sixty Inhumanities I guess.<br/><br/>Once that happened, I sat down and typed it up, doing so changed things around. Cut it down and edited it, laid it out, found some epigraphs, edited it again, released it, more hotfixes, rerelased it.<br/><br/>It was a modest project, so I think it like took me six billable hours over two weeks.<br/><br/>My advice is to try to get to the point where you're laying things out as quickly as possible and then put it out there and see what happens.

How do you juggle that?</blockquote><b>How are you writing?</b><br/>By machine, sitting down to write from start to finish, or by the flow presented to me in the matter at hand.<br/><br/><b>How do you approach that writing? </b><br/>By SITTING DOWN at the screen! The "approach" is that I will write when I sit there, and should strive to sit down to do that.<br/><br/><b>What kind of writing is it?</b><br/>The writing as a handicraft! I write what I must do to make the game come trough to other players and leaders. Sometimes that include trying to create beautiful passages of text, to inspire players.<br/><br/><b>Do you keep it all in your head?</b> <br/>No, I write it down! LOL<br/>I have notes, but most of it comes through my head, my hearth and my fingers ...<br/>The process of writing a game is the same as writing any other book; you need to automate it! WRITING A LOT is important to make a game-text flow easily into the screen, especially if that crucial moment comes when you have a great game to write.<br/><br/><b>How do you juggle that?</b><br/>No "juggling" involved! And no magic! It is hard work, skill, will and patience! If you do a lot of hard work, if you hone your writing skills, if you are strong-willed and keep at it ... then the process may transcend into the realm of magic!<br/><br/><b>Good luck!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408892/#Comment_408892" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T04:53:26+00:00" title="March 13, 2013  4:53AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">@Hans_c-o</a>: I write all the headlines and perhaps a short summary. It can otherwise happen that I get to a headline without knowing what it should be about. I then sit down and write one or two headlines a day. When writing, it's more important to get it written than how it's written. Don't think about spell checking, layout or if you're using the correct grammar. Think about the tone and how you should present it. Write for your sake, not for the readers.<br/><br/>The first rewrite is then about making it more readable. You have the content, but you need to rewrite it for your readers, both so they can understand it but mostly that you can keep them interested. I usually keep the old text in a headline and use it as a guideline to rewrite the whole headline. Think about using the correct grammar, how you should present it and what tools you can use to enhance the understanding of the text. For example, write small notes about pictures and captures. But most of all, let time pass before you do your first rewrite so the text in the first draft becomes more unaccustomed. It increases the chances to find the wrong bits in your text.<br/><br/>I'm currently, as I'm writing this post, rewriting <b>This Is Pulp</b> where the first draft was written two months ago. I started off by rereading <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17895/how-should-i-write-my-rules-so-people-can-grok-them/p1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> to get some inspiration for how to think when it comes to presenting the text. How to keep interest. How I should repeat important parts. How I can vary myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408919/#Comment_408919" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T11:57:46+00:00" title="March 13, 2013 11:57AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My actual writing/design process is very ideosyncratic and not something I feel like suggesting to anyone else.

Planarch Codex was like this:<br/><br/>1. Idea arises in SG thread. Throw ideas around with Hans and others.<br/>2. Make cover mock-up based on old Jennifer Rodgers art I have sitting around. Get positive feedback.<br/>3. Start thinking: "Hey maybe there's a real thing here."<br/>4. Write up some notes about how to deal with race and ethnicity in a more interesting way. Write up some ideas about setting.<br/>5. Hans runs a sketch of the game at GameStorm 2012. It's okay, but clearly isn't quite all there yet.<br/>6. Develop an adventure concept about djinn and the fire sea. Get really excited about it. Tell Sage and Adam they can have Planarch for the Kickstarter.<br/>7. Run the djinn scenario at GoPlayNW, where it totally sucks. Feel really bad, like I'm the worst designer in the world. But also run a great Legend of Korra game, so maybe everything isn't totally terrible. Worried about being able to make it work for the Kickstarter.<br/>8. Completely reject structured scenarios. Create random-roll jobs table and some bits.<br/>9. Run the new version for Lukas/David and at an SGSeattle meetup. It's WAY WAY better.<br/>10. Start digging into layout and writing for real. Keep playtesting the game semi-regularly.<br/>11. Find an editor to go through it. Julia does a great job. I start finalizing the text. <br/>12. Make a lot of really painful decisions about how to organize the various pages in the booklet. Be not completely satisfied with the final result.<br/>13. Work with Tony Dowler on the interior maps.<br/>14. Send drafts to Sage and Adam. They don't provide feedback but give a lot of encourangement.<br/>15. Eventually get a version that I like.<br/><br/>Throughout the process, the things I worked on were not systematic at all. I did some work on whatever part I was most interested in. Generally finalizing 1-2 pages an evening or maybe more on weekends (like 4-5 pages). I did most of the writing in InDesign so I could make sure I could fit all the content on those small 200-word pages for Scoutbooks. When writing I tried to draw heavily on my own experiences, expertise as an international studies researcher, and my strong beliefs and ideals about multiculturalism and diversity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408922/#Comment_408922" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T12:28:02+00:00" title="March 13, 2013 12:28PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot a step that's like "steal and codify a bunch of stuff about the way John Harper runs World of Dungeons."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408923/#Comment_408923" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T12:31:49+00:00" title="March 13, 2013 12:31PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2013 12:32PM by MatrixGamer.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said above, I start off with the idea of a mechanic. Often I'm playing around with variations on a mechanic (my Matrix game obsession is a point of example - one that I'm starting to break!)Much of this process is just thinking. I jot notes down on a pad I carry around everywhere. <br/><br/>Recently the next step has been making art. I'm doing card games so there is a LOT of art needed. I enjoy doing this and the art comes out fast so this is a joy. This is where my obsessive energy comes in. The art is part of the vision of the whole game that I get at the start. If I don't have the whole game envisioned the process stops with the jotted notes. <br/><br/>Once I've got the art together I sit down and write the rules. The rules are all variations on rules I've written before so the writing goes fast. My rules are VERY short (they fit on the back of ten cards) so I'm not doing a lot of writing. In this way the games are really not RPGs but more board games. As I've grown older I find I want to write less and less - which I think is a good thing. I'm no literature writer. Instead I'm using the art to convey the color of the game. We'll see this year if this works. Usually my experiments don't work but they are fun to make and don't cost too much so... I'll keep doing them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408973/#Comment_408973" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T19:52:32+00:00" title="March 13, 2013  7:52PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2013 7:56PM by zircher.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans_c-o wrote: <br/>&gt; (this is a cool thread, but lemme put in a humble request: share more of your actual design process.<br/>&gt; Like, there are a lot of jumps from step to step here, but what does it look like, day in, day out? <br/>&gt; Are you writing?

Create an outline of how I want to describe the game.<br/>- 4. Fill out the framework, perhaps doing initial layout and some graphics along the way.<br/><br/>Well, between those two steps is where the sausage is made.  The outline is my way of brainstorming and assembling the various parts into something that resembles a game.  It helps me to make sure that I don't forget important bits and establishes the order that the material is presented.  It also forms the basic table of contents.  The outline provides milestones and gives me a feel for how big of a project it is going to be.<br/><br/>Filling out the frame work is hack work where I set up the style, layout, and 'voice' that I'm going to use for the project.  I normally develop in MS Word and actually try to write close to what I think the final form is going to be (there in no raw text version.)  This step also helps with establishing art requirements because I can see where I'll have an empty column for a half page illo or some small filler art to properly end a section of text.  If the style/voice that I'm going for includes side bars, I'll also lay them out and work on their text.<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
