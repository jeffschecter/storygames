Because I can't resist screwing with stuff, I decided to put together a love-and-death-in-the-time-of-steampunk scenario loosely inspired by the look of Jade Empire.  I pictured Heaven City as a sort of Hong Kong sans Britain, but that only really came through in some of the (awesome) sets the players came up with.<br/><br/>I came up with a cast of six characters (two per faction) and gave them names and connections, but very little beyond that.  Then I ran through the game once with some Portland friends to see how it would go.  After a slow start, it really picked up, and in fact the game finished at a much more interesting moment than my initial R-map had provided.  I liked it so much that I canonized the group's input and took the setup almost exactly as they left it to GPNW, where the existing tension and imminent conflict made for another great game!<br/><br/>The factions in play (as MRG recommends) would be the up-and-coming Mechanists' Guild, the politely-named-KGB-analog Imperial Tailors, and the neutral but popular Temple of Seven Steps.  The Mechanists are introducing new wonders of convenience and beauty to the populace, a fact the Tailors strongly dislike, as any change to the status quo means that their ancient web of control is weakening.  The Temple enjoys enough grassroots support that, were it to endorse either side, that faction would have won a near-decisive battle for the future of the city.<br/><br/>Cast of characters follows, sort of like I wrote them up for the Portland group:\n<ul><li><b>Swan</b> is a woman in her early 20s, brilliant and ambitious, who conceals her sex to join the male-only Tailors.  She fights with a beautiful sword.</li>\n<li><b>Fei-Li</b> is Swan's older sister, a rapidly rising Mechanist; she's short-tempered, hardworking, protective and vulnerable.  She fights with a huge wrench.  She's also trying to conceal a dangerous crush on...</li>\n<li><b>Lon Lao</b>, a sharp, charismatic journeyman Tailor in his mid-20s who enjoys a friendly rivalry with Swan--and is starting to suspect something is different about her.  He fights with knives.  He recently discovered that the mother who gave him up for adoption is...</li>\n<li><b>Chalcedony</b>, a mysterious Master Mechanist of middle age who sheathes herself in metal, including a half-mask of bronze.  For reasons unspecified, she knows Swan's secret.  She fights with her armor.</li>\n<li><b>Toh</b> is an innocent teenaged novice at the Temple; Lon Lao is his cousin and his only living relative.  He fights with bells.  Everybody wants to be his friend, because he often assists...</li>\n<li><b>No-Name</b>, middle-aged Watcher Monk of the Temple, who is known to be its tacit decision-maker.  Were his neutrality to shift in favor of either the Tailors or the Mechanists, the people of Heaven City would follow.  He fights with his open hands.</li></ul>\nThere were only four of us in the first game, so we mostly left Chalcedony and No-Name out.  I played Fei-Li, Kyle played Lon Lao, Harry played Swan and Hans played Toh.  They came up with most of the above relationship material (and with their Weather, Colors and Quirks, which I don't have handy).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277394/#Comment_277394" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T16:30:54+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  4:30PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said, the game started a bit slowly; we had to kind of feel out how to drive conflict in the opening scene without being able to make explicit demands or requests.  We actually escalated from Covered to Unsheathed and then went to Wirework all in that scene, but it took us a while to get used to our options at each stage of the knife ritual.  This game needs a flowchart!<br/><br/>We began with Lon Lao visiting Toh in an attempt to convert him into an asset--just as Fei-Li arrived to do the same thing, and tried to eavesdrop.  Not being a spy, she soon revealed herself (halfway up a tree), and she and Lon Lao battled over whether she would tell him who she was and what she wanted.  I believe he won, and she admitted her name and fled, but the real effect of the battle was on Toh--who developed a blinding infatuation for the woman with the wrench.  Instant love triangle!<br/><br/>This game was almost a week ago, so I'm having trouble remembering details; I hope some of the players will stop by to contribute below.  I know that Swan and Fei-Li argued about Swan's career in the Tailors, and whether she needed protection; Lon Lao and Toh got into a semi-playful fight over Fei-Li, knives ringing off bells in the public market; and that Lon Lao eventually manipulated Fei-Li into challenging Chalcedony for her Master's seat (partly to destabilize the Guild, and partly as revenge for her abandonment).  Fei-Li won that Wirework, and found in her triumph that most of the other Mechanists frowned upon her ambition.  Meanwhile, Swan and Toh were watching; Toh was stunned by the violence of the mechanical battle, and Swan was able to draw out his feelings and convert him into an asset of her own.  The game ended with a moonlit confrontation between Lon Lao and Fei-Li on a rooftop, where she accused him of manipulating her--a charge he didn't deny--and demanded to know if he was going to kiss her or what.<br/><br/>I know Swan did more than this in the game, but I also remember thinking her character kind of got short shrift--sorry about that, Harry.  However, the situation as it stood then was much more dynamic and precarious than the original setup:  Fei-Li a new Master in a disapproving guild, Lon Lao frustrated and murky about his loyalties, Swan about to exploit a confused and shaken Toh, and Chalcedony dethroned but burning for vengeance.  I carried all that forward into my setup for the GPNW game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277395/#Comment_277395" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T16:31:05+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  4:31PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2010 4:40PM by Brendan.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This time we had a full table:  I played No-Name, John played Toh, Jordan played Swan, Dawn played Fei-Li, Steve played Chalcedony, and Lee played Lon Lao.  This time we had a nice, huge, beautiful knife courtesy of Harry (in the first game we used a multitool with a blade, which felt genre-appropriate but wasn't the best stabber).<br/><br/>Again, it took us a little while to work out how to arrange our words and make requests via the knife ritual, particularly with regard to when the knife goes where (do I have to escalate or can I make a counterdemand at the same level?  does just saying anything and handing it back constitute a counterdemand, or are my words more constrained?).  I'd sort of expected that with another new group, though.  I think we again went to wirework in the first scene, but I hope some of you guys will correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Chalcedony fought Toh to a standstill over the chance to speak to No-Name, while Swan and Fei-Li had tea and traded veiled barbs about their life growing up as compared to the present.  (Nice touch by Dawn:  she later sent Fei-Li a set of new teacups with a gear-and-cog pattern.)  At Toh's plea, No-Name was drawn out of his isolation and offered to meet Fei-Li and Lon Lao by night on an island atop a waterfall to decide his allegiance.  We tried a sort-of-three-way Wirework sequence for that, which was a little awkward--I knew perfectly well that the rules recommend against it, and I should have handled it better, but it ended nicely with No-Name being driven off the falls into the mist, and a confused, shamed Lon Lao and Fei-Li wondering exactly who won.<br/><br/>Chalcedony sought out an old ally named Pen in the slums and found that a huge mechanical beast of her own design was waiting for her:  a means by which to destroy the Tailors and earn back her place in the Guild.  Swan was watching, and sent warning to Fei-Li, even as Toh stalked her across the city.  But Chalcedony met Swan in her own home and demanded, with one last attempt at a peaceful win for the Mechanists, that she persuade No-Name to shun the Tailors.<br/><br/>Swan refused, of course, which led to a fight that involved a lot of trying to get Swan's pants off.  Chalcedony won in the end, smashing Swan into a pool at the bottom of the falls, which revealed her REAL secret:  she was a clockwork cyborg!  As the water in her works made her slowly grind to a halt, Chalcedony wept over her body, realizing that her selfishness had destroyed a work of amazing mechanical beauty.  (This was a shocking moment in several ways, not least when Jordan actually took the "accept the demand, and die" option in response to having his character sheet stabbed.  His dying wish was for Fei-Li and Lon Lao to BOTH die, which we didn't actually get around to doing.)<br/><br/>Chalcedony went to call off Pen, but he had already gone mad with devotion and was rampaging across the city in her mecha-beast.  Toh, Fei-Li and Lon Lao finally managed to stop him together, and agreed that this war had caused too much damage:  the Tailors and Mechanists had to cooperate, and the Temple would support them both.<br/><br/>We did a nice round of quick epilogue scenes, including Fei-Li gently helping Toh from the wreckage and giving him a smile and the first signs of recognition.  The most memorable to me, though, was Lon Lao being promoted to Master Tailor and sitting alone after the celebration, weeping because all his ambition hadn't earned his mother's love.<br/><br/>It was an immensely satisfying conclusion to me (though we didn't have a chance to touch on Fei-Li's grief for her sister), followed by a nice group dinner where we got to decompress and talk a bit about the game.  If I find the time, I'll write the stage-2 scenario up as a set of PDF character sheets and post them here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277404/#Comment_277404" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T18:02:53+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  6:02PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a great time, and loved the texture of passing the knife.  <br/><br/>Only thing that I can see is that you didn't mention the second scene: Lon Lau and Fei-Li in the tea house, where Lon Lau tried to distance himself from Fei-Li, who had an unrequited love for him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277699/#Comment_277699" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T11:54:32+00:00" title="June 24, 2010 11:54AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2010 11:55AM by John_Powell.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a great time playing the lovesick Toh, and the minor character, Pen, the crazy assistant that finished the <b>Harmonious Blossom of Retribution</b> (a gigantic steam-powered spider-mech) and rampaged across the city.<br/><br/>Thanks again for facilitating this game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor" title="vae_editor"><img alt="vae_editor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor">vae_editor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278098/#Comment_278098" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T19:17:19+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  7:17PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had an incredible time playing Swan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
