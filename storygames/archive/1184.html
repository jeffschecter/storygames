                    Sorry to crosspost, but I would like to get this out to as many people as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a fairly new D&amp;D gamer (about two years). I started gaming with my husband and a few of our friends. There are four women that game in the group and my daughter also wants to join the group now. I stayed behind for this year's GenCon (pregnancy induced bed rest) and browsed the Internet. I found the Ladies of Hack and was excited that there was some where for female gamers to go and hang out. I told my friends and they all want to order the Ladies of Hack shirts. The Ladies had a meet and greet during GenCon and it sparked some excitement, especially when Meguey Baker and Emily Care Boss joined them. <br/>
<br/>
So, I've jumped on the bandwagon to try to help get a more visual appearance at GenCon Indy 2007. Meguey Baker suggested posting on several different boards for ideas on where to start. I guess the first thing to ask is what do female gamers want to see at the convention for them? For that matter, what would male gamers like to see at GenCon in support of female gamers?<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas I've thought of:<br/>
<br/>
Booth with female game designers, DMs, etc. Yes, there are women in gaming!<br/>
<br/>
Female oriented t-shirts. Something that shows a little more respect for women than two d20's and the caption, "yes these are natural across" the chest of the shirt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know there have been seminars in the past regarding women in gaming, but I haven't seen anyone post any follow up on any of the seminars and the last time I looked, they had very low registration.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hear more thoughts, suggestions, etc. I AM going to GenCon Indy 2007 and I would love to see something to encourage and support women in gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Stepping down from the soapbox. Next up?<br/>

                            Okay, so we need something that can be high profile and well advertised... How about a Miss D&amp;D/gamer contest? LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a battle of the sexes? A Female DM with Male gamers and a Male DM with Female gamers?<br/>
<br/>
How many of the advertisements were there this year showing women trying to get to GenCon? The ones that come to mind for me all involved men getting wrapped up in a package for the mail or riding a tricycle. But I wasn't paying much attention to the ads until recently.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think the seminars offered "for the better half" pulled women away from the gaming. Maybe there should be a seminar titled "What's the big deal?" for women to try a bit of gaming. Or we could call it "A no thank you bite." LOL. I use that to get my children to at least try something before they go ahead and turn it down. <br/>
<br/>
Then there could be "Miss/Myth Busters" to make women aware of what gaming can be, since it can be anything you want. Gaming is not for just for women trying to be sexy (although that seems to be what men want out of women gaming). Like the characters displayed at the LadiesofHack.com website, women gamers come in all sort of sizes and personalities. Yeah, there are times I want to be the sexy female paladin that kicks some butt, but there are other times when I just want to be a party member and valued for what I can contribute to the party, regardless of what sex I am.                        </div>

                            What do I know ... but I don't think focusing on women as unique or marginalized is a good idea.  We're all gamers, and mixed gender games are, in my experience, better games.  That's what is awesome about encouraging women to roleplay - it's enlightened self interest as far as I'm concerned.  <br/><br/>There are, no doubt, gender issues at the table, and maybe some women would find an all-female table more fun, less problematic, I don't know exactly.  So on one extreme, sessions specifically designed for and run by women might be a draw.    That's cool if the need is there, but ultimately I don't think it is super healthy as a conscious choice.  Marginalization and all that - but if it creates a fun, safe place for people to try stuff out, rock on.  <br/><br/>One thing that's cool is how the dynamic changes when you break out of the "lone female gamer" thing and have a more equitable ratio of players.  So maybe a positive step would be to coordinate to make this happen - set up some communication to ensure that pairs and trios of women are signing up for the same events.  More fun for everybody!  Go play!  <br/><br/>Just some thoughts.                        </div>

                            I have to weigh in with Annie and Jason on this one.  Having a stronger female presence at GenCon would be awesome, but I think putting female game designers and players on a pedestal makes them something extra special and rare instead of something normal.  One of the most powerful tools in feminist activism, in my opinion, is inviting a bunch of cool women to be a part of a traditionally male activity (like roleplaying or GenCon) and then not making a big deal about them being women.  Because why the hell <i>shouldn't</i> they be a part of it?  This is what I did in finding people from underrepresented groups to work on <i>Push</i> (in regards to  women, people of color, and folks from abroad) and it enables you to seduce people into giving up their prejudices, because you aren't necessarily in their faces with all this progressive politiking (which turns many people off and prevents them from listening to your message).  You're just presenting stuff that rocks, which happens to be by a different set of voices than they normally get to hear from.<br/><br/>So I'd suggest something more along the lines of organizing events that are about subjects other than "women in gaming" and having women be in charge of running them or be major participants in the seminars or whatever.  Because otherwise it sounds like women are only able to speak about being women, while men can speak about all sorts of different things.  Sure, they can bring up stuff about being a woman in a largely male hobby, but I think it'd be cool to give women a forum where they can speak authoritatively on roleplaying in general.  Just my two cents.                        </div>

                            Hey, Sephera! Nice to see you here.<br/><br/>I agree that visiblity at major cons is a good starting place just as much as in your local gaming store. The thing that makes big cons not "the last mile of this particular equation" is the sheer number of people who potentially will see the event/shirt/panel/whatever. I saw three folks wearing rose-colored "Gay-mer" shirts. I totally remember them, and it made me more aware of the broad cross-section of cultures at a con. If there were more shirts like my "RPG:role playing girl" shirt and the Ladies of Hack shirts, there'd be more visibility. Vincent just thought of and wants: "Some of my characters are women"
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sephera</cite>Maybe there should be a seminar titled "What's the big deal?" for women to try a bit of gaming... Then there could be "Miss/Myth Busters" to make women aware of what gaming can be, since it can be anything you want.</blockquote>
A panel, well advertized, would be awesome. I think both these would be great.

The need is there. Women-only space is radical. Here's how: if you (meaning 'men', not 'Jason') set up a room at GenCon for women only, then also gave that room the crappiest lighting, uncomfortable chairs, incomplete dice sets, broken pencils, and only the backs of last year's flyers for paper, *that* would be marginalizing. If you then got a man to 'go run for the girls' that'd be patrononizing as well. <br/><br/>If, on the other hand, it was a room like any other room, and women could play anything they wanted, lead by other women, it'd rock. I'd run my game, Emily'd run hers, Annie might run hers, maybe Danielle would run MLWM, maybe Emily'd run SAH-Roach, etc. etc. It would be solid awesome gaming in a setting where women who might have a need or desire for women-only space could get it.<br/><br/>For the  record, there was a woman who had dug her way to GenCon in the ads, and I think another woman too.<br/>A "Battle of the Sexes" makes me cringe. That's the antithesis of what I'd want to see. Ditto the Miss D&amp;D (just typing it I'm seeing 'Miss Double D' in my head). There's a difference between <i>including</i> women and <i>attracting</i> women. We (meaning game designers and players and con-goers and etc) can be as inclusive as we want, but if it's not also attractive, it's not going to happen.                        </div>

                            While I do think the whole 'women game too -- golly gee!' thing is not a great topic for a seminar, the idea of a women-only space sounds like a great idea. I am thinking particularly of what Meguey wrote about in a recent post, about how some women gamers find themselves creating a gamer identity that is based largely around how they relate to the males in the group/to ideas about men in gaming, etc. One advantage of a women-only space would be that it removes (or at least mitigates) this temptation/crutch/problem/thing, which seems like it could help women who are used to that sort of social dynamic get a taste of what it's like to game without constantly having to worry about your position in relation to male players. (Not that a women-only space would guarantee this; after all, men don't have to be in the room to be in the room, as it were. But it seems like an opportunity to get past that, at the same time.)<br/><br/>Back to seminars -- I think some real, thoughtful seminars that seriously address issues of gender and gaming are the way to go. Ideally with lots of promotion and attendance -- but I think you'll get a more positive effect if these seminars are interesting in their own right, not only as a political stance or as a novelty. There's certainly no shortage of topics to talk about that either directly address these issues or related issues -- I'd love to see a panel on playing opposite-gender characters, for example.                        </div>

Perhaps outreach to women at this site and inviting some of their staff to participate in your mission could create a stronger attendee base.  It also might give insight to how they approach issues in other convention/gaming venues. That's one idea.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps having an "Amazon" event.  Where female GMs run a story in whatever genre that has strictly females as PCs.<br/>

<code>but I think putting female game designers and players on a pedestal makes them something extra special and rare instead of something normal. </code><br><br>I couldn't have said that any better.  It's true.  It should be something normal.  So the question exists, did anyone stop by to see what they were doing in the "better half" events?  I was running a bunch of games myself and never got the chance to run over and check it out but I was told they played some games.  <br><br>And I'm with Lxndr too, I'd be sad if there were women-only areas and that's the only place that the women gamed as well as if there were men-only areas and that's only were the men gamed.  All that's going to do is remind us of our differences and force us all apart.  Also that is counter to what gaming is all about. It would tell people that they are not allowed and not welcome when all we ever try to do at our tables is make people part of the game and feel welcome.<br><br>Just my two cents.<br><br>Lisa P                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think that there are good reasons for the ambivalency in this thread. <br><br>On the one hand, we all want more women in gaming. On the other hand, nobody wants to see it accomplished in a way that heightens the perception of there being a problem playing in mixed gender groups. <br><br>This reminds me of Curves (<a href="http://www.curvesinformation.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.curvesinformation.com/</a>), the "women-only" gym. As I understand it, there are two reasons for the existence of Curves. First, that women have unique fitness needs, and so having a place that specializes in them is a good idea. But there's a second reason, which is that many women don't like to be oogled in gyms, which is  a common phenomenon. I think that the fact that it's done in part defensively is sad. <br/><br/>That is, if the only reason that the space exists is to make women more comfortable, then the problem is that we're not making them more comfortable in the regular games we play. In this case, then Jason would be right, we'd be solving the problem incorrectly. I'm not going to make a claim one way or the other about the games we run at GenCon. Instead I'll ask the female gamers here - are they comfortable to play in? Yeah, go ahead and comment on the difference between games run by the Forge crowd and those run by the general public if there's a difference. <br/><br/>Because if, in fact, Meg and others like her are comfortable playing with the men, then her support of special female games has to be based on something else. You and I, Jason, may not be able to determine what that is, so it might make it look like the subtextual reason for the existence of Curves. But if your wife, Meg, and other women see some value in it that's not simply male avoidance, then it's got to be a good thing. <br/><br/>Alex's point is good as a general thing, but it's got his own biases within it. That is, I'd hate to see the women do women-only gaming, too, but that's because I like playing with women (heck, I go out of my way to get female players). I'd think that most women would want to play with men, too, but if they didn't for some reason, well, that's their own damn right to play with whomever they wish (I tend to reserve the right for men to play intentionally witn men-only, too, as long as it's a well-examined idea, and not simply hidden misogyny). I don't think you can say objectively that mixed gender is better than not, I think it's just the most common preference. <br/><br/>Given that it seems to be the most common preference, even for women, I find it odd that women would want single-gender games. But, again, I'm not going to even ask why, but just say that as long as it's not hiding from the men, that we should put it together. Nothing about it would force players like Lisa to participate anyhow.<br/><br/>I have to say that I'm skeptical that it would have a high impact - a seminar or two and a few sessions of play is a drop in the bucket at GenCon, as is just about any other event that a single group can run. If you really wanted high impact, you'd want to get WotC aboard with this at the very least. If not figure out some way to create a network event that was bought into by a lot of companies. <br/><br/>On the other hand, every little bit counts. If even one more female gamer attends than would have, it's a step in the right direction, IMO. <br/><br/>Meg, others, I'd be interested to hear what you would say in such a seminar. Could you give a bullet point overview of what such a seminar might contain? That might shed some light. <br/><br/>I think that the "Gamer Widow" tracks exist for women who are, quite simply, not in the Gamer tribe. That is, I think that they don't feel excluded because they're women, they feel excluded because they don't know who Cthulhu is. So when somebody shoves a plushy Cthulhu under their noses, they just don't see what a wonderful thing that is. It's just the world's ugliest plushy to them. They can't recite Monty Python. They don't even know what "Dee-twenty" is. So that track exists so that they can socialize with normies, or just to have something to do while their gamer husbands mix with the tribe. Doesn't really matter what it is that they do. I understand at one Origins version, they tautght knitting, and it was a big success. <br/><br/>Now, I think that most such folks might be a bit more comfortable at Forge events, because we tend to push the "gamer vibe" a little less (I've been known not to show up on Game-dar, when shaven). But I'm not sure it's quite enough to get them out of the protective creche of their track, and out into the general gamer population. We could certainly try, however. <br/><br/>Mike                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Mike, when women roleplay, they always have mixed gender games, with extremely rare exceptions like <i>Bitches in the Vineyard</i> (and, even there, Brand's GMing).  When men play, they often have all-male games and sometimes have mixed gender games.  You see the difference there?  It's not about women "not wanting to play with men."  It's that they always play with men.  Which is why female-only spaces are radical, not because there are no men but because there are all women. Which seems like slicing grapes, but it's a big difference in perspective.  There are a lot of all-male or predominantly male spaces in the world and quadrupally so at GenCon. Sure, if men see all-female spaces as somehow exclusionary and threatening, in many ways <i>that's kinda the point</i>; they are subversive and pretty dern awesome for that.  But this probably isn't the place to discuss this, really, so I'll leave it at that.                        </div>

                            What if we set up a booth somewhere that sells <i>good</i> chocolate, teas, coffee, fruit, and has tables, and call it something like "Eve's Garden"?  Have smaller tables where people can sit.  The goal of this is to give people a space to socialize that isn't gaming-oriented.  I'm trying to figure out how to make it attractive to women in particular, to give them a public, social space to gather and talk while at the con.  This doesn't directly address the women-in-gaming issue, but it would create a bonding space.<br/><br/>This sort of thing could be done equally as well by normally-dressed women wandering around and giving a chocolate to any woman she sees, telling them about chill space, a seminar, or really just connecting with other women.  "You are not alone.  There are more of us!"  Maybe turn it into a pass-it-on thing?  I feel like I've gone off the deep end, now....  :P<br/><br/>My goal in these ideas is to make women aware of the other women in gaming.  My reaction is still "Oh wow!  Another woman!"  If women became more aware of the other women, it could help a lot.  Especially since women tend to move in packs.  So if we know other women, we could go do things in packs, which makes others more aware of us as a group....  What do you think?<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

                            What if rather than have women only spaces, we have a women in gaming space? I think there was a special room for minis, a room for board games, a room for card type games, room for anime, etc. this past year. How are those not segregating? Why would a women in gaming space be segregating. It could use games designed by females or games run by female DMs or something like that. Women AND men would be welcome in the space, but it might also give women a space where they feel like a little less intimidated.                        </div>

I'd like to talk about Playing Across Gender, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16661.0" rel="nofollow">Ritual in Game/Game Design</a>, and <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=32" rel="nofollow">Nobody Gets Hurt vs. I Will Not Abandon You</a>. Those are things I feel really comfortable talking about, and would like to see wider discussion around. Now, obviously Playing Across Gender would directly address gender issues, but the other topics do, too. It's just not in the same vein as "Women game too!"<br/><br/>Jonathan's answer to 'why have women-only space' is exactly as I would have said.<br/><br/>I think Nancy's idea of a "You are not alone. There are more of us!" meme is cool, and I think stickers or pins, which are visible, would be great. Kind of like the Forge stickers were this year.                        </div>

                            Check out ConBust (yes, they chose the name as a joke) over at Smith College in Northampton, MA. Smith is a womens' college, and the con has (in its short history) always had a definite slant towards female creators and issues without any moronic "war of the sexes" bullshit. They had Ms. Borgstrom a few years ago, and I was very sad that I wasn't able to be there for that. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> It's a small con, but it was well-run the last time I was there.

                            I agree with what Mike said.  I do not have problems gaming with men in general and do not need GenCon activities to deal with that.  As far as a seminar, I would much rather see more women participating in existing seminar topics (like rpg theory, design, etc.) or one of the topics that Meg mentioned rather than a generic woman centered seminar.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not one for single-sex groups or spaces, although I won't deny those who would want that.  I do think it would be keen to have a no camera zone at the con.                        </div>

I clipped out a whole bunch... but I wanted to comment on this thought.  I've been a GM and an organizer since the mid Eighties, and have introduced a lot of women to gaming.  Women who might not have otherwise tried gaming; women who had resisted gaming because of their encounters with the worst Gaming Guys <sup>TM</sup> have to offer.<br/><br/>I've run all female games, and I've run mixed games (mostly the latter).  I lack the biological design to run an all male game, but I've often been the only woman at the table.  The all female games were a very different mental space.  I would be soooo willing to help out in a Women's Space gaming area, especially if we're going out of our way to entice women who don't usually game, or who don't game for their own sakes.<br/><br/>I'm just sayin'...                        </div>

                            This may be at a tangent to the main thread, but I just wanted to report an observation my (non-gamer, although highly knowledgeable and sympathetic to my hobby) girlfriend made the other day. <br/><br/>We'd been out for the evening to a Samba night with some of my gamer friends and it was the first time she'd met them. At one point we got chatting about games and she was asked whether she gamed, why she didn't game and what it would take to get her to game. This was all perfectly conversational and by no means aggressive or confrontational.<br/><br/>I didn't think any more of it at the time, but on the way home she commented that she felt vaguely offended by that line of questioning and the implication that she should game because I gamed. She said that she didn't try to convert me or my friends to embroidery, so why should gamers always insist on trying to convert her to gaming?<br/><br/>Not sure what to take from this except to say that she does have a good point. Maybe I'll come back to this in the morning and see if I have anything inciteful to add.                        </div>

I think it probably depends on how it's done, but I always make sure to extend the invitation to our gamers' S.O.s, so they know this is not a secret private club where the rest of us hide from them.  I wnat them to feel welcomed if they want to try RPGs, not intimidated because we're all old hands at it and they're not.

I read that some time ago and have never been able to decide whether it's an awkward attempt at humor or some really bizarre bitterness against women showing through. Never been able to find it funny because I have a friend who talks like that. Bad experience with a woman turned him bitter and cynical against that half of the species, though I don't seem to count because I'm a <i>person</i> to him. Strange creatures, men.<br/><br/>Anyway, back on topic. Sounds great! Is the extent of my inspiring and insightful input. Zero experience with cons and will be out of the country over the summer, but I wanted to show my support.                        </div>

<p>Very minor data point:</p>
<p>On the Swedish con scene in the early 2000s, a band of feminist women players for a long string of cons would play games as a women-only player group.</p>
<p>(Side-note to reduce cultural confusion: Swedish cons traditionally let you sign up not as an individual, but as a gaming group of 4-5 players.)</p>
<p>So this group'd have either their own GM among them (who'd run the scenario that the con's game-slot afforded them), or they'd scrounge up a decent, male GM person to run it. A most definite women-only space. (Alas, it was a close-knit group, not an open-to-all-women invitation.)</p>
<p>Most of them organize con games otherwise. Their moniker was Superbabes (yes, tongue-in-cheek).</p>

                            I don't know what folks perceptions are, but to me it seemed like at Forge Midwest this year we had a better percentage of women to men than the previous year. I only participated in one game slot that was all guys, compared to about 50% of my games last year being all guys. Why the change?<br/>
<br/>
So one of the things I like about the indie roleplaying scene / movement / phenomena is that anyone who wants to struggle through the process of designing a game can. I think this will lead to more women being involved naturally. Maxis, the home of the Sims, is probably the most successful video game design company. You don't see as much about their stuff in video game magazines, or websites, as say the first person shooter of the month, but sales-wise they have very little competition. This is because they tap a market that is less served by the somewhat male dominated video game media. (I don't think males are actually as dominant numerically as believed in the video game player area.) Maxis employs around 50% females which is out of line with the rest of the industry. Lo and behold women design games they like.<br/>
<br/>
I think that we've seen some really good roleplaying games from females that do different things than we've seen before. We've had some really great breaths of fresh air from Emily Care Bosses, "Breaking the Ice," and, "Shooting the Moon." Meguey Baker's "1001 nights," and Annie Rushes, "Run Robot Red", "The Secret Lives of Gingerbread Men" , and "House of Horiku." We have more games coming, and more women designers getting involved. I think that as more females see these successes and get into the process of game creation we will naturally see more women in roleplaying. At least in the Indie sphere. So for me the question is more; do we presently have a place that's accepting of women as designers? I don't know the answer.                        </div>

Anyone have the numbers?  <br><br>A while back, in an LJ <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/25212.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Including Women Gamers</b></a>, I reflected on comparison of attendance for gatherings.  According to Matt Wilson, there were around 1/7th women at the prior Forge Midwest (6 or 7 out of 50).  (This roughly matches my experience of indie game gatherings in the Bay Area, like the EndGame minicons.)  I estimated that my local mid-sized cons had around 1/6th.  GenCon SoCal 2005 supposedly had 1/4th women (23%).  Knutepunkt in Sweden had around 1/3, and AmberCon NorthWest had around 45%.                        </br></br></div>
