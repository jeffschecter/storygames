What do you do to make it interesting?<br/><br/>Here are some of the ideas I've been toying with so far:<br/><br/>- A communal character creation session before everything kicks off. <br/>- Everybody has to list three people that their character knows and three places that their character has been<br/>- I want to run the entire story of 'How did you meet, why are you adventuring together' as a big skill challenge and to give the players a lot of control over it<br/>- I'm tweaking all the races a little bit and emphasising the aspects that really turn me on, like the ancient legacy aspect of the dragonborn and tieflings, the piety of the dwarves, etc<br/>- I bought myself a vinyl battlemat and I'm going to use abstract counters for the combats, as well as printing out cards with all the powers and abilities for easy reference<br/><br/>Just all the simple stuff that makes 4e work. I've been a bit cold on it so far, so this is me attempting to impress both my players and myself.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218487/#Comment_218487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T11:09:57+00:00" title="July 15, 2009 11:09AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sold on the use of a printed avatar (ideally with color) pasted onto a mosaic tile (or something similar) for moving things on the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218498/#Comment_218498" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T11:30:22+00:00" title="July 15, 2009 11:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really emphasize the effect of terrain on battles.

Communal character creation is key.  I adapted Falling Blossoms clan burner and did:<br/>-A person they love or are related to, but have a tricky relationship with<br/>-A place they want to see (one for each player)<br/>-A key point about their race's past<br/>-A pressing problem that cannot be ignored<br/>-A monster involved in evil going on<br/>-A villain involved in the evil going on<br/><br/>For all of it, I loosely defined a world. One specific location, the starting city, the primary point of light. And two big problem areas, an evil empire and a corrupt boomtown. Everything else, including which races populated all these areas (or the world itself) was left up in the air, based entirely on the player's choices. For example, no one chose a dragonborn, so I'm not even sure yet if they exist in the world. And the races that did get picked, it was entirely up to the players to define their history and such. So, we have Gensai, an ancient but almost extinct race; Tieflings, long oppressed now seek revenge by gaining power within the evil empire; warforged are non-sentient golems, except for one (the PC obviously) who is on a spirital quest to exalt all warforged (he's a paladin); and so on.<br/><br/>One key thing I do is liberal use of Skill Challenges with two main flavors. One flavor is very fast, very little input, to keep a quick pace. This is great for action oriented ones, like searching the streets for a contact, or running away from a dragon.  The other is very flexible, allowing the players to get creative and change the flow of the game. I give them a lot more narrative control here. Succcesses means what they want happens, the main confine is the overall goal of the skill challenge. They need to work toward that, but can't accomplish that until the final success. But I apply indie game lessons of stake setting and player authority over storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218518/#Comment_218518" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T11:59:17+00:00" title="July 15, 2009 11:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wizards is now still doing the test drive bit @ <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4dnd/dndtestdrive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4dnd/dndtestdrive</a><br/><br/>As for my Suggestions (or rather what I would do)<br/><br/>A&gt; Go with the Pregens, communal character creation is fine I think in games where its quick to make characters. I wouldn't call it quick to make 4th edition characters (not bad but not quick) the pregens also have the benefit of having all the math already done, and I found the batch of level 2 pregens in Kybers Harvest to be really well laid out in that , new to dnd, sense.<br/><br/>B&gt; If your designing the encounters yourself, go with a soft sell. The rules say level -7 to level +4 but from experiance I would say that most if not all monsters should be level or lower. Remember to include terrain/traps/obstacles/neat fiddley bits at least every other encounter. It helps break up the encounter and make them more interesting which is win win. <br/><br/>C&gt; If your playing with people with complete newbitis, Do the Final Fantasy Introduction that was talked about in the other thread. Its honestly so smart that I am now sad that I haven't done it when I had the chance. Make sure to hit , Attacks, Defenses, Skills, and Conditions as this is really 90% of the game I find. <br/><br/>D&gt; Stay away from Magic Items for the first n levels. Most Magic Items either modify powers or give you new powers and they can be a bit overwealming paperworkwise and underwealming effect wise at the begining. <br/><br/>E&gt;If you like the whole story nowish (but not really) sort of thing, I could suggest john wick's dirty Dungeon @ <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-dsnvANYBRWo?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvANYBRWo"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/dsnvANYBRWo/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/>If your people like this sort of thing (and chances are if your going on about communal character creation their's a good chance they will) it can be really awesome.

Set pieces.  Yeah.  I like to include primary objectives besides kill 'em all.   We've had rescues, town defense scenarios, trials by combat on moving ice floes, rotating room puzzles, kidnapping defenses, and a couple plain ol' dungeon crawls. <br/><br/>I hate battles that are irrelevant to the fiction.  There should be a good reason to draw blades and go mortal.<br/><br/>I like placing risky subobjectives with tasty rewards in the middle of things, to distract players from the main objective.  Like putting a treasured NPC in the middle of a battle and offering a big XP reward if he can be escorted to safety.  Or putting powerful treasure in a burning building.  Or putting the lightly guarded enemy command post on display at the edge of the battle, with its wealth and treasure plainly visible.  The players didn't go for that last one, alas.<br/><br/>I try to build big-map encounters that are part danger room, part pinball machine, and part jungle gym.  I like elevation, dynamic terrain, and evolving hazards.  Fires spread, ships sink, and chains are for climbing.  I want Athletics and Acrobatics to be rolled regularly.   On at least two occasions, our warlord has spent standard actions tying off a safety line before getting down to some risky Athletics rolling.  If I can provoke an action pointed triple-move round out of a player, then I consider the session a success. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8098&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Here's a writeup on the biggest of those big-map encounters.</a><br/><br/>We have used Hard Boiled Armies by One Bad Egg when we want to scale up our fights to unit level, and this has been fun.  We've also invented <a href="http://forums.gleemax.com/showpost.php?p=19028960&amp;postcount=13" rel="nofollow">a very simple mechanic for PC-scale encounters that take place within a wideer battle. </a><br/><br/>The downside of this approach is that my prep can be really, really involved and is never really completed to my satisfaction before game night. That big encounter I linked to above took me nearly a month to get together.  Luckily the lonely fun of setting up a battlemat on my coffee table and sketching on it and discovering neat ideas is really rewarding for me.  And we also alternate D&amp;D with Mouse Guard, so I've got two weeks between sessions, usually.<br/><br/>The other downside to this approach is that D&amp;D assumes that you'll face a number of small encounters in a working day and have tense decisions to make about resource use across all those encounters.  Concentrating on one big encounter at a time subverts that.  I need to serialize encounters a little bit to get that goodness back in.  I really want to make the players sweat their 'use-my-daily?' decision and their 'extended rest now?' decisions.<br/><br/>Some other general points:<br/><br/>* <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=208329" rel="nofollow">Player-created quests are awesome.</a> <br/><br/>* I try not to create anything that's not instantly relevant to the campaign.  Like when you talk about tweaking races, I don't want to bother with that unless I have a PC or NPC to act that stuff through.  The risk with me and lonely fun like that is that I'll start mixing up what the players know about the setting and what I know about the setting and the bad kind of surprises will follow.<br/><br/>* I like how core D&amp;D gives you a very bare-bones writeup on all its fluff; it's like an invitation to riff on cultures and settings.  And like Alvin, my setting respects any player fluff choice.  Like if a player wanted her star pact warlock to party with a new non-official star of her own invention, that'd be part of the setting.  <br/><br/>* But once that star's written up and in my hands, I will do my best to use it as a complicating factor and not just a merely enabling one.  But always I want to respect the player's vision and if I extend/subvert/pervert the player vision in a way that I worry might not be cool with the player, then I propose it rather than imposing it.  I want to be an ethical evil genie.<br/><br/>* On the tabletop, make all DCs public knowledge so that players can evaluate hypothetical moves without needing to randomize the DM.  I write DCs and special rules directly on the battlemat ahead of time for everyone's reference.  If I have complex special rules, I'll print cards containing the rules for everyone's reference.<br/><br/>* I don't generally call for perception or knowledge rolls unless we're in an encounter.  If I need knowledge to be out at the table I'll just tell the information to the PC with the highest relevant skill bonus.  I never ever use passive perception.<br/><br/>* At my table, I feel a very strong gravity towards the dry, boring rollrollrollrollrolllwin?lose? kind of skill challenge and I'm still working out how to use them best to provoke the good stuff.  Right now I'm not as into skill challenges; I'm moving towards a Mouse Guard philosophy of having large amounts of fiction ride on a single die roll.  If the party at large wants to participate in such a check, then Aid Another works for that.<br/><br/>* That said, buy a DnDi subscription and read the Mike Mearls Dungeon articles on skill challenges.  Skill challenges are kind of like the Western chromatic scale.  They're not a mechanic, they're a thing that you use to make mechanics.  Hopefully the DMG2 is largely composed of Mearls skill challenge articles.  <br/><br/>* We started with H1, Keep on the Shadowfell, and it's dry as dirt, but that was a virtue for us because it's really really easy to riff on it and give it some life.  Beware Irontooth.<br/><br/>* Play God of War on the PS2 and let it fire your imagination.  God of War is really inspirational for me.<br/><br/>* EDIT TO ADD JUST ONE MORE GODDAMNED THING: 4E is pretty whiffy.  The math gives PCs a roughly 50/50 shot at hitting level-appropriate foes, and it's not impossible for someone's dice to go totally cold for a session, which can be very frustrating.  Good PC teamwork can mitigate this somewhat, but I've started reducing the defenses of my monsters a bit to see if the play flows better.  On a related not, be very careful about using soldiers that are leveled above the party; those can be a big drag of endless misses rolls.  I think 13+party level is a good rule of thumb for baseline enemy ACs, but I'm still working this out.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218551/#Comment_218551" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T13:07:54+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  1:07PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>As we go on, I am finding that pointing out terrain/dynamic terrain features is important, often having monsters use it to "demonstrate".

There are these areas of ground marked as weak points: Step there and you tumble into the tunnels and a bunch of young Kruthiks which are just as nasty.<br/><br/>So basically you are walking through this area and you get attacked. That is the encounter. But I kept thinking "How cool would this be if the heroes didn't know what was attacking them?" I kept imagining this ravine filled with tendrils of fog and the heroes not seeing the Kruthiks until they were right next to them (and by then you are taking damage from their auras), not having the option of stepping back and doing distance  attacks, and having a friend in the mists suddenly drop out of sight, just the sound of clawing and biting and screaming coming out of the fog.<br/><br/>And the 4E rules for fog and mist totally back you up on that.

If not, maybe you could hook them with something stock, like the mayor's daughter has been kidnapped. Each player takes turns going though his character's investigation. Fighty characters could use intimidation or something appropriate to cover "getting physical" with people. As the characters approach some threshold of successes, they become aware of each other. The less successful characters stumble into the confrontation, in part due to chance. Then, if you want, you can cliffhanger and pick up next week with the fighting, etc.<br/><br/>Just a thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219311/#Comment_219311" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T12:47:57+00:00" title="July 18, 2009 12:47PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something like that is pretty much what I'm looking for.

If the skill challenge starts in the equivalent of a plain 10-by-10 room you might be getting a lot of blank looks.<br/><br/>So... if I were trying to do something like this, I'd make it something that immediately creates a shared interest, in a colorful setting that everyone can visualize, with some NPCs they can react against.   Kick things off with a bang!<br/><br/>Something like ... the PCs are inmates on a prison ship that is suddenly attacked by minotaur pirates.  You've got sadistic bully guards and a savage minotaur captain as NPCs.  Maybe a sympathetic NPC prisoner.  Oh, and the barge is on fire.  Never mind why they were all on that ship -- they can explain that later.<br/><br/>The goal of the skill challenge is simple and primal: to escape.  If they crap it up, then maybe the ship sinks and they wash up on the Isle of Dread and you can roll into something new from that.  If they do okay, then maybe the minotaur captain puts them off at a friendly port where they are penniless, and you can roll into something new from that.    If they triumph in the skill challenge, then maybe they kill the minotaur captain and take over her ship...<br/><br/>To draw the group together, use the situation to push the characters to demonstrate their mechanical usefulness to the group. Shamelessly target skills to character; find a skill unique to each character and hit that hard in the skill challenge.  Like no one goes anywhere until the rogue can Thievery the locks on their chains, or that the only chance of influencing the minotaur is via the paladin's Diplomacy, or that only someone with the superior Endurance of the fighter can navigate the smoke-filled interior of the ship.

Big time.<br/><br/>That kind of thinking is good for D&amp;D4 in general. In one of the D&amp;D play videos, Andy Collins said something that has stuck with me: "Well, as a good D&amp;D monster, of course I'll do the thing that activates your character's special ability." That is, instead of just playing it like a wargame and "knowing" that a different move was a better tactical choice, Andy played to the strengths of the PC and had the monster make a sub-optimal (but plausible) move in order to fulfill the condition of one of the PC's powers.<br/><br/>A similar thing came up in one of our games. I was playing a Tiefling, and had used my fire resistance to good effect in the first battle. In the next scene, all of the fire-shooting monsters targeted the other heroes. The GM was like, "I'm not gonna waste my time shooting fire at you anymore, since it doesn't do anything." I was deeply disappointed. We talked about how I had chosen the fire resistant character because <i>I wanted to be set on fire</i>. If the GM decided it was a "waste of time" to attack my character with fire, then that key character power was now worthless.<br/><br/>So, yes. Send the fiery monsters after the Tiefling. Send the radiant-vulnerable undead against the Cleric. Play to their strengths. Give them the opportunity to use all of those cool powers they spent so much time carefully selecting. It's not the D&amp;D4 GM's job to meta-strategize and find a way to nullify all of the PC's cool powers. That way lies the suck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219473/#Comment_219473" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-19T14:55:55+00:00" title="July 19, 2009  2:55PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2009 4:17PM by johnzo.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Play to their strengths.

It really comes down to what the players need to have fun.<br/><br/>A couple examples from the game that I DM:<br/><br/>1) I was suprised and dismayed to see what Scorching Burst does to tightly packed minions.  ( <i>Sweet Zombie Christ!  A nine-square at-will vs. Reflex at <b>first level</b></i>\u203d )  It was making minion-heavy encounters boring to me and for a time I thought about not using them anymore.  <br/><br/>That felt like denying a huge part of the game, so I started game planning with them.  I disperse minions whenever I can.  I leave ranged minions in cover.  I hold minion reserves in stealthy concealment until mid-encounter, and I don't commit melee minions decisively until they can get into kissing range of the PCs.  Scorching Burst is still useful, but it's not going to be useful every round in the game, it's not always going to be the decisive thing in a minion-heavy encounter, and sometimes hard decisions will need to be made about its use.  I'm gonna try to make them work for it.<br/><br/>2) We've got a necrotic and radiant resistant deva in our game now.  That ability was really decisive in one encounter. Just like with scorching burst, my first thought was to just change encounters to diminish the power of the ability; I would stop it with the evil clerics and undead for awhile, or change their damage types to get away from this. <br/><br/>What I'll do instead is game-plan around the deva a little bit and avoid hitting him with radiants and necrotics if there's a choice to do otherwise.  This will force him to seek out opportunities to demonstrate his awesomeness.  I think this will work out fine.  The player chose to play an avenger. Seeking is half of the avenger mission statement.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  He's very good at making people not ignore him.<br/><br/>I'm also kinda thinking about making those damage types just slightly more potent, by like +1 or +2 damage points -- enough so that the deva's resistance is still very useful, but also enough to add up into substantial extra hurt to the rest of the party over the course of an adventuring day.  This will make the deva's special ability even more crucial and decisive.  I'm not sure about this, though.  It might put too much emphasis on the deva's one ability.<br/><br/>Like I said, it really comes down to what the player needs to have fun.  Some players want their DM to be a home-run contest pitcher who sets them up for awesome; others want to face off against a steely-eyed mound monster with a Saturn-V fastball and a Yoda curveball who makes them struggle for it.<br/><br/>Both roles are rewarding to me.  They have to be, because no matter how much I talk about game-planning around abilities, it's very difficult to do so.  With five PCs at level 6 + magic items + followers + player skill, there's a lot of firepower at the table.  Generally, the harder I work at being that badass mound monster, the faster the table party exposes me as a slo-pitch oldtimer.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>David, I hope this remains useful.

You know how the TV series <i>Lost</i> works?  Kinda like that: a "current" plot with flashback scenes interspersed throughout.  <br/><br/>As the skill challenge goes on, the players explain how their characters meet and learn about the evil villain's plans.  Success at the skill challenge gives them some benefit: maybe they know the villains ultimate goal and how to stop it.  Maybe they have the ancient artifact instead of the bad guys.  Something useful in the dungeon but not until late int he story.  What's guaranteed is that the PCs will wind up together at the dungeon, ready to kill some monsters.<br/><br/>Every couple of minutes (ten or twenty minutes or so, depending on the time you have and the complexity of the skill challenge chosen) you do a short flashback scene, where we establish a bit about the character, and they roll a single skill to aid in the skill challenge.  And possibly get a bonus for involving another PC (like a +2 bonus from Aid Another).  Resolve the result of their skill check, then go back to the current adventure and play out a bit more of the dungeon.  A bit more adventuring, then another flashback focusing on a different PC.  Repeat until every PC has had the spotlight, and the skill challenge is resolved somehow and the plot is now clear to everyone.<br/><br/>I have had lots of success using skill challenge based flashbacks to flesh out what's going on in the game.  And it would mean the game starts right at the heart of the game: at the point where the adventurers meet the monsters.  Then you go back and explain why it's all happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219622/#Comment_219622" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T12:36:43+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 12:36PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree with that assessment, Johnzo.<br/><br/>Another angle to take, which has worked for me as DM: Roleplay the monsters.

Pretty easy to hack the PC-recognize-monsters check to recognize PC abilities, though (Base DC of 20 to recognize powers, plus 5 for Paragon or +10 for Epic, uses Nature/Religion/Arcana based on power source).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219696/#Comment_219696" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T18:37:39+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  6:37PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 6:53PM by johnzo.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>If it were me, I'd tie how intelligently I got to fight with the late encounters and boss encounter by which special powers got used in the early encounters...and how many lesser folks escaped to tell about it.

If a monster gets away, future encounters become more difficult as the monsters' allies are all alerted and moved into guard and ambush points. But tracking intelligence about party members -- who's been recognized, what powers they are known to have, what group roles they fulfill, what monster made their Recognize PC Ability roll, and which of those monsters escaped, etc, etc -- that's an impractical amount of state for me to maintain over the course of the adventure, especially across multiple sessions of play.  I have enough trouble keeping track of who has used action points and daily powers...<br><br>Plus, I don't think anyone at our table really rocks the Sim agenda, so this would be extra work for questionable payoff.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219697/#Comment_219697" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T18:50:49+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  6:50PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>I have had lots of success using skill challenge based flashbacks to flesh out what's going on in the game.

We hadn't left off with any dungeon at all: they were back in town trying to track down an NPC.  But we used a flashback skill challenge to determine how they got from town to the dungeon.  The stakes of the challenge were "do you know of the villain's plans when you enter the dungeon, or are you going in there blind?".  Then the PCs used their various investigative skills to find out why they were (in present time) fighting a horde of undead in an abandoned temple.  Basically, that's what I'm proposing, with bringing the party together as part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/threegee" title="threegee"><img alt="threegee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/threegee">threegee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219887/#Comment_219887" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:45:04+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:45PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I'd make players rue the monster that got away to tell everyone about the Tiefling's fire resistance or "oh my god don't get caught bunched together or the dude with the funny had will fry your ass".
