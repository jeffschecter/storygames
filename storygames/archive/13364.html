There are no "fake" fights in Sorcerer where it's obvious one side or another is going to win because that's how the story "should" go in terms of Hollywood action-film expectations.  A really good rule of thumb is to make sure you can identify something at stake in the fight OTHER than whether the PC lives or dies.<br/><br/>Along similar lines there are no "mook" fights.  Note: There ARE mook rules in the core book but I generally only use those when color demands that it would be non-sensical for nameless guys not to be there.  For example, a PC says he's going to go confront Lord Jareth in his throne room.  It really strains credibility that Lord Jareth would not have some personal guard there.  So if a fight breaks out I treat those guys as 3 die mooks.  What I never, EVER, do is just have a group of nameless cronies show up for the sake of having what amounts to an expository fight sequence where the PC gets to "show off" some moves in guaranteed win situation.<br/><br/>Learn to split the PC's priorities by announcing really complex actions among the NPC, ESPECIALLY the demons.  I once had an AMAZING fight sequence where a PC's father had summoned a demon to try and usurp power from the Lord under whom the PC served in his militia.  These are the actions I announced about two or three rounds into the fight.<br/><br/>The Lord steps forward and raises his sword for a killing blow on your father. (He had been knocked prone the previous round).<br/>Your father raises his arm to defend himself.<br/>Your father's demon leaps to attack your Lord.<br/>Your demonic sword lurches in your hand to attack your father's demon. (It was part of the PC's setup that the demonic sword housed the soul of the PC's fellow militia man.  As far as I was concerned the sword was 100% loyal to the Lord.  This was also bad because the PC up until this point had been going out of his way NOT to antagonize his father's demon).<br/><br/>See how fucked up this is?  The PC gets ONE action.  Just one.  Call off his sword from attacking the demon he's afraid of angering?  Leap to his father's defense and defy his Lord?  Defend is Lord from a demonic death?  Something else?  Remember that we also have ZERO idea in what order any of these things will happen.<br/><br/>Remember that not everything you do has to be an attack.  Bonus Dice (PCs only) and Roll Over Victories (PCs and NPCs) are your friend.  Doing a "setup action" with  a follow up attack can be devastating.  Best example from my play:<br/><br/>A PC was in a bar fight.  The NPC shot a nail gun at him.  The player said announced that he was picking up a table to use as a shield.  He succeeded.  He then said, "Okay, I now take the nail studded table and impale the guy."  Bam.  He rolled over his victories from his defense right into his attack.<br/><br/>Hope that's useful.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_301166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301166/#Comment_301166" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T14:45:47+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  2:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2010 2:48PM by The_Magus.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse<br/><br/>Hurry up and write 'Play Sorcerer'<br/><br/>Regards<br/>Piers<br/><br/>[edit] - Yes, I know Christopher Kubasik is still working on it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301171/#Comment_301171" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T14:57:32+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  2:57PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't Chris K. like a big shot now?

Those dice work best when they have a very narrow very strict definition of when to award them (as I believe the core book provides)...you definitely don't want to treat them like fan mail or "just because".  But you can change the standard and come up with new narrow and strict definitions of when to award them, in order to feature / encourage a particular aspect of sword and sorcery action you want to see.<br/><br/>For instance, you might award a die for acting without thinking or planning about it.  And here I mean the player not thinking about it.  So there's the situation, what do you do..."boom I do this" no waffling, no analysing the angles in the free and clear stage, just act and damn the torpedoes.  If that's the kind of sword and sorcery characters you have / want that would be an easy way to get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301196/#Comment_301196" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T22:40:11+00:00" title="November 17, 2010 10:40PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not specific for ...and Sword, but: I think it's really important to have your one-sheet stuff worked out and very clear with everybody ahead of time.
