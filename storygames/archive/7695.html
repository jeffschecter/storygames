Suffice to say, we tried to make good with all of our customers and I'd like to personally thank everyone for their patience and consideration. Despite the problems, the reaction from people who have bought that books has been wonderful.<br/><br/>If anyone would like to discuss the issues arising out of these problems or if anyone has thoughts about the solutions linked to above, then I'd be delighted to chat about them. One thing this has really reinforced for me is that the great strength of the small press community is the immediacy of contact that we have with the people who buy and play our games. This was driven home to me by this entire experience. We had emails from people saying things like "I've never seen [insert name of huge games company] do something like this!" The fact that publishers and customers can have these positive dialogues, even in a situation where things have gone wrong, is something that makes me extremely happy.<br/><br/>So, all of that aside, we now have completely new, pristine, problem free copies of both games in stock at our own <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/shop.html" rel="nofollow">on-line shop</a> and at <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/manufacturers.php?manufacturerid=12" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a>. Great!<br/><br/>Not familiar with either of these titles? Then here's a brief run-down of both of these fine games:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/hotmain.html" rel="nofollow">Hot War</a> is a game of friends, enemies, secrets and consequences in the aftermath of a horrific war.<br/><br/>This alternative history/horror game for three or more participants has players dealing with life a year after the apocalypse. You'll confront hidden agendas, sinister factional machinations and see the changes in relations with friends and enemies.<br/><br/>Hot War allows both short term and campaign play, with a system that allows the group to work out exactly the kind of game they want to play amongst the monster strewn wreckage of 1960s London.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/coldprev.html" rel="nofollow">Cold City 1.1</a> is all about hidden agendas, trust and monster hunting in 1950 Berlin.<br/><br/>In Cold City, players take the role of a member of the Reserve Police Agency, those secretive Cold War monster hunters. Characters are defined not just by who they are and what they are like, but by the views of the other characters and the trust that they have in them. For each character is, at the outset, seen as a national stereotype, a clich\xe9d representative of their chosen nation. But is this really the case? Do they live up to the stereotype or do they show themselves to be wholly unique individuals? And how does this affect the trust that the other character have in them?<br/><br/>Both titles are available from our <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/shop.html" rel="nofollow">on-line shop</a> and from those fine people at <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/manufacturers.php?manufacturerid=12" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a>!<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170964/#Comment_170964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T11:47:45+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:47AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good news, glad to see that it's all sorted out with the printers and the books are out there again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
