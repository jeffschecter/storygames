Otherwise my legacy as the "the Indie RPG guy" has been in inaugurating a tradition of lifting little design elements from Story Games wholecloth and depositing them where possible in "the classics" just to give some meat to the world's characters and their stories. <br/><br/>For example, before my insidious influence no two PCs would have thought to establish how they knew each other before the adventure. These days the playgroup is super happy with announcing their prior relationship to the person to their left. Basic world building stuff, right?<br/><br/>You can see my frustration. They enjoy Story Games when they happen, but they won't initiate. It's got smoother with time, but busy graduate lives have reduced my ability to better my fellows and I'm desperately casting around for potent design nostrums I can drop on my less-than-receptive group in my flyby visits. <br/><br/>What little tools do you have in your collective pockets to boost basic elements like Character, Narrative, Theme or Mood? <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>---<br/>Postscript. Yeah, sure, in a perfect world I'd have a frank and meaningful discussion with my group about what they want from play. Sometimes these conversations just aren't comfortable or willingly entered into by all parties. <i>Primetime Adventures</i> was so divisive that a second season is unlikely to ever get off the ground, <i>Last Train Out of Warsaw</i> crumbled mid-game and had to be stopped, loosing me much credibility, and that <i>Polaris</i> even exists is a running joke at my expense. That said, I love these people and I want to play with them. They like what I do to their games, they just can't swallow big pills. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446612/#Comment_446612" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T11:30:04+00:00" title="July 15, 2015 11:30AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 11:38AM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found a couple of things that slot into my D&amp;D game:<br/>\u2022 The "ok, but HOW are you doing it" from AW, DW and "Old School Primer" way of resolving skills.

In that book I deliberately fused "Trad" and "Modern" techniques with elements lifted from the Storygame toolbox to create a hybrid sketchily-prepped experience with a strong narrative arc.  Bits of DayTrippers that I would suggest as answers to your question...<br/><br/>- <b>Shared Action Resolution</b> (Bipartite resolution in which Players narrate positive results and the GM narrates negative ones)<br/>- <b>Progressive Character Generation</b> (char points may be spent during early adventures)<br/>- <b>LifeShaping Events</b> (things that drive the character, narrative hooks on PC sheet)<br/>- <b>LifeShaping Dice</b> (if a LifeShaper can be tied to a move, Player gets an extra die)<br/>- <b>Character Development Scenes</b> (once per session each Player may call for one. If the scene gives the GM a problem/hook, PC gets 1XP. If the scene provides a creative solution to a current problem, PC gets 1 XP. May include LifeShapers.)<br/><br/>The above techniques could all (in theory) be lifted out, tweaked slightly, and used in any system or setting.  In addition, if you actually run a game of DayTrippers, there are environment types in the game which are designed to yield a large amount of chaotic material for Players to project on, and for that material to be incorporated back into the fiction in meaningful ways.<br/><br/>- <i>Subjective Slips</i> to <i>Dream Worlds</i> are one example, in which the laws of physics, logic and the line between objective and subjective may be suspended.  Characters may learn the skill of <i>Lucid Dreaming</i> and literally take over for the GM momentarily.<br/><br/>- <i>The Multiversal Chao</i> - a swirling non-reality comprised of bits of other realities - is a psychological bath of collaborative fiction that arises spontaneously based on both random and "automatic" cues from both Players and GM.  It's storygamey chaos on a stick, surrealistic collaboration, with everyone rolling to maintain their sanity every frame.

If they don't want to take initiative, you can still often pull things out of them by leading them there.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>1. To establish a character's values, ask provocative questions, a la AW. "What's your character's biggest nightmare?" "What would that look like?"<br/><br/>If they're really resistant, you can mechanize it. ("Ok, each you if you get one 'Protector' token. You can assign that token to the person your character cares about most [not a PC]. They get to spend that token for a +1 on any saving throw, should they need it.")<br/><br/>("Name a personal goal for your character, unrelated to adventuring. It's now worth 750XPs." "Who does your character hate the most? Write that down; you'll get a +1 on any roll which leads to them being hurt, humiliated, or taken down a notch.")<br/><br/>2. Scene framing: it's easy to get players to do this for you just by doing a little questioning, too.<br/><br/>GM: "Who do you want to talk to next?"<br/>Players: "We need to go talk to the General!"<br/>GM: "Where do you think he would be right now?"<br/>Players: "Probably having lunch in his tent, surrounded by his generals."<br/>GM: "Ok, great: so you walk into the tent to see the General eating roast pheasant. They've got a map spread out on the table, marking the enemy's position..."<br/><br/>When I do this, nobody notices that *I* wasn't the one who effectively framed the scene - the players did it, I just narrated it for them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446659/#Comment_446659" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T18:46:05+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  6:46PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 6:47PM by Isaac.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joking answer: Hit them with Burning Wheel, tell them it's an ultra-crunchy fantasy game in a gritty setting, and get them addicted to writing Beliefs for their characters. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>More seriously, don't try to sneak a whole new game on them without warning.

When the camera lights upon their PC, I ask them what's the next thing we see.<br/><br/>Basically shifting their point of view from internal to external.

I do understand it can be frustrating when you really like an approach and the group doesn't want to do it. It is especially frustrating if their dislike of something stems from not wanting to try things with an open mind. But ultimately it is their right to be that way. I would probably be a bit resentful if a person snuck something in like this, not because my game was tainted by stuff I think I don't like, but because it shows a lack of respect for me. It would be similar to knowing someone refuses a certain kind of food for whatever reason and sneaking it in. It isn't your place to force someone to try things. It is also intellectually insulting. <br/><br/>That said I think if you have an open discussion people will likely be receptive to some things. For example the whole connecting back stories and PCs prior to play is well established in traditional campaigns (that is something I have seen and used since the late 80s).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447682/#Comment_447682" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-06T21:02:14+00:00" title="August  6, 2015  9:02PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2015 9:02PM by Deliverator.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For once I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>.<br/><br/>One thing that I have found to be true in both discussion and play regarding indie / hippy / story-gaming etc. is that <i>if</i> you are frustrated by the way your group currently does things, you need a new group, even more than a new system.

And believe me when I say I've been there, trying to sneak all sort of tricks and turn things upside down behind my GM screen. It's useless. <br/><br/>I added Fate aspects to my game and players started hitting them buttons like mad trying to game the system, and reciting them whenever they felt they were about to get in trouble just to get some hero points. After a couple of times it didn't added story to the game but it became a sort of internal joke.<br/><br/>I tried mechanics that made roleplaying needed to gain more power, and again the players were able to tell instinctively there was a button to extert advantages from the setting, and so it became commonplace to hit it. Or when the mechanic felt too circumstantial or convoluted, they plainly stopped using it.<br/><br/>Lately I've seen that it's often my very own fault. Yes, I want there to be more story, more drama, more roleplaying, but am I actually putting it myself on the story? Or I'm just waiting for them to interact with the NPCs that have scenes written in order to put some story myself? Is it that they haven't reached the place of the map where everything happens and so I'll have to keep rolling random encounters until they get there?<br/><br/>So with a wide degree of success I tried switching gears. On a random encounter I felt that after the initial surprise scene (the monster got the initiative and the party made a mistake I took to make the scene more interesting) and a couple of hits with poison and using all the creture tricks, the rest of the battle was just going to be rolling dice and exchanging numbers. So I interrupted the battle narrating how the whole forest around them started to move under a fierce wind... but with some rythm. I looked at them and started moving my arms and making sounds to represent a gigantic creature flying. They all opened their eyes and said "\xa1A DRAGON!" <br/><br/>Frag the random encounter, it was sent flying and I asked everyone for a strength save or be sent flying too. All creatures in the forest run away and I got rid of the random encounter table for the rest of the session, as it made sense nothing except them would dare remain in the area. Of course, they went to investigate...<br/><br/>On other campaign, I was kinda burnt by the prep and hadn't put much effort into it lately. The players were in the middle of a randomly generated dungeon (please, don't use those generated online, most of them look good enough on the screen but suck big time on play) controlled by a fanatic cult. When they had reached the middle of the dungeon they suddenly came up with the idea of making a fanatic cult of their own. <br/><br/>On another occasion I would had considered this a potential campaign-breaker and perhaps I'd even present other options and events until they forget about it. But I honestly loved the idea: for once they finally had the initiative of stopping to blindly follow clues and quests through the setting and building something themselves. I decided to play along and quickly made some rulings about convincing people into their cult and by the end of the session they had turned half the town into it. By the next the villains were sending them their spies and minions while they were training minions of their own. They finally guided them to "the promised city in the clouds" an ancient mobile base they used for the final assault. It was totally worth it.<br/><br/>So, instead of adding rules, look at the parts of the game you haven't been using that are somewhat story-related, talk with the players about what do they want from the game, tell them what would you like the game to have and then see if you actually need new mechanics; by then you'd probably actually need less than you think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447690/#Comment_447690" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T05:13:16+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  5:13AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think people are missing in the OP that the group is open for story mechanics, but they are don't have the confident/experience in using them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447691/#Comment_447691" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T08:44:12+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  8:44AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can bring them in through the front door openly, that's all I'm saying.

In fact if they are open to such mechanics, he has no excuse to not have a discussion with them about what kind of game he wants. The attitude that the OP is bringing here to the group is one that would seriously bother me as a player or GM even if I liked the stuff he likes. It's one where the person inserts things in a sneaky way, and suggests they know what is best for everyone. Talk to people, find out what they want and what they are open to doing during the regular game (it may simply be they are happy to play fiasco as a separate thing, but don't want that in their regular game, or it may be they are totally open to it in their regular game).

It is incredibly deceitful and condescending to approach your game group like this. If you have so little respect for them that you feel the need to bring them 'up to your level' there is a bigger problem than Playstyle.<br/><br/>If he doesn't want a new group, then he either needs to have a frank discussion or accept things as they are. If he can't do those things, he absolutely needs to find players more suited to his style. <br/><br/>I am not taking anything out of context. The OP was pretty clear about what he was doing.

Players need to take initiative for that to work, and sometimes it requires training wheels. Doing that is perfectly okay if your are upfront about. Saying "this is a sandbox game, and I am going to show you how it is done" is totally fine. However if I had a group of story gamers and told them we were going to run something narrative, while I secretly groomed them for sandbox play, I think there would be an issue. I think it would also be a problem is I felt I was superior to the narrative players and needed to fix them. When I read the whole post by the OP, I get a much different impression than you seem to have. If he is slowly introducing elements, being open about it, and they are fine with it, that's great. I don't get the impression that is what is going on exactly. <br/><br/>I think if you go into a game as a GM with the attitude, I am going to show them what is cool about X; and your honest about what your doing, it is fine. On the other hand, if your approach is, I need to fix these people and bring them to my level, so I am going to slip stuff in, then there is an issue. My problem with the OP is it is a bit unclear where he resides on that spectrum and my gut says it is closer to the latter based on the entirety of the post. Perhaps I am incorrect in my assessment and the OP can correct me. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447718/#Comment_447718" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T16:27:05+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  4:27PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps it's a cultural thing, perhaps it's my personal way to see the world, but I think it's polite to think the best of any stranger even when their choice of words is poor or expresses an opinion we're totally against. That person usually has a good reason for saying such things in public, so I often try to put myself on their shoes and ask before calling them one thing or the other.<br/><br/>So, I can't really say that I have met a GM that has walked into a game session thinking "I'm going to have fun by cheating all these fools into doing my bidding", but instead they are mostly thinking about "What can I do to have fun with my friends, myself included?"<br/><br/>So yeah, the road to hell is paved with good intentions but come on, the OP isn't asking "How do I lie better to my players?". I've been in similar shoes and I get the vibe that their players have an idea of the game that he doesn't often share, but that he feels that asking his players to play it like "another game" is like imposing on them and therefore, too much. Instead, asking them "I want to try X ruling and see what happens" and expect it produces the gameplay you want may feel less intrusive.<br/><br/>My point in my previous post is that trying to be less intrusive is actually what doesn't work. Players will probably love this shiny new ruling and adapt to their own way of playing, instead of realizing that the GM isn't having the same fun as them. So, being open and direct about it isn't only for the sake of being a more honest person, but for practical reasons. The players will never understand you're not enjoying the game as much as them if you keep using indirects and never telling them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447719/#Comment_447719" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T16:40:30+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  4:40PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2015 4:43PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am happy to give people the benefit of the doubt, and I said I could be wrong and am interested in any clarification by the OP. But it's in the thread title and it is in the body text of the post of the itself in more than one instance. All I have to go by is what the poster said.  When someone says 'how can I sneak this in' and mentions their 'nefarious influence' on the game, and describes introducing mechanics as a big pill, I think it is fair to be critical and push back a bit against the notion of sneaking things into play when there is a potential conflict of style/preference at the table.? The postscript also suggests issues at the table. Others who normally disagree with me on lots things have had a similar reaction so I don't think it is a wild interpretation of the post.

If he isn't arguing for sneaking things like that, and his position is actually a bit more nuanced, I am happy to acknowledge I was incorrect in my assessment of his position.

I tried it twice - once using a game mechanic that was not actually a real mechanic at all, it was a system that disguised 'making up a result' as a dice roll and rewarded players for being highly descriptive by having them succeed when they were and fail when they were not. The second time I got them to improvise most of an adventure without realising it by asking them what they thought about things and what they thought was going on as we went along and whenever they gave me an answer treating it as if they had succeeded or failed in working out something I had pre-planned when actually all I had was a quick story seed noted down.<br/><br/>The first unfortunately tended to mean eloquent players dominated the game and the second people really enjoyed until I told them what I had done, at which point they all suddenly felt cheated because they had thought they were being really clever in working everything out.<br/><br/>After that I decided to just not sneak things in and either play with people who wanted to try out the same things I was interested in or simply invest in playing what they wanted to play and make the most of it. End of the day I just started to ask people - would you like to do/use this right now?<br/><br/>Sometimes using things like giving characters hereditary holdings when they were created that they could invest in manage helped, the later lifted from Pendragon and dropped in other games (it worked quite well in Vampire as a way of their running business empires through a long dark Ages Campaign). They would jolt players into thinking about long term goals, their past and how they were relating to others (PCs and NPCs) a bit more but I think it only really helps when its pretty obviously useful in the game. So often it comes down to what players think they are going to get from it - in this case it was an increase in their sense of their characters power and prestige in the game. <br/><br/>I have always found successes with some groups/gamers tended to be a bit hit or miss - I once got a group playing Two Fisted Tales to provide sound effects in game when their character was idle or elsewhere and everyone loved it - but they never felt comfortable doing it in any other game. <br/><br/>I just took peoples interest when it was there and ran with it and shrugged off the times when it wasn't... eventually the composition of the gaming group changed and I had a lot of new players who were more open to trying things largely because they actually had very little idea of what alternatives there were... and then we started seriously playing games with more storytelling and even deliberately and knowingly improvising them as a group.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449114/#Comment_449114" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-24T19:19:33+00:00" title="October 24, 2015  7:19PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2015 8:20PM by AsIf.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience largely concurs, <a href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">@Hybridartifacts</a>.

Standard rant <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a> was called "<a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/reference/index.php/welcome/topic/9812" rel="nofollow">You can't sneak up on mode,"</a>, and it argued that "sneaking up on mode" was a bad idea, because if a game were functioning well, trying to make little changes would just be frustrating. As Mike said:\n<blockquote>The most common thing that happens when you do make such alterations is that no change in play mode occurs at all. The players still only see the game's original message, and they don't adjust in any way. Which is hugely frustrating to the GM in question as they really thought that the little changes would be fun and get the players to participate in the desired mode. Often whole rules just get entirely ignored. <br/><br/>The second most common thing is that the players alter their mode a little, but then complain that they're being made to do things that are uncomfortable, boring, or just not what they expect out of play. Canalized players know what they want, and even when they're presented with something that\u2019s potentially fun, they might not see where it's fun. Especially if it happens to conflict with what they normally consider fun. Again, this is just making things incoherent. <br/><br/>And it doesn't matter how long you discuss matters like this outside of the game. Play of any mode has an intuitive sense that one can only obtain through participation. Remember those people you introduced to RPGs, and their first awkward moments with it? None of it is really "natural" and so expecting to be able to talk someone into an understanding of it is just asking too much. <br/><br/>Prompting in play can be the worst option because then the player may come to resent the GM for the above reasons. They "just want to have fun" and here you are trying to "fix" their play. </blockquote>\nMike's advice to folks who wanted to introduce a different agenda to their play group was to stop and pick a game that strongly supported that agenda from the get-go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449164/#Comment_449164" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-27T07:22:00+00:00" title="October 27, 2015  7:22AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought this thread was about implementing story game typical elements in traditional roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449167/#Comment_449167" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-27T16:53:09+00:00" title="October 27, 2015  4:53PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I thought this thread was about implementing story game typical elements in traditional roleplaying games.</blockquote>\nIt is, and I think what Bill is saying is "It doesn't work."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449168/#Comment_449168" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-27T16:56:57+00:00" title="October 27, 2015  4:56PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2015 5:24PM by AsIf.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I already posted about how this works in DayTrippers (see above), but feel free to ignore my input.

It was also not Mike's ( <a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin%27s%29">@Potemkin's)</a> question.<br/><br/>Mike (who is at least passingly familiar with DT, as one of its originators), said "I'm desperately casting around for potent design nostrums..."<br/><br/>I mentioned some "Bits of DayTrippers that I would suggest as answers to your question..." and went on to list and summarize those bits for the uninitiated.  Among them: "Bipartite resolution in which Players narrate positive results and the GM narrates negative ones."  Much like the techniques Sandra ( <a href="/forums/profile/2097%29">@2097)</a> posted earlier, this technique can be applied to almost any RPG.  Same with the other techniques I mentioned, to varying degrees.  The fact that it came from DayTrippers is just a genealogical detail (later downthread I make another suggestion that did <i>not</i> come from DT).<br/><br/>So that's one thing.  Then another separate thing happens: <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> mentions he thinks this thread is about "implementing story game typical elements in traditional roleplaying games" and you suggested that it was, and that <a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">@Bill_White</a> had answered the question.  I'm not really sure why you felt a need to respond at that moment, but the combination of your post and Bill's post made it seem that you consider the question categorically closed.  Perhaps you do.<br/><br/>But as can be seen from other suggestions in thread (not just mine), the question is not closed.  There have been quite a few suggestions and some related experiences, both successful and not.<br/><br/>I think there's something about the unfortunately off-the-cuff title of this thread that puts people in a defensive mood.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449171/#Comment_449171" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-27T19:38:39+00:00" title="October 27, 2015  7:38PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My point was that Mike's (<a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a>, I mean) experience seems to confirm Mike Holmes' observation--the group he plays with will adopt some story-gaming techniques piece-meal, but actually shifting their style of play to a different mode is something that they're unwilling to do. I assume this means that they're enjoying the games that they're playing the way that they're playing them. That's hard to change. Arguably, the techniques that Mike is looking for are ones that are somehow consistent with both what he wants and what they want. So I would say we need more description of what they like--what are the moments that seem to energize the other people at the table--and that will possibly help identify specific techniques that will "stick" the way that "invent connections at the table" did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449172/#Comment_449172" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-27T20:05:15+00:00" title="October 27, 2015  8:05PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

Be prepared for failure as well as success (it's just a question of personal preference, after all, and even then some people are resistant to change in principle).<br/><br/>b) I want to include some "story gamey" mechanics or techniques in my games for my own enjoyment as the GM (or a player, although that's not as easy).<br/><br/>I think there are ways to do b) which don't step on anyone's toes, like, for example, using Flags from character write-ups. (A Flag is some feature of the character which indicates the player's interest in something: you then use that Flag to include relevant material in the game itself.) If you don't get any useful Flags from character creation, you can tease some out through provocative questioning or oblique techniques like character journals (if your players are into that kind of thing). <br/><br/>It's possible that such a technique conflicts with whatever your group is grooving on (what some call creative agenda), but not likely - just keep your ears open as you try different things.<br/><br/>Mike asking "what little tools do you have to boost..." sounds more like the latter to me. Can you play up certain story game elements or mechanics in your game without "breaking" the mode of play or destroying what's fun about your games? Of course you can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
