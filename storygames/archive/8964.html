Maybe introduce a method for allowing the players to request the style of the next scene? Make it really clear that everyone gets a turn to engage with something they enjoy?<br/><br/>They all seem to be at a good age for doing stuff normally considered "out of game" too, like blue-booking or semi-larpish stuff, too. Have you read HG Wells' Floor Games? It's a sort've AP report on proto-RPGing, you might check out. I know Project Gutenberg has some text-only versions up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198136/#Comment_198136" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T06:32:45+00:00" title="March 21, 2009  6:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess you could make a combat-heavy mission that revolves around rescuing a hunky guy? That way the lad would have plenty of action, and the ladies could have fun vieing for the affections of the guy they're rescuing.<br/><br/>It's definately a difficult one though, no doubt about it, and I don't think any middle ground is ever going to be ideal. Well, unless you can sell the lad on social combat as an alternative to beating things up, but given the circumstances I can't help but think that's an unlikely solution.<br/><br/>Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
